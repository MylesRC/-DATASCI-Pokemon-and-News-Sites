        "full article": "A New Jersey appeals court on Thursday ruled against famed pop artist Peter Max in a dispute over millions of dollars\u00b4 worth of his works that were damaged in a warehouse during Superstorm Sandy. The German-born Max, whose distinctive psychedelic drawings have been widely reproduced on posters and postage stamps and exhibited in museums since the 1960s, has claimed an arbitrator\u00b4s $48 million insurance award was too low. Thousands of his paintings, posters and other works were damaged at a warehouse in Lyndhurst in northern New Jersey when Superstorm Sandy hit the area in late October 2012, according to court documents. When Max and his insurers, Great American Security and Lloyds, couldn't agree on a cost for the damages, a former New Jersey Supreme Court justice was designated to resolve the dispute. Max and his associated companies allege the justice incorrectly calculated the worth of the damaged works by applying a discount to some entire categories, including posters. A lower court judge had ruled the valuations were appropriate and that Max's approach \"overlooked the possibility that many of the items had not sold in the past and that the entire body of works likely would not in the future be sold at these prices,\" according to Thursday's ruling.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File)  The appeals court also wrote in its ruling that it lacked jurisdiction and left the lower court's decision undisturbed. An attorney representing Max said he was reviewing the opinion and considering whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court. \"This appeal raises important and novel questions concerning the valuation of insurance claims under policies covering fine arts collections,\" attorney Bradley Nash said. \"Despite the important public policy issues presented, the Appellate Division declined to exercise its supervisory authority and did not reach the merits of the appeal. We are evaluating all options.\"",

The NSW Government says many as 20 wild dogs are operating in the Hawks Nest Tea Gardens areaRules that will be enforced include securing bins properly and making sure food scraps are not easily accessible.\u00a0'Our Rangers will be following up on reports of residents feeding dingoes, but the compliance issue also falls to instances where bins haven\u2019t been secured properly and food scraps are easily accessible,' Mr Bell said.Dingoes are classified as a 'pest' and a 'wild dog' by the NSW government because of the threat to pose to livestock.\u00a0The dingo is Australia's only native canine and is protected in national parks under the Nature Conservation Act 1992.There are three types of purebred dingos - inland and tropical, alpine - and the alpine species is the only one that is endangered.However in some areas of Queensland they are classified as a pest.Most dingoes in Australia are hybrids mixed with dogs, with the potential extinction of pure-bred dingoes being predicted since 2011.\u00a0AUSTRALIA'S DIFFERENT KINDS OF DINGOES  The dingo is Australia's largest mammal carnivore, and there are three types.\u00a0\u00a0Dingoes have a dog-like appearance, with a relatively broad head and erect ears.\u00a0Dingoes tend to howl and rarely bark. They usually howl at night to ward off intruders or attract pack members.\u00a0They are opportunistic carnivores and typically feed off other mammals such as rabbits, kangaroos, wallabies and wombats.\u00a0Pure dingoes breed once a year, between March and June, with a gestation period of about nine weeks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tropical dingoes come from the Kimberley and Plbara areas, inland dingoes live int he deserts and central parts of the country, and Wandi's type is the alpine dingo.The alpine dingo is the breed that is most concerning as it is believed to be highly endangered.Alpine dingoes are found on the eastern seaboard areas, where 80 per cent of Australia's population lives.\u00a0The habitat of the alpine dingo is decreasing, while the persecution of the animal is also pushing the dingo close to extinction.\u00a0 \u00a0Source: Australian Museum\u00a0Advertisement",

        "full article": "Sophomore guard Tre Mann has been the driving force for the Florida Gators since they lost preseason SEC Player of the Year Keyontae Johnson back in December. Mann proved it again on Thursday, finishing with 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists and making the clutch plays down the stretch in a 69-63 win over Vanderbilt. It was the Gators' first win when scoring under 70 points this season. \"My mindset was to not let my team lose,\" Mann said. \"That's my mindset for the whole tournament.\" Mann, an All-SEC first teamer averaging 15.0 points per game, was back at the team hotel dealing with a migraine last Sunday when Florida lost to Tennessee 65-54 in Knoxville. Barring anything unforeseen, Mann will be back on the court when the fifth-seeded Gators (14-8) play the fourth-seeded Volunteers (17-7) in an SEC tournament quarterfinal on Friday afternoon. The teams meet for the second time in five days after splitting the season series. Mann scored 12 points on 6-for-11 shooting in Florida's 75-49 victory over Tennessee in Gainesville on Jan. 19. Noah Locke (14 points) and Tyree Appleby (13 points, seven assists) also had a big role in handing the Volunteers -- then ranked No. 6 in the nation -- their most lopsided defeat this season despite not having Colin Castleton in that game. Victor Bailey Jr., John Fulkerson and Keon Johnson each scored 14 points to lead a balanced Tennessee attack in the Vols' victory on Sunday. Tennessee did not fare well from 3-point range in either game, shooting 3-for-18 and 3-for-21 respectively. But Tennessee played much better in the half-court game and was strong at the rim in its recent victory, outrebounding Florida 34-26 and 15-8 on the offensive glass. Tennessee is also looking for a better performance from leading scorer Jaden Springer (12.4 points per game), who was held to four points on 2-for-7 shooting on Sunday. \"We played hard Sunday,\" Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. \"We were emotional. Once we settled in, we played 25 good minutes. I'm not saying we didn't play well to start with, but we had the tempo going, we had shots that we didn't knock down. I do like the fact that (the week off) has allowed us to get healthy.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By Martyn Herman LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho said he was confident striker Harry Kane would be available to face Arsenal on Sunday after suffering an injury in his side's Europa League win over Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday. England skipper Kane struck both goals in a 2-0 win for his side to take his tally for the season to 26, but needed an ice pack on his knee after being substituted late on. \"I hope so and I believe so,\" Mourinho said when asked whether Kane would be okay for the north London derby which is vital to Tottenham's hopes of challenging for a top-four finish in the Premier League. \"It's a big match. I think only a big problem would stop him from being there, which I don't think it is. But let's see the reaction tomorrow. Hopefully, he'll be fine.\" Kane scored in each half to give Tottenham a comfortable cushion ahead of the second leg of their last 16 tie in Croatia next week, although Mourinho warned the job was not done. \"They defended well. When the result was 1-0 in the second half they tried to keep that result so they still stayed in a low block and defended well,\" Mourinho said. \"So it's not easy. The result could be a little bit bigger. A third goal would have come and fit very well in the reality of the game, but it is what it is. \"2-0 at home is a very positive result but we did not kill the tie so it's still open.\" (Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond)",

        "full article": "Following is a summary of current US domestic news briefs. U.S. House passes two Democratic-backed gun control bills The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved a pair of gun control bills as Democrats seized upon a shifting political landscape that they said improved chances for enacting new laws after years of failed attempts. The first measure, which passed the Democratic-led House 227-203, would close a long-standing loophole in gun laws by expanding background checks to those purchasing weapons over the internet, at gun shows and through certain private transactions. Only eight Republicans joined the Democrats in backing the bill. U.S. lawmaker urges FAA to extend 'zero tolerance' policy past March 30 The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Thursday urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to extend a \"zero tolerance\" policy for passengers not wearing masks or causing disturbances on flights. In January, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson signed an order directing the policy after supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on some flights. Dickson warned that disruptive passengers could face up to $35,000 in fines and possible jail time and said the policy would last through March 30. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the transportation committee, urged Dickson to continue the \"policy until public health officials determine that mass vaccinations have eliminated the risk of infection\" on airplanes. Americans seek compensation for failed COVID-19 treatments from U.S. fund In March of last year, Steve Cicala took his wife, Susan, to the emergency room at Clara Maass Medical Center in New Jersey to treat a worsening cough and fever, unaware she had COVID-19. As her breathing and blood pressure deteriorated, she was given azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine and put on a ventilator. Eleven days after being admitted to the same hospital where she had worked for years as a nurse, Susan went into cardiac arrest and died at age 60. New York mayor joins calls for Cuomo to resign over sexual misconduct claims New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Andrew Cuomo \"just can't serve as governor anymore,\" adding his voice on Thursday to a growing chorus of calls for Cuomo to resign after six women accused him of sexual misconduct. Cuomo, 63, has denied the allegations by the women, most of whom are former aides. The most recent is an unnamed aide who told The Times-Union newspaper on Tuesday that Cuomo had groped her after calling her to the executive mansion last year under the pretext of business. Biden to direct states to make all adults eligble for vaccine by May 1 U.S. President Joe Biden will direct states to make all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccines by May 1 and declare that Americans should expect to be able to host neighborhood parties come the July 4 holiday during a prime-time television address on Thursday, according to two senior White House officials. Biden is expected to also announce the deployment of an additional 4,000 active-duty troops to help with vaccinations and the start of a web site that will alllow Americans to find out where they can get vaccinated, the senior officials said. Biden signs $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law on U.S. lockdown anniversary President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law on Thursday, commemorating the one-year anniversary of a U.S. lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic with a measure designed to bring relief to Americans and boost the economy. The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives gave final congressional approval to the measure on Wednesday, handing the Democratic president a major victory in the early months of his term. Pentagon accuses Fox News host of demeaning U.S. military with anti-woman segment The Pentagon said Fox News host Tucker Carlson \"essentially demeaned the entire U.S. military\" with a segment that decried increasing numbers of female service members and suggested they were weakening the U.S. armed forces. On Tuesday night the conservative commentator showed an Air Force photo of a 1st lieutenant modeling a maternity uniform, and said in the face of a growing threat from China the Pentagon could lose wars by drawing in more women. Mississippi governor signs law banning transgender athletes from women's sports Mississippi's Republican governor on Thursday signed legislation banning transgender athletes from competing in women and girls' sports, becoming the first U.S. state to do so this year. Governor Tate Reeves said a January executive order issued by President Joe Biden that protects transgender women and girls' ability to compete on sports teams that conform with their gender identity left the state \"no choice\" but to enact the Mississippi Fairness Act. Independent review criticizes Los Angeles police for handling of George Floyd protests Los Angeles Police Department commanders planned poorly for violent protests and looting that broke out following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, leading to a chaotic and inadequate response, an independent review said on Thursday. The review, commissioned by city leaders following nationwide demonstrations and rioting last year, was released as the trial opens in Minneapolis for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with killing Floyd on May 25, 2020. Number of migrant children in U.S. border facilities soars amid growing crisis More than 3,600 migrant children were being held in U.S. border facilities as of Thursday morning, a U.S. official told Reuters, more than four times the number in late February, a sign of a growing humanitarian and political crisis for President Joe Biden's new administration. The number of mostly Central American unaccompanied children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has risen rapidly in recent weeks, with more children stuck in border patrol stations while they await transfers to increasingly crowded federal shelters and eventual release to parents or other sponsors.",

Australia's previous finance minister and former European Union trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom from Sweden are the final two left in the race. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Mr Cormann has great support in his quest for the job. \"It's in extra time, it is into golden point,\" he told reporters in Sydney on Friday. \"It's a very important role. \"The OECD brings together like-minded countries from all around the world.\" Mr Cormann this week said he would pursue an ambitious and \"global\" approach to help countries become carbon-neutral by 2050. But about 30 Australian and global charities and research institutions recently signed a letter urging the Paris-based organisation to drop Mr Cormann from the race, saying he had a public record of \"thwarting effective climate action\". Ms Malmstrom would be the OECD's first female head if successful. As EU commissioner, she called on European countries to be more ambitious on issues such as climate change and pushed for greater environmental safeguards in trade agreements. The successful candidate chosen by the 37 member states will take over from current secretary-general Angel Gurria for a five-year term beginning on June 1. The UK's representative to the OECD, Christopher Sharrock, is chairing the committee responsible for selecting the new secretary-general. The fifth round of confidential negotiations with each member country has just finished. \"The chair has been unable to identify which candidate has the most support,\" a statement from Thursday says. \"Further steps will be taken in March, with the aim of concluding the process.\"",

She has said Cuomo asked about her sex life and propositioned her.At least five accusers - Bennett, Lindsey Boylan, Anna Liss, Karen Hinton and the unnamed woman - worked for the governor in Albany or during his time in President Bill Clinton's Cabinet. Another, Anna Ruch, told The New York Times that she met Cuomo at a friend's wedding.Cuomo has denied inappropriately touching anyone, but said he is sorry if he made anyone uncomfortable and didn't intend to do so.'As I said yesterday, I have never done anything like this.

She also claimed that he told her he was open to dating women in their 20s.\u00a0\u00a0         Charlotte Bennett, 25Anna Ruch, 33Anna Ruch was the third woman to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment and the only one thus far who did not work with him in a professional capacity.\u00a0She claimed that Cuomo\u00a0put his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her just moments after they met at a September 2019 wedding in Manhattan.\u00a0         Anna Ruch, 33Ana Liss, 35Ana Liss, who previously served as Cuomo's policy and operations aide between 2013 and 2015, told the Wall Street Journal that during her time in his administration, the governor had subjected her to unsolicited advances, including touching her lower back, kissing her hand and quizzing her about her love life.\u00a0         Ana Liss, 35Karen Hinton, 62\u00a0\u00a0The oldest allegations against Cuomo came from Karen Hinton, who served as a press aide for him when he led the US Department of Housing and Urban Development two decades ago\u00a0and she was a consultant for the agency. Hinton told the Washington Post about a 2000 incident when she said Cuomo summoned her to his 'dimly lit' hotel room and embraced her after a work event.\u00a0She said she tried to pull away from Cuomo when he pulled her back and held her before she managed to escape the room.\u00a0         Karen Hinton, 62Unnamed sixth accuserThe most damning allegations leveled against Cuomo to date came from a sixth accuser, whose name has not been released.\u00a0\u00a0The former aide claimed Cuomo called her to his Executive Mansion in Albany last year, saying he needed help fixing his cellphone.\u00a0The pair were alone together on the second level of the residence when the woman said Cuomo closed the door, reached under her blouse and fondled her before she told him to stop.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Advertisement\nThe Albany Police Department on Thursday confirmed that it had been formally notified by Cuomo's office over the sixth accuser's claims, which it said may have 'risen to the level of a crime'.\u00a0\u00a0A spokesperson for the department, Steve Smith, said that police had not received a formal complaint from the alleged victim, but they have reached out to a representative for her.This doesn't mean police have opened a criminal investigation, rather that the department has offered its services to the woman, 'as we would any other report or incident', Smith said.Albany PD said it received the referral from a state official on Wednesday night, shortly after an article was published in the Times Union that detailed the woman's accusations.\u00a0\u00a0Smith told the New York Times that the call alerting Albany PD to the latest allegation against Cuomo had initially come from the New York State Police.However, in a statement, Cuomo's acting counsel, Beth Garvey, confirmed it was her who had contacted authorities after a lawyer for the female aide told the governor\u2019s office that the aide did not want to file a report.'As a matter of state policy, when allegations of physical contact are made, the agency informs the complainant that they should contact their local police department,' Garvey clarified.\u00a0'If they decline, the agency has an obligation to reach out themselves and inform the department of the allegation.''In this case, the person is represented by counsel and when counsel confirmed the client did not want to make a report, the state notified the police department and gave them the attorney\u2019s information.'While the police department is just following standard procedure by reaching out to the alleged victim, the situation could quickly lead to potential criminal exposure for Cuomo, should the woman wish to pursue charges for unwanted touching.\u00a0Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan waded in on the scandal on Wednesday, tweeting a statement affirming that any other potential victims who wish to come forward will be properly assisted by police.'The act of speaking out after being victimized can be a deeply painful and traumatic experience,' Sheehan wrote.\u00a0'The young woman reference in recent reports has the right to determine who she speaks to regarding her experience and when.'The Attorney General has commenced an investigation into previous allegations against the Governor, and I have the utmost confidence in her ability to investigate this latest report.She continued: 'At this time no criminal complaint involving this matter has been file by the victim with the Albany Police Department, but Chief Hawkins assured me this evening that APD stands ready to assist any victim who seeks to come forward.'\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0De Blasio also sounded off earlier on Thursday and directly called for Cuomo to resign.\u00a0\u00a0'The latest report, and the fact that we can talk about how many people have been come forward with accusations. It\u2019s not one, it\u2019s not two, it\u2019s not three, it\u2019s not four, it\u2019s not five \u2013 it\u2019s six women who have come forward,' the mayor said.'It\u2019s deeply troubling, the specific allegation that the governor called an employee of his - someone who he had power over - he called them to a place and then sexually assaulted her is absolutely unacceptable.'It's is disgusting to me,' de Blasio continued. 'He can no longer serve as governor. It's as simple as that.'\u00a0De Blasio\u00a0 said his stance was compounded 'so many troubling things' that have come out about Cuomo in recent weeks, including his handling of coronavirus deaths in nursing homes.\u00a0\u00a0'We still don't have the truth about that,' he said of nursing home deaths. 'And their families need and deserve to know the truth.'We know one thing: We know there was a purposeful cover-up and that alone is unacceptable and disqualifying.'These six women have come forward with these powerful and painful stories \u2013 and particularly this most recent report is just disqualifying. He just can\u2019t serve as governor anymore,' de Blasio concluded.\u00a0US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) addressed the controversy during a radio interview on Thursday and called the latest claim against Cuomo 'nauseating' but did not say that he should resign.\u00a0\u00a0Schumer also appeared to accuse Cuomo of withholding pandemic money from New York City in a separate address, while announcing a massive COVID vaccine push in the Big Apple which will see him hand $32 billion allocated for the shots in the COVID relief bill in December straight to Mayor de Blasio.'There's money for the MTA, there's money for our schools, and there is money for New York City,' the New York Senator said as he appeared at de Blasio's press conference.\u00a0\u00a0'With the mayor's guidance and a little bit of prodding, we made sure that money doesn't come through Albany, it goes directly to the city because when Albany gets the money sometimes the city doesn't see all of it.'",

        "full article": "MIAMI (AP) - The NBA has fined Meyers Leonard $50,000, the maximum allowed by league policy, and suspended him from using all Miami Heat facilities and activities for one week in response to his use of an anti-Semitic term. Commissioner Adam Silver, in announcing those sanctions Thursday, also said that he believes Leonard \"is genuinely remorseful\" for using the slur. \"Meyers Leonard\u00b4s comment was inexcusable and hurtful and such an offensive term has no place in the NBA or in our society,\" Silver said. Leonard will also be required by the league to participate in a cultural diversity program. He has already met with representatives from the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish organization that works to stop extremism and delivers anti-bias education. \"We have further communicated to Meyers that derogatory comments like this will not be tolerated and that he will be expected to uphold the core values of our league - equality, tolerance, inclusion and respect - at all times moving forward,\" Silver said. Under the league's collective bargaining agreement, Silver could not exceed $50,000 as a fine for \"any statement having, or that was designed to have, an effect prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of basketball.\" He is permitted to combine the fine with a suspension and, because Leonard is already out for the remainder of the season with an injury, his salary will not be affected.          FILE - Miami Heat forward Meyers Leonard, center, greets his teammates before an NBA basketball game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2020, in Miami. Leonard made an ethnic slur while streaming a video game, a comment that was quickly condemned by the NBA shortly after it learned of the matter Tuesday, March 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, file)  It was not immediately clear how the penalties issued by the NBA would affect Leonard's standing with the team going forward. The Heat, within hours of the video coming out, said Leonard would be away from the team indefinitely. They issued another statement Thursday, several hours after Silver announced the sanctions. \"While we remain hurt and disappointed by what he said, we are encouraged that Meyers has started to take the necessary steps to educate himself about why his comments were so offensive,\" the Heat statement said. \"We will continue to communicate with Meyers and his representatives while he remains away from the team.\" Leonard apologized Tuesday for using the term, insisting he did not know what it meant when he used it one day earlier. The video drew sharp rebukes from league officials, members of other teams, celebrities and even athletes from other sports. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "full article": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) - New Orleans Pelicans guard JJ Redick underwent a non-surgical procedure Thursday to relieve inflammation and soreness in his right heel and will be out of the lineup for at least a week. The Pelicans said Redick will remain away from the team and continue to adhere to the NBA\u00b4s health and safety protocols while receiving follow-up treatment. An update to his status is expected in a week. The 36-year-old Redick has played a reserve role for the Pelicans this season, averaging 8.7 points in 18.6 minutes. While he has been a highly regarded 3-point shooter since entering the NBA, hitting 41.5% from deep throughout his 15-year career, his accuracy has dipped to 36.4% (51 of 140) this season. Redick's absence is expected to result in more playing time for second-year guard Nickiel Alexander-Walker and rookie guard Kira Lewis Jr., the Pelicans' 2020 first-round draft choice. \"We want to see them do a good job defensively. They need to bring us a lot of energy,\" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said Thursday evening, before the Pelicans hosted Minnesota. \"Hopefully, they make good, smart plays, take good shots - not any added pressure on them. They're just going to get opportunities.\" ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

Just like your brothers and sisters, you are a dream come true,' wrote Hilaria, who has since shared numerous shots of Maria Lucia with her 911,000 followers.         Helping hand:\u00a0Taking to her Instagram Story, Hilaria revealed that her and Alec's seven-year-old daughter Carmen lent a helping hand on Thursday morning as she entertained her younger siblings so her mom could 'rest'       Furious speculation about the identity of the couple's anonymous surrogate prompted Alec, 62, to unleash a bitter tirade against Instagram users who questioned the details of Lucia's birth, with the SNL star telling one person to 'shut the f*** up and mind your own business.'But while the couple have kept details of their daughter's birth very much under wraps, Hilaria did hint that they did not rely on sperm or egg donors for Lucia's conception when she described the little girl and her brother Eduardo, six months, as being 'almost like twins' in an Instagram post.In a post shared last Thursday, Hilaria gushed that her family's hearts are 'filled with so much gratitude' over their newest addition.She also admitted that her children 'craved so much to have a little sister,' after miscarrying her unborn daughter in late 2019.'Many of you may remember the loss of their sister at 4 months in the end of 2019. There isn\u2019t a day that goes by where we don\u2019t ache for our daughter. When I found out our baby had died, I told our children that their sister was going to come, just not at that time.\u00a0\u00a0         New additions:\u00a0In a post shared last Thursday, Hilaria gushed that her family's hearts are 'filled with so much gratitude' over their newest addition; Maria Lucia and Eduardo pictured on March 4'Nothing will ever replace her, but two wonderful souls have come into our lives, and we are humbled to know them,' she said of Maria Lucia and Eduardo.She went on to commend her older children's bravery during the family's 'time of tremendous grief,' even admitting that they were braver than her and Alec in terms of facing the future.'To experience and accept life\u2019s ups and downs is challenging, but a reality that all of us have no choice but to receive and process. I have learned that often our children are wiser than we are and their wisdom has guided us.         Rainbow baby:\u00a0Eduardo is considered a 'rainbow baby,' which is a term used to describe the birth of a child after the loss of another due to miscarriage or pregnancy loss; Hilaria pictured in 2020       Speaking specifically about Eduardo, Hilaria described him as 'such a blessing' and that the entire family is 'overwhelmed by how fortunate we are to have him.'Eduardo is considered a 'rainbow baby,' which is a term used to describe the birth of a child after the loss of another due to miscarriage or pregnancy loss.\u00a0\u00a0'We are living each day, bonding, and grateful for all of the very special angels who helped bring Maria into the world,' she wrote, referencing to the couple's unnamed surrogate.         Grateful:\u00a0'We are living each day, bonding, and grateful for all of the very special angels who helped bring Luc\u00eda into the world,' she wrote, referencing to the couple's unnamed surrogate; Hilaria and Alec pictured on March 2'Mar\u00eda Luc\u00eda Victoria and Eduardo Pau Lucas: our babies who bring light into our lives\u2014almost like twins, we love you so much,' concluded Baldwin, who has since earned over 100,000 likes on the heartfelt post.\u00a0While Hilaria only referred to the 'angels' who helped bring Luc\u00eda into the world, a source has confirmed to DailyMail.com that she and Alec used a surrogate.The identity of the surrogate is not known, and a spokesperson for the couple declined to comment on the details of Luc\u00eda's conception and birth.         Surprise!\u00a0Hilaria and Alec surprised their social media followings on Monday, March 1 as they took to Instagram to announce the birth of their sixth child via an unnamed surrogate; Maria Lucia picturedSurrogacy in the US can cost upwards of $100,000, depending on the options used by the parents and their surrogate.If Alec and Hilaria chose to use a 'host' surrogate \u2014 which is when a woman carries an embryo from the mother's egg and the father's sperm \u2014 Hilaria will have had to undergo IVF ahead of the egg retrieval.This could well have been done before she conceived her son Eduardo in late 2019; she and Alec could also have made the decision to freeze eggs, sperm, or fertilized embryos, which could also have been used in the surrogacy.         Twinning:\u00a0But while the couple have kept details of their daughter's birth very much under wraps, Hilaria did hint that they did not rely on sperm or egg donors for Lucia's conception when she described the little girl and her brother Eduardo, six months, as being 'almost like twins' in an Instagram postHowever, if Hilaria and Alec chose to do a 'straight' surrogacy, this will have meant that the surrogate's egg was used, along with the SNL star's sperm.Couples who choose surrogacy also have the option to use a donor egg instead of one from their surrogate.It is likely that Maria was conceived in mid-2020, although her exact age has not yet been shared. Her brother Eduardo, who is six months old, was likely conceived in December 2019, one month after Hilaria suffered her second miscarriage.Instagram followers had plenty of questions when Alec and Hilaria first revealed Lucia's arrival, given that she came so shortly after the birth of baby Eduardo six months ago.Hilaria, who has always heavily documented each of her pregnancies \u2014 and miscarriages \u2014 hadn't said anything about being pregnant again, and of course, the six months between Eduardo and Maria's births were not enough to bring a baby to term.         Confirmed:\u00a0While Hilaria only referred to the 'angels' who helped bring Luc\u00eda into the world, a source has confirmed to DailyMail.com that she and Alec used a surrogate; Hilaria and Alec pictured in 2020       But though Hilaria has been remarkably open about her pregnancies, she and Alec kept their surrogacy journey a secret, and refused to comment on it publicly for several days.Hilaria has only made a return to regularly posting on social media in recent weeks.The influencer, whose given name is Hillary Hayward-Thomas, had come under fire for faking her Spanish heritage, including lying about where she was born and putting on a made-up accent for years.Returning to Instagram, she has kept the comments turned off on her posts, but finally said 'sorry' for the saga on February 5, six weeks after a Twitter thread about her faux European background went viral.Hilaria stopped short of confessing she had misled people about her Spanish roots, and instead doubled down on her previous claims that she was raised 'with two cultures, American and Spanish' and that she feels 'a true sense of belonging to both.''I've spent the last month listening, reflecting, and asking myself how I can learn and grow,' she wrote.         Growing family:\u00a0Hilaria and Alec, who wed in 2012, share Carmen, seven, Rafael, five, Leonardo, four, Romeo, two, and their two newborns'My parents raised my brother and me with two cultures, American and Spanish, and I feel a true sense of belonging to both. The way I've spoken about myself and my deep connection to two cultures could have been better explained \u2014 I should have been more clear and I'm sorry.'I'm proud of the way I was raised, and we're raising our children to share the same love and respect for both.'Being vulnerable and pushing ourselves to learn and grow is what we've built our community on, and I hope to get back to the supportive and kind environment we've built together,' she said.At the end of December, it emerged that Hilaria \u2014 who in the past claimed to have grown up in Majorca and spoke with a Spanish accent \u2014 actually spent her childhood in Beacon Hill, Boston, and went by Hillary.It started with a single tweet on December 21 which read: 'You have to admire Hilaria Baldwin's commitment to her decade long grift where she impersonates a Spanish person'.",

        "title": "Court overturns automatic life sentences for young killers",
        "full article": "SEATTLE (AP) - The Washington state Supreme Court on Thursday overturned the automatic life-without-parole sentences given to two men for murders committed when they were 19 and 20, saying judges must consider the youthfulness of such defendants in sentencing them. The ruling appeared to make Washington the first state to ban mandatory life-without-parole terms for offenders who, while over 18 and legally considered adults, might remain in adolescence from a brain-development standpoint. Lawmakers in a few states - including Illinois, Nebraska and Connecticut - are this year considering bills that would ban life-without-parole sentences for young adults, said Josh Rovner, a senior advocacy associate at The Sentencing Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. Some others, including Florida and California, have already adopted laws that allow youthful adult offenders to be treated with leniency, but they exempt murder defendants. \"It's the right direction for courts and legislatures to go,\" Rovner said. \"Nothing happens on one's 18th birthday. People into their mid-20s have a lot more in common with 15-year-olds than was previously understood.\" Kurtis Monschke and Dwayne Bartholomew were convicted in separate cases decades ago of aggravated first-degree murder, which under state law has historically been punishable only by the death penalty or life without possibility of release. The court has since struck down capital punishment as unconstitutional, leaving an automatic sentence of life without release as the only punishment for adults convicted of the state's most serious offense. The U.S. Supreme Court has already held that juveniles - those under 18 - cannot be given automatic life sentences for murder. But in a 5-4 decision Thursday, the majority of the Washington Supreme Court said the same rationale must apply to 18- to 20-year-olds. Under the ruling, courts in Washington can still sentence such young adult offenders to life without parole, but only after first considering whether their youth weighs in favor of a lesser punishment, the majority said. \"Just as courts must exercise discretion before sentencing a 17-year-old to die in prison, so must they exercise the same discretion when sentencing an 18-, 19-, or 20-year-old,\" Justice Sheryl Gordon McCloud wrote in the lead opinion. It was not immediately clear how many convicted murderers might be entitled to new sentencings under the ruling, but Bartholomew's lawyer, Tim Ford, said it was at most 26. That's how many 18- to 20-year-olds have been convicted of aggravated murder in Washington since 1981, he said; some may since have died or had convictions overturned. Bartholomew was convicted in the killing of Paul Turner II, a Tacoma laundromat attendant, in 1981 after telling his brother he was going to rob the business and leave no witnesses. He was 20 at the time, suffering from depression and other mental health problems, and requested the death penalty when he was arraigned. Ford, who has represented him for nearly 40 years, said Bartholomew's case has gone up to the U.S. Supreme Court four times and the Washington Supreme Court six times. \"He's lived a long time without much hope,\" Ford said. \"Hopefully he'll have something to look forward to other than dying in prison.\" Monschke was 19 in March 2003 when he and two other members of a white supremacist group fatally beat Randall Townsend, a 42-year-old homeless man, also in Tacoma, to earn red shoelaces, a symbol that the wearer had assaulted a member of a minority group. The dissent objected to exempting such young adults from the same automatic punishment that older convicts must receive. The Legislature has decided that 18-year-olds can form contracts, drop out of school, get married, work a hazardous job and serve in the military - and it's not unreasonable for the Legislature to also find that they should face the full consequences of their crimes, Justice Susan Owens wrote. \"Children are different, certainly. But Monschke and Bartholomew were not children when they brutally murdered their victims,\" Owens wrote. She noted that no other state court or legislature had extended such protections to 18- to 20-year-old killers. Although 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds can still be sentenced to die in prison under the ruling, the dissent questioned whether that could realistically occur: How are judges to determine whether a crime represents a defendant\u00b4s \"transient immaturity,\" warranting a lesser sentence, as opposed to \"irreparable corruption,\" warranting life without parole? The ruling vacates the sentences Bartholomew and Monschke received and sends their cases back to Pierce County Superior Court for new sentencing hearings.",

        "full article": "By Anirban Sen and Krystal Hu March 11 (Reuters) - Database software firm Couchbase Inc has registered for a stock market debut that could come in the first half of this year and value it at as much as $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has achieved more than $100 million in annual revenue, one the sources said. The sources requested anonymity because the initial public offering (IPO) filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is confidential and has not yet been made public. Couchbase declined to comment. Couchbase helps corporate customers such as Comcast and eBay manage databases on web and mobile applications through its NoSQL cloud database service. It has thrived as demand for data storage and processing has soared because of remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Founded in 2011, Couchbase has raised $294 million from investors thus far. It last raised $105 million at a valuation of $580 million in May 2020, according to PitchBook data. GPI Capital, North Bridge Venture Partners and Accel are among its backers. The company had eyed an IPO back in 2016, after it raised $30 million. It said at the time it expected that to be its last round before going public. MongoDB, another database company and competitor of Couchbase, went public in 2017 and now commands a $20 billion market capitalization. Snowflake Inc, a cloud-based data-warehousing company, went public last year at a $33 billion valuation, the largest software IPO in history. The U.S. IPO market remains welcoming, with 62 operating companies listed so far this year, according to data provider Refinitiv.

Ardern imposed a seven-day lockdown on the city of 1.7 million after a cluster of cases were detected domestically. The lockdown was eased earlier this month but some restrictions were retained, including limits on large public gatherings under an alert level 2 setting. Ardern said the city will now join the rest of the country in alert level 1, which has no restrictions on gatherings or activity. \"I know everyone in Auckland will be looking forward to a weekend with fewer restrictions,\" Ardern said at a news conference. Swift public health measures combined with aggressive contact tracing, border closures and compulsory quarantine for travellers have been credited with making New Zealand highly successful in keeping the pandemic from spreading. The country has had about 2,000 cases and 26 deaths linked to coronavirus so far. New Zealand started its national rollout of vaccines last month and expects to inoculate its entire population by the end of the year. (Reporting by Praveen Menon; Editing by Sam Holmes)",

Blackstone will lease an additional 80,000 square feet of office space, bringing its total property to about 720,000 square feet.

Blackstone's move to acquire more office space in Manhattan comes as COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out in the city. The company had completed a nearly 150,000 square feet of expansion in the building in 2018. Other notable tenants in the building include global auditor KPMG and the National Football League.

        "full article": "By Siddharth Cavale March 11 (Reuters) - Clorox Co will be able to meet the feverish demand for its disinfectants by summer, when it expects to ship 2 million disinfecting products per day, the company's chief growth officer told Reuters on Thursday. It previously said it would meet consumer demand by the end of 2021. \"I use that 2 million mark to meet the longer term or at least in this fiscal year demand levels that we are seeing,\" said Tony Matta, who joined the company in October. Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, consumers have frantically stocked up on various cleaning supplies, leading to a shortage of Clorox disinfectant wipes among other items, despite the company's efforts to ramp up manufacturing. The company said it will start a second dedicated manufacturing line for wipes at its Atlanta production facility this quarter, after it had to push back the time frame for easing nationwide shortages several times over the past year. Last May, Clorox said it would meet demand for wipes by mid-summer, but then told Reuters it would take at least until 2021. Months later, on a post-earnings call in February, CFO Kevin Jacobsen revised the timeline again to the end of 2021. While the company continues to crank out wipes at its factories 24/7, transportation hurdles that have plagued the consumer packaged industry have hurt Clorox. \"We have incurred significant increases in costs for shipping, but those were costs we were willing to bear to improve the supply situation,\" Matta said. \"By summer, there should be much more normalcy around the kind of supply that consumers would have expected pre-pandemic when they go into stores.\" (Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "full article": "By Leika Kihara TOKYO, March 11 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan may tweak a three-tier deposit system at next week's policy review to exempt a larger portion of reserves from negative interest rates, said sources familiar with its thinking. BOJ Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya has said one of the key goals of the review would be to mitigate the pain that negative rates inflict on financial institutions' profits, and dispel perceptions in the market that further rate cuts were off the table. \"Adjusting the tiered system is one effective way to deal with the side-effects of negative rates,\" one of the sources said, a view echoed by two more sources. This can be done by modifying the composition of the BOJ's three-tier system that imposes -0.1% interest on a small pool of funds, zero interest to another portion and +0.1% interest to the remainder of reserves. The BOJ review may also lay out additional measures it would take to ease banking-sector strains when it actually cuts interest rates, the sources said. Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ applies a 0.1% negative rate on a portion of reserves parked at the bank, and guides 10-year yields around 0% to reflate the economy. The BOJ will conduct a review of its tools including YCC at its March 18-19 meeting to make its stimulus programme more \"sustainable and effective,\" as the coronavirus pandemic prolongs its battle to achieve its 2% inflation target. MIXED MESSAGE At the review, the BOJ will also debate ways to breathe life back to a bond market made dormant by its dominance, though the priority would be to keep borrowing costs stably low to protect a fragile economy, the sources said. Having seen Japanese long-term rates creep up in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields, dovish board members are wary of widening the implicit 40-basis-point band the BOJ sets around its 0% target for 10-year yields. \"Japan is still suffering from the pandemic's blow. The focus now should be to avoid any unwelcome rise in borrowing costs,\" another source said. There is no consensus yet on what changes the BOJ should make to its guidance on its exchange-traded fund (ETF) purchases to become more nimble, the sources said. As a temporary step to battle the pain from COVID-19, the BOJ pledges to buy ETFs at an annual pace of up to 12 trillion yen. It also has a footnote pledging to buy around 6 trillion yen per year when markets are stable. While removing the guidances would allow the BOJ to more flexibly slow purchases when stock prices are booming, central bank policymakers are leaning toward leaving at least one of the two guidelines in place to avoid disturbing markets, they said. At the review, the BOJ for the first time will reveal its findings on how its ETF purchases affected economic and price growth.

He is voicing optimism that the United States will edge toward a semblance of normalcy in the coming months, noting \"there is hope and light of better days ahead if we all do our part.\" But the president is also warning that \"we may have to reinstate restrictions\" if Americans fail to stay vigilant about social distancing and other precautions to help stem the virus.

Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly used xenophobic terms to refer to the virus that originated in China\u00b4s Wuhan province. Some critics say the former president\u00b4s language has stoked the violence against Asian Americans. Biden is addressing the nation on the one-year anniversary of the pandemic. __ 8:05 p.m. President Joe Biden is delivering a somber but optimistic message on the one-year anniversary of the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking from a lectern in a flag-draped backdrop in the East Room of the White House, Biden is reflecting on the worst public health crisis in more than a century. It has killed nearly 530,000 Americans, sickened millions more and ravaged the global economy.

That\u00b4s according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters ahead of Biden\u00b4s address to the nation. The official says the president will also announce plans to double the number of pharmacies participating in the vaccination program, expand mobile operations to vaccinate people in communities that have been hard-hit by the virus, and double the number of federally run mass vaccination centers. There are currently 2,000 active-duty troops supporting vaccination efforts around the country. The official says the White House plans to detail plans on Friday to expand who can administer shots. Dentists, paramedics, physician assistants, veterinarians and medical students will become eligible to administer vaccinations under the new guidance. __ 6:30 p.m. President Joe Biden will use his first prime-time address on Thursday night to announce that he is directing states to make all American adults eligible for a coronavirus vaccine no later than May 1.

        "full article": "DETROIT (AP) - Honda has plans to sell two all-electric SUVs in the U.S. for the 2024 model year, and it soon will offer hybrid gas-electric versions of its top-selling models. The announcements Thursday come as the automaker acknowledges it has work to do to comply with emissions-reduction targets that will be coming from the Biden administration, and a California ban on sales of new internal-combustion vehicles by 2035. Honda of America sales chief Dave Gardner told reporters one of the electric SUVs will be from the Honda brand, while the other will be an Acura. Honda will offer more details later this year, he said. Underpinnings of the new vehicles will come from a partnership with General Motors, while the tops would be made by Honda, he said. As part of Honda's efforts to meet stricter emissions standards, it will reduce emissions from its internal combustion vehicles, Gardner said. Already the company has a hybrid called the Insight, as well as hybrid versions of its Accord midsize car, CR-V small SUV. Gardner said there will probably be one or two additions that he would not identify. He conceded that Honda isn't leading the race to electric vehicles and wouldn't say when it will go all-electric. Honda is focused on being carbon-neutral by 2050 and is aware that President Joe Biden is focused on zero emissions, not just reducing them, he said.          FILE- This Feb. 14, 2019 file photo shows a Honda logo at the 2019 Pittsburgh International Auto Show in Pittsburgh. Honda has plans to sell two all-electric SUVs in the U.S. for the 2024 model year, and it soon will offer hybrid gas-electric versions of its top-selling models. The announcements Thursday, March 11, 2021 come as the automaker acknowledges it has work to do to comply with emissions-reduction targets that will be coming from the Biden administration, and a California ban on sales of new internal-combustion vehicles by 2035. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)  \"We've got to now focus all of our energies in this direction in order to meet timelines,\" he said. Honda has been a dominant passenger-car seller for decades but U.S. buyers are shifting toward SUVs and trucks. And it's also a large manufacturer of internal combustion engines, Gardner said. \"We're really good at a couple of things that seem to be going out of vogue today, so there's no doubt that we have work to start moving quickly in the zero-emission direction,\" he said. Honda is the latest automaker to announce battery-powered vehicles that will be sold in the U.S. market. The consulting firm LMC Automotive says automakers will roll out 22 new electric vehicles this year alone. Last year Americans bought about 260,000 vehicles, only 2% of new vehicle sales. But LMC expects the number to hit more than 680,000 in 2022, passing a million in 2023.",

        "full article": "Rory McIlroy suffered a nightmare start to the defence of his Players Championship title as Sergio Garcia set the pace at TPC Sawgrass. McIlroy\u2019s miserable 79, which included a quadruple bogey on the 18th, equalled the worst opening round in the event by a defending champion, set by Sandy Lyle in 1988. And it was 14 shots worse than playing partner Garcia, who fired two eagles and four birdies in a seven-under-par 65 to enjoy a two-shot lead over American Brian Harman, with Open champion Shane Lowry, Matt Fitzpatrick and Canada\u2019s Corey Conners on four under. In 76 career rounds at TPC Sawgrass, @TheSergioGarcia is 33-under on the 9th hole.He ends on an eagle and leads by two. pic.twitter.com/KXaNTZSRDo\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) March 11, 2021   Garcia, who won the Players Championship in 2008 and lost a play-off in 2015, birdied the 15th and eagled the 16th to reach the turn in 33 and finished his round in style with birdies on the seventh and eighth and an eagle on the ninth. \u201cI\u2019ve always said it, Valderrama and this course are some of my top favourite ones and for some reason it just kind of fits my eye,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI see what I want to do pretty much every hole and then it\u2019s a matter of doing it, but definitely I feel more comfortable and I\u2019ve done well here. So all those things help.\u201d          Sergio Garcia set the pace with an opening 65 in the Arnold Palmer Invitational (AP Photo/John Raoux)  In contrast to Garcia, McIlroy hooked his drive on the 10th \u2013 his opening hole \u2013 into the undergrowth and had to take a penalty drop on his way to a double-bogey six.

That matched the highest nine-hole score of his PGA Tour career \u2013 2011 Masters, final round; 2014 Memorial, second round \u2013 and although birdies on the first and second repaired some of the damage, McIlroy promptly bogeyed the next two holes. A birdie on the fifth was followed by three pars and another bogey on the par-five ninth, where McIlroy was unlucky to find a tricky lie in a greenside bunker but then three-putted from 25 feet. McIlroy had spoken in his pre-tournament press conference of struggling with a \u201ctwo-way miss\u201d and said: \u201cYou\u2019re trying to figure it out but you still know you\u2019re not really sure where the shots are coming from and then it\u2019s hard to at least try to eliminate one side of the golf course, basically.\u201d TPC Sawgrass isn't playing. \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/BU4K0ApL7D\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) March 11, 2021   Fitzpatrick was five under par after 10 holes, but three-putted both par-fives on the back nine for par and also three-putted the dangerous 17th on his way to an opening 68. \u201cIt was a bit hit and miss,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cPlayed really well off the tee, drove the ball well. Not too keen on how I hit my irons and then obviously my short game was fantastic. \u201cPutting wasn\u2019t good today but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m too worried about.\u201d Lowry, who has finished no better than 27th in his five events to date in 2021 and missed the cut in the Arnold Palmer Invitational, was five under par after 17 holes before dropping a shot on the last after being unable to get up and down from a greenside bunker. \"Driver, nine.\"@B_DeChambeau hit driver-9-iron at the par-5 16th.\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) March 11, 2021   Lee Westwood, who finished second to Bryson DeChambeau in the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Sunday, carded a 69 after putting all his experience to good use. \u201cI could see going out this morning that nobody was going to burn it up, you were going to have to play conservatively sometimes, smart golf, and that\u2019s what I tried to do,\u201d the 47-year-old said. \u201cI can use a bit more guile and cunning to get round this kind of golf course.\u201d",

        "title": "In Australia, Japanese start producing hydrogen from brown coal",
        "full article": "By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, March 12 (Reuters) - A Japanese-Australian venture has begun producing hydrogen from brown coal in a A$500 million ($387 million) test project that aims to show liquefied hydrogen can be produced and exported safely to Japan, the project sponsors said on Friday. Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries is running the pilot project with government financial support from both Japan and Australia in the state of Victoria, home to a quarter of the world's known brown coal reserves. The project is key to helping Japan meet its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The world's fifth-largest energy consumer aims to boost its annual hydrogen demand tenfold to 20 million tonnes by 2050, equivalent to about 40% of its current power generation. At the same time, Australia is pushing to become a major hydrogen exporter, eventually rivaling its dominance in global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade, which could potentially give it a greener market for its coal and gas. Brown coal is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low energy content and has long fueled some of Australia's dirtiest power stations, some of which have already shut or are slated for closure. The project is producing hydrogen by reacting coal with oxygen and steam under high heat and pressure in a process that also yields carbon dioxide and other gases. If the project goes commercial, the plan would be to bury the carbon dioxide off the coast of Victoria, KHI has previously said. The Australian and Victoria state governments are running a parallel project to test transporting and injecting carbon dioxide under the seabed. The hydrogen produced in the pilot project will be transported to a port site where it will be liquefied for export. The next big step will be to ship a cargo on the world's first liquefied hydrogen carrier, built by KHI. The voyage has been delayed to mid-year, due to COVID-19 restrictions which have slowed final checks on the tanker. \"The eyes of the world will be on Victoria when shipments of liquefied hydrogen commence in mid-2021,\" Hirofumi Kawazoe, from KHI's Hydrogen Engineering Australia unit, said in a statement. Partners in the Australian side of the project include Japan's Electric Power Development Co (J-Power), Iwatani Corp, Marubeni Corp, Sumitomo Corp and Australia's AGL Energy Ltd , whose mine is supplying the brown coal.

        "full article": "Penrith insist a lack of experience won't be an issue as they try to back up their 2020 heroics despite being the first club in more than a decade to be devoid of any players in their 30s. The Panthers will roll out one of the youngest teams in the competition on Saturday night against North Queensland, with Matt Eisenhuth the oldest player at age 28. The club lost four players aged 30 or older after last year's grand final defeat, including the vastly experienced James Tamou, Josh Mansour and Dean Whare, along with Zane Tetevano. It leaves Isaah Yeo as the club's most experienced player with 148 NRL games, the lowest figure compared to other clubs in this year's competition. They are also the first squad since Melbourne in 2010 to comprise entirely of players who will finish the season in their teens or 20s. But coach Ivan Cleary is adamant that won't be an issue. \"I'm not worried about a lack of leadership to sort things out when we're struggling,\" Cleary said. \"We have that. Sometimes you might like an older person to look to, but when you don't have to you have to get more from everybody else. \"We're in a position now where there isn't a senior hierarchy in our team. \"So we're getting leadership and input from a lot of different people and I think that's a good thing.\" Balancing out the Panthers' youth in Cleary's eyes is also the fact they have played together for so long, with 22 members of their 28-man squad playing under-20s at the club. It made Yeo and Nathan Cleary the natural choices as new co-captains, with the pair having taken charge in preseason training before the roles had been discussed with them. \"Even just going through last year they learned a lot from that,\" Cleary said. \"We're a young team with fresh legs, so with the new rules that might suit us a bit as well. \"A lot of our younger players are going into an exciting period of their career. \"They have a taste of first grade and are in their early to mid-20s, physically in good shape and there is a good connection in the group\" Meanwhile Moses Leota is the other man facing the biggest step up, filling the void of James Tamou and Zane Tetevano up front. While the Panthers were always resigned to losing Tamou, they didn't expect to lose Tetevano who received a big-money offer from Leeds in England. \"Moses has played like 70 or 80 games now. He has been a starter in other grades and has been patiently waiting for this opportunity,\" Cleary said. \"It's an evolution of his career. He and Fish (James Fisher-Harris) are going to form a really good combo.\"",

        "title": "Kansas picks Emmett Jones as interim football coach",
        "full article": "LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) - Emmett Jones was picked as the interim football coach at Kansas on Thursday as the beleaguered school searches for a new athletic director and head football coach following a scandal-plagued week. Jones is entering his third season with the Jayhawks, serving first as the wide receivers coach and most recently as the passing game coordinator. He also has coached at Texas Tech along with several high schools in Texas. \"Emmett's relationship with our football student-athletes is vital as we venture through this time of transition within our football program and athletics department,\" interim athletic director Kurt Watson said in a statement. \"I am confident in his abilities to ensure this program functions at a high level in preparation for the 2021 season.\" Watson also interviewed current defensive coordinator D.J. Eliot, recruiting coordinator and tight ends coach Joshua Eargle and offensive coordinator Mike DeBord, who had been handling day-to-day duties the past week. The mess at Kansas began last week with the release of two reviews by LSU conducted by separate law firms into football coach Les Miles, who had been accused by two women of making sexual advances during his tenure leading the Tigers. Miles was placed on administrative leave before agreeing to a buyout of his contract Monday night. The following day, then-athletic director Jeff Long defended his hiring of Miles - his friend of 30 years dating to their days together at Michigan - and vowed to conduct the search for his replacement. But after significant backlash from fans and prominent donors, Long met with Kansas chancellor Douglas Girod and submitted his resignation. Watson was placed in charge of the athletic department while Girod, with the help of a panel of advisors, searches for the next athletic director. Whomever is hired will then handle the search for the next football coach. Jones is among a few coaches on the staff that will likely be interviewed for the permanent job. He was the head coach at Texas prep powerhouse South Oak Cliff, and he's used his connections in the football hotbed to help lure a series of strong recruiting classes to Kansas. Jones has done it without the benefit of a winning tradition, either, let alone much fan support or facilities that would be deemed average by Division I standards. He also spent time on current Arizona Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury's staff at Texas Tech. \"I am incredibly grateful to Chancellor Girod and Mr. Watson for the opportunity to lead this program during a critical time of change,\" Jones said. \"Since arriving here, I have developed a deep love of this program and university, and it is an honor to be named interim head coach. I will rely on our talented assistant coaches, as well as Ben Iannacchione and the strength and conditioning staff to guide our student-athletes and be there for them on and off the field.\"",

        "title": "Seton Hall into Big East semis, beats St. John's 77-69 in OT",
        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - With its NCAA Tournament hopes likely on the line, Seton Hall dug in and took a huge step toward sticking around in March. Jared Rhoden hit six free throws in overtime to finish with 19 points and a career-high 16 rebounds, and the Pirates got past St. John's 77-69 in the Big East Tournament quarterfinals Thursday to snap an untimely four-game skid. Sandro Mamukelashvili had 20 points and 11 rebounds in 44 minutes for the fifth-seeded Pirates (14-12), who desperately needed a win to boost an NCAA resume that seemed pretty solid not so long ago. \"Obviously, we knew that the tournament was at stake,\" Rhoden said. \"You can\u00b4t think about that tournament. We are trying to win this one first.\" Myles Cale added 16 points and eight boards, and Ike Obiagu blocked seven shots before fouling out as Seton Hall advanced to face Georgetown in the first semifinal Friday night at Madison Square Garden. The eighth-seeded Hoyas upset top seed and No. 14 Villanova 72-71 earlier in the day. \"We feel like this is our second home,\" Pirates coach Kevin Willard said.          Seton Hall's Ike Obiagu (21) and St. John's Josh Roberts (1) vie for the opening tip-off in the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in the quarterfinals of the Big East conference tournament, Thursday, March 11, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)  Big East scoring champ Julian Champagnie led St. John's with 16 points on 7-of-21 shooting and nine rebounds. Rasheem Dunn scored 15 for the fourth-seeded Red Storm (16-11), who went cold after halftime and shot 33% from the floor overall - including 6 of 25 (24%) from 3-point territory. St. John's hasn't reached the Big East semifinals since winning the 2000 tournament - quite a long drought for one of the league's charter members. In a possible NCAA Tournament eliminator, Seton Hall avenged an 81-71 road loss to its Hudson River rivals five days earlier in which the Pirates blew an 18-0 cushion. Now, they could represent the Big East's best chance to get a fourth team in the NCAA field along with Villanova, Creighton and UConn. \"They just wanted it more than us,\" Dunn said. St. John's tied it at 60 on a 3-pointer by Marcellus Earlington with just under two minutes left in regulation. Dunn's two free throws put the Red Storm ahead before Cale pulled the Pirates even on a driving layup with 54 seconds remaining. Champagnie and Mamukelashvili had late looks but couldn't convert. Rhoden's foul shot 30 seconds into overtime put the Pirates ahead to stay. Cale hit a turnaround in the lane to make it 70-64 with 1:45 left and Seton Hall sealed it from the line as St. John's fell to 0-3 in overtime this season. \"I love Jared. How hard he plays is off the charts. Today I saw that Jared who is a dog,\" said Mamukelashvili, co-Big East player of the year. \"Definitely player of the match. So I feel like it\u00b4s just the beginning.\" It was the first Big East Tournament meeting between the schools since 2002, and the first time St. John's played at Madison Square Garden since that bizarre ending to last year\u00b4s event, abruptly called off because of the emerging coronavirus pandemic with the Red Storm leading top-seeded Creighton 38-35 at halftime of the initial quarterfinal - negating the first-half statistics. Normally, the Red Storm schedule high-profile matchups at The Garden, but virus restrictions put all their home games this season on campus at a virtually empty Carnesecca Arena in Queens. Seton Hall was glad to be back at MSG, too, even if there was a different atmosphere than usual. Each school in the quarterfinals was given 100 tickets to Thursday\u00b4s games. \"Man, I walked into this building, I got on the elevator, and I haven\u00b4t felt that good in years,\" Willard said. \"It\u00b4s very emotional for the fact that I love this tournament. I love this league. We\u00b4ve had some great games in this building and to be back was just an absolutely energizing feeling.\" COMING AND GOING Point guard Posh Alexander, the Big East freshman of the year and co-defensive player of the year, returned to the Red Storm after missing two wins with a sprained right thumb. But he wasn't sharp. Alexander came off the bench and played 33 minutes, finishing with three steals and six points on 2-for-8 shooting. St. John's was without 6-foot-10 forward Isaih Moore, which certainly hurt inside. He was required to quarantine due to contact tracing after a member of the program's support staff tested positive for COVID-19. Moore averaged 9.2 points and 4.8 rebounds this season and scored in double digits five of the previous six games. BIG PICTURE Seton Hall: After stopping their losing streak perhaps just in time, the Pirates hope a strong performance at MSG can get them in the NCAAs. Seton Hall is the last program besides Villanova to win the Big East Tournament, taking the 2016 title. St. John's: If not for February lapses against No. 10 seed Butler and last-place DePaul, the Red Storm would be eyeing an at-large NCAA berth right now. But they still have postseason aspirations after a resurgence under second-year coach Mike Anderson. Picked ninth in the Big East preseason coaches' poll, St. John's earned a tournament bye for the first time in six years and its highest seed since No. 3 in 2000. UP NEXT Seton Hall: Split two meetings with Georgetown this season, with the home team winning each one. St. John's: Could be a candidate for a pretty high seed at the NIT in Texas. Pairings for the reduced field of 16 will be announced Sunday night. \"We will continue to play. These guys deserve it,\" Anderson said. \"If given the opportunity, I think it would be beneficial for this team.\" ___ For more AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25          Seton Hall guard Jared Rhoden (14) goes to the basket during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game against St. John's in the quarterfinals of the Big East conference tournament, Thursday, March 11, 2021, in New York.

        "full article": "Babies who are exposed to pollution both before they are born and during their first year of life have a higher risk of allergic rhinitis, scientists have suggested. A study has linked the amount of fine particulate matter that youngsters are exposed to with a risk of allergic rhinitis. Researchers, led by a team of experts from Taiwan, said the associations between pre- and post-natal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and allergic rhinitis were previously not well understood. So they examined data on 140,000 babies born in Taiwan, whether or not they went on to develop allergic rhinitis. This was cross-referenced with their levels of exposure to PM2.5 using a combination of methods including satellite time trend readings, meteorological variables, and land use data. A third of the children \u2013 47,000 \u2013 went on to develop allergic rhinitis.          Scientists have suggested that babies who are exposed to pollution both before they are born and during their first year of life have a higher risk of allergic rhinitis (Yui Mok/PA)  The researchers found a significant association of allergic rhinitis, with rises in\u00a0PM2.5 from 30 gestational weeks until the babies were a year old. They said that each 10 \u00b5g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with 30% higher odds of an allergic rhinitis diagnosis \u2013 the concentration of an air pollutant is measured in micrograms (one-millionth of a gram) per cubic metre of air, or \u00b5g/m3. \u201cOur study provides evidence that both pre-natal and post-natal exposures to PM2.5 are associated with later development of allergic rhinitis,\u201d the authors wrote in the journal Thorax. \u201cThe vulnerable time window may be within late gestation and the first year of life.\u201d Allergic rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mould or flakes of skin from certain animals. When pollen is the allergen the condition is known as hay fever. It is a very common condition, estimated to affect around one in every five people in the UK. Allergic rhinitis typically causes cold-like symptoms, such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose \u2013 which usually start shortly after exposure to an allergen.",

        "title": "Avalanche look to keep up momentum at home vs. Kings",
        "full article": "Troy Grosenick's NHL career was so short he could not even be classified as a journeyman. But the Los Angeles goaltender is the man of the hour after he stepped into his first NHL game in more than six years and led the Kings past Anaheim 5-1 on Wednesday. Grosenick might not get an encore against one of the best offensive teams in the league, but he certainly will serve as inspiration when Los Angeles visits the Colorado Avalanche on Friday night. Grosenick, who was starting in an NHL game for just the third time ever, made 33 saves in a 5-1 win over the Ducks in what was a last-minute start. The Kings' top goaltender, Jonathan Quick, is dealing with an upper-body injury and his backup, Cal Petersen, was a late scratch and is now in COVID-19 health and safety protocol. That left Grosenick, whose last start came for San Jose in November of 2014, as the de facto starter, and he came through. \"Finding out late, honestly, I don't think it really matters too much for me,\" Grosenick after the win. \"It's the same thing. Take the next shot as it comes. If you're prepared for anything, things don't take you by surprise as much.\" Grosenick was assigned to the taxi squad after practice on Thursday. Quick did not practice but is considered day-to-day, which means he could be in net for Los Angeles. If he does play, he will face an Avalanche team that outshot the Coyotes 81-28 in two games but needed overtime on Wednesday night to squeak out a 2-1 win and earn a split. Not even the return of Nathan MacKinnon helped against Arizona goaltender Antti Raanta, and now Colorado will try to keep up the shot totals in two games against Los Angeles. MacKinnon's return after missing three games reduced the number of players on the injured list, but several still remain. J.T. Compher, Bo Byram, Conor Timmins and Dennis Gilbert took part in the optional practice while Cale Makar sat out. None of the players are available for Friday's game, coach Jared Bednar said after practice. Defenseman Erik Johnson and goaltender Pavel Francouz remain on the long-term injured list. Getting MacKinnon back was important for Colorado, which is four games into a nine-game homestand. MacKinnon had 10 shots on goal Wednesday, just four fewer than the Coyotes had as a team all game. His dynamic playmaking ability opens things up for the team. \"He just gives you that spark,\" Bednar said of MacKinnon. \"He's got a pretty good mindset right now, and he continues to drive plays for him and his linemates.\" MacKinnon logged 24 minutes, 44 seconds in his first game in a week, but it was his linemate, Gabriel Landeskog, who got the winner in overtime. \"He's a big part of our offense and a big part of everything we do out there,\" Landeskog said of MacKinnon. \"He's a threat every time he's on the ice. It was a big boost for us coming in as a team. I thought he had a great game; he was dominating every time he was on the ice. It's good to have him back.\" --Field Level Media",

        "title": "With summer in sight, Goldman Sachs starts return-to-office push",
        "full article": "By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall, Arathy S Nair and Yadarisa Shabong NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - On a global town hall meeting held on Zoom, Goldman Sachs Group Inc's CEO on Thursday told the bank's thousands of employees who have been mostly working from home since the start of the pandemic that he hopes to have them working in offices again by this summer. The New York-based investment bank has nearly 40,000 employees around the world and its push to return to offices has been gaining steam internationally. In India, many of the bank's roughly 10,000 employees are returning to offices in Bengaluru and Mumbai from hometowns where they had spent the pandemic. In London, traders, investment bankers and others can get tested for COVID-19 in booths scattered around the building. In New York, Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said the bank owes it to its incoming class of analysts and interns to have them come to work in offices, even if only for part of the summer period, alongside other bank staff. \"Getting them in to the office is best way to get them connected to Goldman Sachs,\" Solomon said during the meeting, which was transcribed and shared with Reuters. \"We understand that until more of us are vaccinated that is going to be a challenge. But based on the current pace of vaccinations, and where we hope to be by the summer, we believe that we are well-positioned and there is a good chance that we can meet that goal.\" Bringing people back, however, presents a range of challenges, even as countries lift many of last year's coronavirus restrictions. Less than 20% of people in the United States have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, leaving many fearful of getting infected at work or on their way to the office. Solomon has continued to work from Goldman's Manhattan headquarters throughout most of the pandemic, a move that some employees say has created pressure to also come to the office. Some say that pressure is reverberating to other regions. More than a dozen employees from the company's Bengaluru-based technology and data center told Reuters that many of those who had left the city for hometowns across India last year were now being told they should return. \"They are asking people to come back but still not forcing people,\" said one employee. \"By mid-April, I think the pressure would be too intense to resist. They are like, 'You should try and come back and see if you like the office vibe and then decide for yourself.'\" \"We continue to work on plans to return our people to office safely, and those plans will vary division by division, country by country, city by city,\" said Goldman spokeswoman Leslie Shribman. \"The safety of our people is our most important priority and we will remain flexible as we monitor evolving government guidelines and the uneven global vaccine rollout.\" CEO Solomon has been clear he thinks working in the office is better for the bank, employees and its customers. \"Our people do their best when they forge close bonds with their colleagues,\" Solomon said. \"We found the best way is to work together in person on a regular basis.\" (Reporting by Elizabeth Dilts Marshall in New York and Arathy S.

        "full article": "By Nivedita Balu and Praveen Paramasivam March 11 (Reuters) - Poshmark Inc on Thursday forecast first-quarter revenue below expectations, saying the online marketplace for secondhand goods struggled with deliveries due to a harsh winter and restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shares of Poshmark, which went public earlier this year, declined 15% in extended trading. They had gained about 42% as of Thursday's close from their initial public offering price. Poshmark has benefited from a growing interest in secondhand online shopping, as the economic fallout of the pandemic that ravaged businesses and led to massive job and pay cuts made people more cautious about their spending. The company said strong demand continued into January, but February sales shrank in certain states due to a severe winter storm that engulfed Texas and nearby states. It also blamed the pandemic for causing delays in delivery of certain orders. \"Some of our customers had their package delayed by a weekend, some had their package arrive four weeks late. So we had a higher than usual cancellation rate,\" Chief Financial Officer Anan Kashyap said on an earnings call. However, Poshmark expects its sales to bounce back as more people venture out and look for new styles for summer. Chief Executive Officer Manish Chandra said searches for summer dresses on the platform surged 200% and those of bathing suits rose 150%. \"That tells me that people are ready to go out,\" he told Reuters in an interview. The California-based company forecast first-quarter revenue between $75.5 million and $77.5 million, implying a growth of 32% to 36% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting revenue of $79.2 million. Net revenue jumped about 27% to $69.3 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, compared with estimates of $68 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

New York used 80 players last season and placed 36 players on injured reserve, tied for the fifth-highest total in the NFL. The Jets' 28 players on IR in 2019 led the league, according to Spotrac. General manager Joe Douglas said the team did a thorough review of its sports performances areas and decided to create a centralized department that will help improve the players' health - and the Jets' overall success. Douglas said the team was impressed by DeWeese's proven track record and vision. \"His focus on speed and power is exactly what we believe we need to help develop and enable Jets players to reach their peak level,\" Douglas said in a statement. \"We are excited to add this new dimension to our organization and bring Dr. DeWeese and his staff into the fold and know the players will find this group to be a tremendous asset to them.\" DeWeese said the newly established program is going to be \"a player-centric model\" that's focused on the individual athlete rather than a training theory. He characterized the approach as \"targeted training.\" The Jets' athletic trainers, strength and conditioning coaches, nutrition staffs and rehabilitation department will all be part of the Athletic Care and Performance Department. \"I want us to be the model for other NFL teams to develop their system by,\" DeWeese said. Nicolini worked with new Jets coach Robert Saleh in San Francisco, where he was the assistant strength and conditioning coach the past two years after a season as a strength and conditioning assistant. Nicolini replaces Justus Galac, who had been with New York for 10 seasons, including the last nine as the head strength and conditioning coach. Ahmad comes to the Jets after serving as the assistant director of athletics and sports performance at Richard Bland College in Virginia since 2019. Sams spent the past two years as a performance science analyst for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals. Sausaman was the director of applied performance at Missouri the past two years, and previously worked with DeWeese at East Tennessee State. ___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "title": "Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal are own worst enemy despite win over Olympiacos",
        "full article": "Mikel Arteta saw Arsenal leave Olympiacos in charge of their Europa League tie following a good win \u2013 but admitted his side were once again their own worst enemy as a defensive error almost proved costly. The Gunners will defend a 3-1 lead at the Emirates Stadium next week and were good value for their round of 16 first leg win in Greece. Martin Odegaard\u2019s first Arsenal goal had them ahead only for another defensive calamity to gift Youssef El-Arabi the equaliser just before the hour. Just like in Saturday\u2019s draw at Burnley, Bernd Leno played the ball short and into the feet of Dani Ceballos \u2013 fresh off the bench \u2013 who was robbed of possession \u2013 allowing El-Arabi to finish past an out-of-position Leno. Arsenal were rocked but recovered well and would hit two goals in six minutes as a Gabriel Magalhaes header and a fine strike from substitute Mohamed Elneny earned a good victory. But it was the ability to shoot themselves in the foot which Arteta addressed after the game. \u201cThey are not far off,\u201d he replied when asked what he would say to people who claimed Arsenal are their own worst enemy at times. \u201cThe goals that we have conceded, or the chances that we have conceded, they are coming from ourselves. \u201cThat\u2019s really positive because the moment we stop it obviously we are going to be even stronger. \u201cBut the reality is we have to stop it immediately because if not the games are all the time there to drop points. \u201cBut it is my responsibility, I make them play the way we want to play. It is just understanding the risk and rewards, when they are, the balls that we have to play and, as I say before, when. \ud83d\uddde Every word from the manager's post-match press conference after our #UEL first leg victory \ud83d\udc47\u2014 Arsenal (@Arsenal) March 11, 2021   \u201cWe have to get better at that, because if not it creates tension, insecurity and it creates belief in the opponent \u2013 and it is unnecessary.\u201d While Arsenal were punished only once for poor defending, Arteta felt his team presented the hosts with two further chances to score and admits that needs to be addressed if they are to improve their current standing. \u201cWe are really pleased with the result, with the goals and the way we played in big moments in the game,\u201d he added. \u201cBut as well, we have to be very clear an honest with ourselves. We gave three goals to the opponent, they took one and at this level they are going to punish you. \u201cIf we want to go to the next level we have to stop doing that and be more ruthless. When you are that dominant and playing that well, just kill the game.\u201d With a north London derby encounter at home to Tottenham on Sunday, Arteta confirmed all of his substitutions during the game were tactical rather than due to injury. Arsenal host their neighbours before welcoming Olympiacos to the Emirates Stadium next Thursday, with the Greek side\u2019s head coach Pedro Martins conceding they are now huge underdogs following the late rally. \u201cThe second goal for Arsenal was decisive,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, the situation now is not favourable for us, but we will go after our chances in the second leg and fight for the best.\u201d",

        "full article": "BOSTON (AP) - An official printing of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson has sold for $85,332, according to Boston-based auction firm. The legislation was designed to secure the right to vote for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in southern states, during the nation\u00b4s tumultuous civil rights era. The 10-page document is signed \"Lyndon B. Johnson, August 6, 1965\" and is an official printing of the law, according to auctioneers RR Auction. The document also bears the signatures of then Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and Speaker of the House John McCormack - fellow Democrats. McCormack was born in Boston and served in the Massachusetts Legislature earlier in his career. A representative of the auction house said the document was purchased by Kenneth Rendell, a historical document dealer based in the suburbs of Boston, who had been waiting decades for the signed copy to reach the marketplace Rendell said in a press release that a New York Republican member of Congress at the time had the GOP print a second copy of the bill, which he carried into the signing ceremony inside his suit jacket and slipped it in front of Johnson, who signed it after he signed the copy that went to the National Archives. Other highlights of the auction included a \"thank you\" letter from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. for his help with Freedom Movement. That sold for $50,000, the auction house said. The auction began on Feb. 19 and concluded March 10.",

        "title": "Sarah Everard case: Met faces watchdog probe over indecent exposure report",
        "full article": "Scotland Yard is facing an investigation by the police watchdog into its handling of an allegation of indecent exposure involving the suspect in the Sarah Everard case. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is to probe whether officers \u201cresponded appropriately\u201d after receiving a report that a man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in south London on February 28 \u2013 three days before the 33-year-old went missing. A serving police officer remains in custody after being detained on suspicion of Ms Everard\u2019s murder and kidnap, and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. Police have been granted more time to question him. The IOPC said in a statement: \u201cThe Independent Office for Police Conduct has started an independent investigation into whether Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) officers responded appropriately to a report of indecent exposure. \u201cThe IOPC\u2019s investigation follows a conduct referral from the MPS in relation to two officers, received last night (Wednesday), which is linked to four other referrals. \u201cThey are all connected to the arrest of a serving MPS officer on suspicion of kidnap, murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure.\u201d The IOPC is also assessing a referral relating to police actions after Ms Everard was reported missing, as well as another in relation to the suspect being taken to hospital. The arrested officer, who is in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was treated for a head injury sustained while in custody on Thursday. He was later discharged and returned to the police station where he is being held. The Met later said he had sustained the injury while alone in his cell and received immediate first aid. Ms Everard vanished while walking home from a friend\u2019s flat in south London on March 3, with her suspected kidnap and murder prompting anger over the safety of women on the UK\u2019s streets. Human remains \u2013 which have not yet been identified \u2013 were found in an area of woodland in Ashford, in Kent, on Wednesday. On Thursday night, Ms Everard\u2019s family released a statement describing her as a \u201cshining example to us all\u201d, and said she had \u201cbrought so much joy to our lives\u201d. They said: \u201cOur beautiful daughter Sarah was taken from us and we are appealing for any information that will help to solve this terrible crime. \u201cSarah was bright and beautiful \u2013 a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. \u201cShe was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. \u201cWe would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah\u2019s friends who are working tirelessly to help.\u201d Ms Everard\u2019s family also thanked the police and pleaded for people with further information to come forward. \u201cNo piece of information is too insignificant,\u201d they said. A woman in her 30s, who was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail to return to a police station on a date in mid-April, police said. The events since Ms Everard\u2019s disappearance have prompted an outpouring of shock and anger as women across the country shared their own experiences of feeling unsafe. A vigil was due to take place at Clapham Common bandstand in south London on Saturday \u2013 but organisers are now seeking legal action after claiming the Metropolitan Police reversed their position on allowing the event to go ahead. A spokeswoman for the Reclaim These Streets group said it plans to bring an appeal to the High Court on Friday challenging the Met\u2019s interpretation of coronavirus restrictions with regard to human rights law. The group said it needed to raise \u00a330,000 by 9am on Friday to cover any legal costs, and set up a crowdfunding site asking the public to make donations. It reached the target shortly before 10.30pm on Thursday, with donations continuing to pour in. London Mayor Sadiq Khan admitted the capital\u2019s streets are not safe for women or girls when speaking to LBC on Thursday, while Home Secretary Priti Patel said \u201cevery woman should feel safe to walk our streets without fear of harassment or violence\u201d. Ms Everard is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton \u2013 a journey which should have taken around 50 minutes. She was last captured on a doorbell camera walking along the A205 Poynders Road towards Tulse Hill at around 9.30pm.",

        "full article": "MANCHESTER, England, March 11 (Reuters) - A stoppage-time header from defender Simon Kjaer earned AC Milan a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in the blockbuster Europa League last-16 first-leg at Old Trafford on Thursday. Kjaer's goal after teenager Amad Diallo had given United the lead leaves the clash of the heavyweights in the balance ahead of the second leg in the San Siro next week. Ajax Amsterdam put one foot in the quarter-finals with a 3-0 win over Swiss side Young Boys -- the goals all coming after the hour mark from Davy Klaassen, Dusan Tadic and Brian Brobbey. Arsenal are in a strong position thanks to a 3-1 win at Olympiakos in which with Martin Odegaard scored his first goal for the club and Gabriel and Mohamed Elneny struck late on. The English side were knocked out last year by Olympiakos but now look set to progress, as do their north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who had a Harry Kane brace to thank for a 2-0 home win over Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb. Europa League regulars Villarreal and their La Liga rivals Granada are also well-placed to reach the last eight. Villarreal beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 away with goals by Pau Torres and Raul Albiol while Granada beat Molde 2-0 with former Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado on target. Manchester United and Milan have clashed 10 times down the years in Europe, winning five apiece, but it was the first time they had locked horns since United claimed a 7-2 aggregate victory in the Champions League last 16 in 2010. STIFFER OPPOSITION Milan lost 4-0 at Old Trafford on that occasion but this time they provided far stiffer opposition. United were fortunate to go in level at the break as Milan's Rafael Leao had a fifth-minute effort ruled out for offside and the visitors had a Franck Kessie strike ruled out for a questionable handball call by VAR. The 18-year-old Diallo, who joined United from Serie A club Atalanta in January, came on as a halftime substitute and claimed his first goal for the English side five minutes later. Picked out by a lofted ball from Bruno Fernandes he found the net with a smart back-header over Milan keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Dan James missed a sitter for United when he turned a cross by Mason Greenwood wide but Milan got the reward they deserved in stoppage time when Kjaer headed Rade Krunic's corner past Dean Henderson. It was the first goal United had conceded in 503 minutes in all competitions and means they will have their work cut out in next week's second leg. \"We're very disappointed to concede with one of the last kicks of the game,\" United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said. \"That makes it harder of course, but it was always going to be down to the second game there anyway.\" Newly crowned Scottish champions Rangers fought back to earn a 1-1 draw at Slavia Prague. Romanian Nicolae Stanciu fired the Czech side ahead in the sixth minute with a superb strike but Steven Gerrard's side drew level through Filip Helander. In the night's other tie, AS Roma enjoyed a 3-0 home win over Shakhtar Donetsk with goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Stephan El Shaarawy and Gianluca Mancini.

        "title": "MATCHDAY: Aston Villa at struggling Newcastle",
        "full article": "A look at what\u00b4s happening in European soccer on Friday: ENGLAND Aston Villa plays away at Newcastle knowing a victory would lift the team above defending champion Liverpool to eighth place in the Premier League ahead of the weekend\u00b4s remaining fixtures. However, Villa\u00b4s results have been patchy recently, winning four and losing four of its last 10 Premier League matches. One of the reasons for Villa\u00b4s inconsistency recently has been the absence of captain Jack Grealish. The 25-year-old attacker has recovered from a leg injury but will miss a fifth league game due to illness. There was some positive news on injuries, though, as winger Anwar El Ghazi will be fit to travel after missing a 0-0 draw with Wolverhampton with a bruised toe while defender Matty Cash will also be back in contention after missing the last four games with a hamstring injury. Villa retained its topflight status at the end of last season by a single point while Newcastle finished comfortably in 13th place, but roles have been reversed this year. Newcastle saw its advantage over the bottom three dwindle to a single point last weekend. SPAIN Levante hosts Valencia in a derby with both rivals wedged in the middle of the Spanish league table. Levante is still aiming to rebound from an extra-time loss to Athletic Bilbao last week that cost it a place in the final of the Copa del Rey. It followed that up with a loss to Real Sociedad in the league. Valencia is winless in its last four games away from home. ITALY Atalanta is hoping to move back into the top four in Serie A with a win at home to unpredictable Spezia. The visitors are just six points above the relegation zone and have only picked up two points from four matches but they managed to beat AC Milan recently and also drew against Atalanta earlier in the season. Atalanta could rest some players ahead of next week\u00b4s trip to Real Madrid, where it needs to overturn a 1-0 deficit. Lazio is also involved in the Champions League, although it will need something of a miracle to overturn a 4-1 deficit at holder Bayern Munich. Lazio has also lost four three of its past four Serie A matches and will be hoping to reverse the slide against bottom club Crotone. Crotone is seven points from safety but snapped a seven-match losing streak against Torino last weekend, in new coach Serse Cosmi\u00b4s first win in charge. GERMANY Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach has a point to prove at Augsburg, where it hopes to make up lost ground in the Bundesliga\u00b4s race for European qualification places. Gladbach has lost five games in a row across all competitions since the club announced coach Marco Rose is leaving to join Borussia Dortmund next season. Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl has been forced to defend the coach amid calls from fans to fire him before the losing run continues. Gladbach has dropped to 10th, six points behind Dortmund in the last place for Europa League qualification. Eight rounds of games remain after this weekend\u00b4s matches. FRANCE Looking for a first league title since 2008, Lyon can move to the top of the French standings with a win at Reims. With just 10 games remaining, the seven-time champions are just three points behind leader Lille in a very tight race also involving second-placed PSG and Monaco. With the return of forward Tino Kadewere in the group, Lyon should be at full strength. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "full article": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - MaCio Teague scored 24 points, Davion Mitchell added 23 and second-ranked Baylor held on to beat Kansas State 74-68 on Thursday and avoid what would have been one of the biggest upsets in the history of the Big 12 Tournament. The top-seeded Bears (22-1) rolled into T-Mobile Arena after their first regular-season conference title since 1950 and with a No. 1 seed in next week\u00b4s NCAA Tournament nearly locked up. Yet the Wildcats (9-20), who lost their two regular-season games to Baylor by an average of 40 points, never allowed the high-powered Bears to slip away. They trailed by four points with just over a minute to go, but Jared Butler made a couple free throws to seal the win. It sent Baylor into a semifinal matchup with No. 12 Oklahoma State on Friday night. NO. 9 OHIO STATE 79, MINNESOTA 75 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Duane Washington Jr. and Justice Sueing each scored 16 points and No. 9 Ohio State fended off Minnesota\u00b4s late charge to win in the Big Ten Tournament.          Baylor's MaCio Teague gathers his teammates for a meeting during the second half of an NCAA college basketball gameagainst Kansas State in the second round of the Big 12 Conference tournament in Kansas City, Mo., Thursday, March 11, 2021. Baylor won 74-68. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The Buckeyes (19-8) snapped a four-game losing streak and advanced to face No. 21 Purdue in Friday\u00b4s quarterfinals. Marcus Carr scored 24 points and Jamal Mashburn Jr. finished with 18 to lead Minnesota (14-15), which lost for the eighth time in nine games. Ohio State struggled to put this one away late - despite having a seemingly safe 70-56 lead with 3:24 to go. The Gophers cut the deficit to 75-74 on Carr\u00b4s 3-pointer with 13.3 seconds to go before Ohio State finally sealed it at the free-throw line. NO. 12 OKLAHOMA STATE 72, NO. 10 WEST VIRGINIA 69 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Avery Johnson III hit the go-ahead bucket for Oklahoma State with less than a minute to go, and Sean McNeil\u00b4s tying 3-pointer came a split-second after the final buzzer, allowing the Cowboys to escape West Virginia in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals. Anderson and Big 12 player of the year Cade Cunningham had 17 points apiece for the fifth-seeded Cowboys (19-7), who have won seven of their last eight games - including two against the Mountaineers - with the only loss to No. 2 Baylor. Isaac Likekele and Bryce Williams each added 10 points to help the Cowboys reach the semifinal round. Miles McBride and Taz Sherman finished with 19 points apiece for West Virginia (19-8). Derek Culver added 11 points and nine boards. NO. 11 KANSAS 69, NO. 25 OKLAHOMA 62 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Ochai Agbaji scored a career-high 26 points, Marcus Garrett added 17, and Kansas held on after blowing most of a 20-point halftime lead to beat Oklahoma in the quarterfinals of the Big 12 Tournament. Mitch Lightfoot added 11 points for the No. 2 seed Jayhawks (20-8), who played without big man David McCormack and backup forward Tristan Enaruna, both of whom were caught up in COVID-19 protocols leading up to the tournament. The seventh-seeded Sooners (15-10) trailed 35-15 at halftime, but they managed to close within 62-59 with 3 1/2 minutes to go when Elijah Harkless followed a miss by Austin Reaves with a bucket of his own. But the Sooners didn\u00b4t get another field goal to go until the final minute. Kansas will play No. 13 Texas in the semifinals Friday night. NO. 13 TEXAS 67, NO. 20 TEXAS TECH 66 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Matt Coleman scored 19 points, including the go-ahead free throws with 1.8 seconds left, and Texas rallied in the closing minutes to beat Texas Tech in the quarterfinals of the Big 12 Tournament. Jase Febres finished with 15 points, Andrew Jones added 11, and Jericho Sims and Kai Jones had 10 apiece for the Longhorns (18-7). The sixth-seeded Red Raiders led 66-61 before baskets by Kai Jones and Coleman got third-seeded Texas within a point with less than a minute to go. In the final seconds, coach Shaka Smart drew up a play for Coleman, who drove to the basket, was fouled and calmly hit both free throws. Terrence Shannon Jr. finished with 18 points to lead the Red Raiders (17-10). GEORGETOWN 72, NO. 14 VILLANOVA 71 NEW YORK (AP) - Dante Harris made two free throws with 4.7 seconds left to cap a perfect game from the line for Georgetown, and the Hoyas upset Villanova to reach the Big East Tournament semifinals. The eighth-seeded Hoyas (11-12) will play fifth-seeded Seton Hall on Friday night at Madison Square Garden. Georgetown is in the conference semifinals for the first time since 2015. Harris led the way with 18 points and drew a foul on Jeremiah Robinson-Earl driving to the basket with 4.7 seconds to go and the Hoyas down one. Harris rattled in the first and swished the second to make Georgetown 23 of 23 from the line, the first time a team has shot 100% on at least 20 attempts in the Big East Tournament. The top-seeded Wildcats (16-6), playing without injured star Collin Gillespie, had won three straight Big East Tournament titles. Robinson-Earl led the Wildcats with 26 points and Jermaine Samuels added 20. NO. 16 VIRGINIA 72, SYRACUSE 69 GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) - Reece Beekman hit a 3-pointer as time expired to help Virginia edge Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament. Beekman hadn\u00b4t hit a shot all day but buried a 3 from the right wing off a feed from Kihei Clark as the horn sounded. That allowed the top-seeded Cavaliers (18-6) to grind out a win after trailing by 11 in the first half while struggling to slow Syracuse\u00b4s Buddy Boeheim. Sam Hauser scored 21 points to lead Virginia, which will face Georgia Tech in Friday's semifinals. Boeheim finished with a career-high 31 points for the eighth-seeded Orange (16-9), a day after he scored 27 points in Syracuse\u00b4s tournament opener. NO. 17 CREIGHTON 87, BUTLER 56 NEW YORK (AP) - With coach Greg McDermott back on the bench after a one-game suspension, Creighton cruised past Butler and into the semifinals of the Big East Tournament. The second-seeded Bluejays (19-7) advanced to face Connecticut or DePaul on Friday night at Madison Square Garden. Creighton is in the semifinals for the third time since joining the conference in 2013 and first time since 2017. Damien Jefferson scored 11 points in the first eight minutes and Marcus Zegarowski led the Bluejays with 18. Bryce Nze had 21 points to lead No. 10 seed Butler (10-15). NO. 19 SAN DIEGO STATE 69, WYOMING 66 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Terrell Gomez scored 20 points and San Diego State beat Wyoming to advance to the Mountain West Conference Tournament semifinals. The Cowboys had a chance to tie it at the buzzer, but Marcus Williams\u00b4 long 3-pointer missed badly. Jordan Schakel and Trey Pulliam each scored 15 points for the Aztecs (21-4), who will play Nevada on Friday. Xavier DuSell led Wyoming (14-11) with 21 points. Williams and Hunter Maldonado each scored 12. NORTH CAROLINA 81, NO. 22 VIRGINIA TECH 73 GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) - Armando Bacot had 17 points and 13 rebounds while sparking a second-half surge that helped North Carolina beat Virginia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament quarterfinals. Freshman RJ Davis added 14 of his season-high 19 points after halftime for the sixth-seeded Tar Heels, including three of his four 3-pointers to set up a matchup with No. 15 Florida State. Bacot scored 13 of his points after halftime, including a run of 10 in a row as UNC (18-9) used a 11-2 run to break a 49-all tie. Justyn Mutts scored a season-high 24 points on 10-for-16 shooting for the third-seeded Hokies (15-6), whose last two regular-season games were canceled due to contact tracing. No. 23 COLORADO 61, CALIFORNIA 58 LAS VEGAS (AP) - Evan Battey scored 15 points and Colorado shook off a sluggish start to beat California in the Pac-12 Tournament quarterfinals. The Buffaloes and Bears had a long wait after the two previous games went through three overtimes, setting up a true Pac-12 after dark game. They played like it was Pac-12 shooting after dark once the game started, combining to miss 36 shots in the first half. Colorado (25-7) finally got a few to fall, using a 15-3 run to go up 11, and withstood a late Cal run to close out a surprisingly difficult win over the tournament\u00b4s No. 11 seed. Cal (9-20) went on an 8-0 run keyed by Matt Bradley to get back in it and pulled within 61-58 on Jalen Celestine\u00b4s three-point play with 41 seconds left. Makale Foreman had a good look to tie it, but his 3-pointer rimmed out with 2 seconds left. NO. 24 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 91, UTAH 85, 2OT LAS VEGAS (AP) - Evan Mobley scored 13 of his 26 points in the two overtimes and Southern California outlasted scrappy Utah in the Pac-12 quarterfinals. The second-seeded Trojans (22-6) had a hard time shaking the seventh-seeded Utes in a game filled with methodical possessions. Utah (12-13) hung around after trailing by 10 midway through the second half and rallied to tie the game on Ian Martinez\u00b4s two free throws with 2.3 seconds left in regulation. The Utes tied it again in the first overtime on Alfonzo Plummer\u00b4s 3-pointer with 24 seconds left. Mobley had five points in the first overtime and eight more in the second to send the Trojans in to Friday\u00b4s semifinals. Timmy Allen had 20 points and Martinez 16 to lead the Utes. ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",

        "title": "Vigil organisers to launch legal challenge over alleged police U-turn",
        "full article": "Organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard are seeking legal action after claiming the Metropolitan Police reversed its position on allowing the event to go ahead. A spokeswoman for the Reclaim These Streets group said it will seek an order in the High Court on Friday challenging the Metropolitan Police\u2019s interpretation of coronavirus legislation when read together with human rights law. The vigil, due to take place at Clapham Common bandstand in south London on Saturday, was organised after Ms Everard\u2019s suspected kidnap and murder sparked anger over the safety of women on the UK\u2019s streets. In statement tweeted on Thursday evening, Reclaim These Streets said it was \u201corganised by a group of women who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community\u201d. \u201cOur plan was to hold a short gathering, centred around a minute of silence to remember Sarah Everard and all women lost to violence,\u201d the statement added. Under the current Covid-19 lockdown in England, people are largely required to stay at home and can only gather in larger groups for limited reasons, such as funerals or for education. Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of \u00a310,000 for someone holding a gathering of over 30 people. Reclaim These Streets said it was \u201calways aware of the challenges of organising a Covid-secure vigil, but safety has been a top priority from the beginning\u201d. It claimed: \u201cWhen we initially proposed the event, we proactively reached out to Lambeth Council and Metropolitan Police to ensure that the event could safely and legally take place. \u201cAfter initially receiving a positive response, we continued to plan and promote the event and continued to update the Council and Police. \u201cThe Metropolitan Police said that they were \u2018trying to navigate a way through\u2019 and that they were \u2018currently developing a local policing plan\u2019 to allow the vigil to take place and to enable them to \u2018develop an appropriate and proportionate local response\u2019 to the event. \u201cSince this statement, the Metropolitan Police have reversed their position and stated that the vigil would be unlawful and that, as organisers, we could face tens of thousands of pounds in fines and criminal prosecution under the Serious Crimes Act.\u201d The group said it had taken advice from human rights lawyers who it claimed viewed that \u201cthe Metropolitan Police are wrong in their interpretation of the law and that socially distant, outdoor gathering of this kind are allowed under the current lockdown regulations, when read together with the Human Rights Act\u201d. Lawyers have written to the force challenging their interpretation of coronavirus legislation, the Reclaim These Streets statement added. Speaking on behalf of the group, Caitlin Prowle said if it was to lose its legal challenge then it would have to cancel the event and explore other options. She added: \u201cIf we lose we will be facing quite significant fines and we will also be putting anyone who wants to come along at risk of fines as well.\u201d Ms Prowle said that during planning for the vigil the Metropolitan Police\u2019s \u201ctone changed quite quickly\u201d and that the group\u2019s claims on its alleged reversed position relate to correspondence with the force. Reclaim These Streets has launched an online fundraiser to raise \u00a330,000 that it said it might need to cover potential legal costs. This target was stretched to \u00a340,000 as it was rapidly exceeded on Thursday night. If the group wins its legal challenge it said it would donate the money to a women\u2019s charity. Its statement concluded: \u201cWe\u2019ve all been following the tragic case of Sarah Everard over the last week. \u201cThis is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day. It said by \u201cforcing us to cancel\u201d the vigil, the police would be \u201csilencing thousands of women like us who want to honour Sarah\u2019s memory and stand up for our right to feel safe on our streets\u201d. The Met has been approached for comment.",

        "full article": "Jose Mourinho expects Harry Kane to be fit for Sunday\u2019s north London derby against Arsenal after he picked up a knock in Tottenham\u2019s 2-0 Europa League win over Dinamo Zagreb. The England captain continued his sensational season with both goals in the last-16 first-leg win against the Croatian side, but was taken off in the final 10 minutes and was later seen on the touchline with ice on his knee. He looked to be moving better at the full-time whistle and Mourinho says it would take something special to keep Kane out of a game he loves playing in. Asked whether he will be fit for Sunday, Mourinho said: \u201cI hope so, I believe so. It is a big match, only big problems stop him to be there. Let\u2019s see the reaction tomorrow but I am sure he will be fine.\u201d It was another impressive display from Kane, who took his tally to 26 goals for the campaign, having also added 16 assists and the Dinamo Zagreb coach Zoran Mamic called him a \u201cmaster of football\u201d. Mourinho agreed with that assessment. Mourinho said: \u201cHe is. He is very intelligent. His football is an intelligent football. \u201cSome strikers score lots of goals and that is the most important thing in football for a striker, which he does, but apart from that he understands every tip we give him, in terms of his positioning, movement, he understands the game very well. \u201cHe feels the spaces, he looks around to see where other players are and he can affect the game. He is really a very good player.\u201d Kane was the difference for Spurs in a match they dominated but struggled to create a raft of chances against a compact team, who arrived in north London on the back of eight successive wins. He opened the scoring in the 25th minute when he converted a rebound from Erik Lamela\u2019s shot which hit the post and then punished some poor defending with a clinical finish with 20 minutes remaining to put Spurs in control. Mourinho was happy with the performance, but says their work is not yet done ahead of the second leg in Zagreb next week. \u201cIt was not a bad performance at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was positive. Maybe we could play with a little bit more intensity. Because we had let\u2019s say a fresh team, apart from 3-4 guys, lots of the players were totally fresh, but it\u2019s not also easy to play against a physical team and a team that defends well like they did. \u201cThey defended well. When the result was 1-0 in the second half they tried to keep that result so they still stayed in a low block and defended well. \u201cSo it\u2019s not easy. The result could be a little bit bigger. A third goal would have come and fit very well in the reality of the game, but it is what it is. \u201cIt\u2019s still open. We have to go there and play a serious match because 2-0 we are not yet in the quarter-finals.\u201d Mamic said his side have not given up hope of a comeback. \u201cKane showed us again what a master of football he is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second goal, the way he calmed the situation and then his shot was impossible to defend. \u201cThere I always hope in football, anything is possible, we must believe. You enter every game to win and you cannot start a game thinking we are definitely going to lose. I think we are going to have more chances in Zagreb.\u201d",

        "title": "Senators still on hunt for first victory vs. Oilers",
        "full article": "The Ottawa Senators are hoping seven is lucky when they hit the ice for Friday's road clash with the Edmonton Oilers. The first six meetings between the teams have been a disaster for the Senators, with their 7-1 loss at Edmonton on Wednesday the latest embarrassment in this disastrous season. The Oilers have won all six clashes between the clubs, four of them at Edmonton, but the most recent was a debacle of monumental proportion for a Senators team now looking for revenge. \"We can't let that happen,\" said defenseman Mike Reilly. \"That's something that happened earlier in the year, in the same building. We feel like we were completely past that, not having those games (anymore) and it happened (again). It's not acceptable one bit. It's on every single guy. It's not the coaches, at all. It's on us.\" The Oilers took a 4-0 lead by the end of the first period on Wednesday and extended it to a full seven before a third-period goal by Ottawa's Evgenii Dadonov killed the shutout bid. \"That's on me when the team is not ready to play,\" Ottawa coach D.J. Smith said. \"I'm the coach and I'm the leader. I have to do a better job. Things like (Wednesday) happen, and obviously I didn't turn on enough light bulbs to get them ready for the game.\" The Senators have surrendered five or more goals in 10 games this season and have allowed seven or more in five outings. Ottawa did receive some good news. Forward Colin White appeared to suffer a serious injury on Wednesday, but is listed as day-to-day although he won't play this game. Forward Ryan Dzingel, who also left the game, is a game-time decision. For the Oilers, a three-game winning streak has put in the rearview mirror their struggles against the Toronto Maple Leafs a couple of weeks ago -- three straight losses by a 13-1 combined score. The turnaround has Edmonton at 17-11-0 at the midway point of the season and full of confidence. \"Sometimes when you get punched in the mouth, you have to come back, get up off the mat and start working again, and that's what we've done,\" coach Dave Tippett said. \"It's been good for our team. We recognized some things we need to do a lot better.\" Leading the way, to no surprise, has been the dynamic duo of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who have been dominant ever since struggling against Toronto. \"It's our job as the leadership group and collectively as a team to find our way out of it and go in the right direction,\" Draisaitl said. \"I thought our team did a great job of sticking with that in the Calgary game, and we're back to 3-0 in the last three, so huge props to our group.\" In their last three games, McDavid has netted two goals and six assists, while Draisaitl -- who had a five-point outing on Wednesday -- has compiled four goals and three helpers. They have feasted on the Senators, combining for 28 points, with Draisaitl collecting six goals and nine assists and McDavid racking up two goals and 11 assists in those six clashes. \"Connor and Leon are both incredible players and obviously world-class players,\" defenseman Tyson Barrie said. \"They are quite a bit different, too. They go about it in different ways. Leon, the way he thinks the game and the way he passes the puck on his forehand, backhand, slows the game down and finds guys with speed, it's pretty incredible. He's a great guy and I'm really grateful to get out with those two on a nightly basis.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Zurich private bank Rahn+Bodmer will pay $22 million to settle U.S. criminal charges it helped American taxpayers who were exiting accounts at UBS and other Swiss banks and hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in offshore accounts. The agreement is the latest in the U.S. Department of Justice's long-running pursuit of Swiss banks for helping people evade U.S. taxes, resulting in billions of dollars in settlements, fines and restitution from financial institutions in Switzerland including UBS and Credit Suisse. U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday that the Swiss bank admitted wrongdoing including helping clients defraud the Internal Revenue Service and entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement after being accused of conspiring to help clients evade U.S. taxes and file false tax returns. Zurich's oldest private bank, Rahn+Bodmer was founded in 1750 and last year had 13.6 billion Swiss francs ($14.71 billion) of client assets under management. It will cooperate with the Justice Department's crackdown on offshore tax evasion. Neither Rahn+Bodmer nor its New York-based lawyer responded to requests for comment. Rahn+Bodmer admitted to having from 2004 to 2012 held undeclared accounts on behalf of approximately 340 U.S. taxpayers who together evaded about $16.4 million of U.S. taxes in that period, the Justice Department said. Its alleged misconduct included opening accounts under pseudonyms or \"sham\" foundations in Liechtenstein and Panama, and for clients who were exiting UBS Group AG and other Swiss banks. Rahn+Bodmer agreed to pay a $7.4 million fine, forfeit $9.7 million of fees, and make $4.9 million of restitution. UBS agreed in 2009 to pay a $780 million penalty to settle U.S. charges it helped wealthy U.S. clients evade taxes, and handed over names and data on thousands of client accounts, helping kick off numerous settlements involving other Swiss financial institutions.

        "full article": "Australian-made hydrogen will be exported to Japan under a world-first trial taking a big step forward for the emerging industry. The Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain projects will see hydrogen made from coal in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. This is not the 'green' hydrogen environmentalists have been calling for, but the project will aim to store its carbon dioxide emissions so they are not in the atmosphere. The companies behind the project - a mix of Japanese and Australian businesses - say the emissions will be stored under rocks 1.5 kilometres beneath the Bass Strait. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor and the Ambassador of Japan Shingo Yamagami will be among officials visiting the site on Friday to celebrate the start of the project. \"This project is a great example of how regional Australia can play a key role in developing Australia's hydrogen future on the world stage, with investment and job opportunities to flow through to communities,\" Mr Taylor said in a statement. The project will export liquefied hydrogen to Kobe in Japan. Experts are pinning their hopes on the industry as a future fuel, estimating it will create more than 8000 jobs in Australia and $11 billion a year in GDP by 2050. It's hoped coal workers will be able to transition their skills to hydrogen. The federal and Victorian governments have both invested $50 million to the project, which has a $500 million bill. Hydrogen produces water vapour and heat when burned, and is close to a zero-emissions fuel when produced from water using renewable electricity, or from coal or methane combined with carbon capture and storage. NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean has on Friday announced the Hunter region will be home to one of the state's first green hydrogen hubs. Mr Kean says the Hunter area is suitable as it already has energy infrastructure, water sources, ports and logistics capabilities. \"By investing in hydrogen hubs we will kick-start jobs and infrastructure opportunities in NSW while simultaneously contributing to our net zero by 2050 goal,\" he said. The Illawarra, south of Sydney, will be another hydrogen hub for NSW. The state government is putting $70 million into setting up the hubs.",

        "full article": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - A man accused of drowning two of his sons and trying to kill his ex-wife by driving them off a Los Angeles wharf to collect an insurance payout was sentenced Thursday to 212 years in federal prison for fraud. Ali F. Elmezayen, 45, received the maximum sentence from a judge who denounced an \"evil and diabolical scheme.\" \"He is the ultimate phony and a skillful liar ... and is nothing more than a greedy and brutal killer,\" U.S. District Judge John R. Walter said. \"The only regret that the defendant has is that he got caught.\" The judge also ordered Elmezayen to pay $261,751 in restitution to the insurance companies. A federal jury convicted him of mail fraud, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering in 2019. After the car plunged into the water in 2015, Elmezayen was charged in the federal fraud case and accused by local prosecutors of murder, attempted murder and a special circumstance that the killings were for financial gain. The murder charges were arranged to be prosecuted after the federal case.          FILE - In this April 9, 2015, file photo, divers emerge from the water as debris believed to be from a car floats to the surface where a car went off a pier and into the water in Los Angeles' San Pedro harbor district. A man accused of drowning two of his sons and trying to kill his ex-wife by driving them off a Los Angeles wharf to collect an insurance payout was sentenced Thursday, March 11, 2021, to 212 years in prison for fraud. (Steve McCrank/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP, File)  \"A bench warrant has been issued and our office is evaluating the next step,\" Greg Risling, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney, said in an email to The Associated Press. Elmezayen, of suburban Hawthorne, bought more than $3 million worth of life and accidental death policies on himself and his family from eight insurance companies between July 2012 and March 2013, according to federal prosecutors. He paid more than $6,000 a year in premiums for the policies while reporting income of less than $30,000 a year on his tax returns, prosecutors said, noting that he began buying the policies the same year he exited a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Prosecutors said Elmezayen repeatedly called the companies to verify the policies were active and that they would pay benefits if his ex-wife died in an accident as well as confirm with at least two insurers that they would not investigate claims made two years after the purchases. Elmezayen drove a car carrying his ex-wife and two youngest children off a commercial fishermen\u00b4s wharf in the San Pedro area of the Port of Los Angeles on April 9, 2015. It was 12 days after the two-year contestability period on the last of his insurance policies expired, prosecutors said. Elmezayen got out through the open driver\u00b4s side window and his ex-wife, who could not swim, was rescued when she got out and a fisherman threw her a flotation device. The boys, ages 8 and 13, were strapped in and could not escape the vehicle. Their third son was away at camp at the time. Elmezayen received more than $260,000 in insurance proceeds from two companies on policies he had taken out on the children\u00b4s lives and used some of the money to buy real estate in Egypt and a boat, prosecutors said.",

\u00a36.8m [Selected by 1.9%]While there has been frustration aplenty surrounding the blanks of Dominic Calvert-Lewin - it is not just me grumbling here - there has been plenty to cheer watching Sigurdsson.\u00a0The Iceland international has produced attacking returns in three of his last four league games - only failing to provide a goal or an assist in the loss to Chelsea last time out.He is not aa guaranteed starter under Carlo Ancelotti and while that is a worry he is showing he can influence the game at any time.It was Sigurdsson's crucial delivery for the opening goal at West Brom that set Everton on their way at the Hawthorns.\u00a0His total of 87 points so far is only eight shy of what he managed in 2019-20 and with an ownership of just 1.9 per cent, Sigurdsson is a very attractive differential ahead of a home fixture with Burnley.\u00a0Matt Targett (Aston Villa) - \u00a35m [Selected by 14.3%]There are a lot of routes into Aston Villa's defence but it is Targett that has now become the must-have ahead of Tyrone Mings and Ezri Konsa.Four clean sheets in the last six games is very enticing at a stage of the season where more and more stalemate's are cropping up.Dean Smith's side have the third-meanest defence in the Premier League this season.Only Manchester City and Manchester United have conceded less than Villa.\u00a0A trip to the north east to face a blunted Newcastle side feels like a fixture ready-made for a Targett shut-out.\u00a0\u00a0         Matt Targett has proven to be Aston Villa's most popular defender among Fantasy managers         Mason Mount has continued his fine form since Thomas Tuchel succeeded Frank LampardMason Mount (Chelsea) - \u00a37m [Selected by 13.9%]Any fears Mount would be cast aside under Tuchel have quickly evaporated.\u00a0Two double digit returns in the last four games bode well as Chelsea head to a Leeds side that have shown they are not all that obsessed with clean sheets this season.\u00a0The fact he was a substitute against Everton suggests he will get a nod from the start at Elland Road -

        "title": "Mexico to evaluate need for tax reform after midterm elections",
        "full article": "By Abraham Gonzalez MEXICO CITY, March 11 (Reuters) - Mexico will this year evaluate the need for a tax reform, Finance Minister Arturo Herrera told Reuters on Thursday, saying the federal government was talking to states about their fiscal requirements to see if conditions exist for such a shake-up. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador campaigned on a promise of no tax hikes or new taxes in the first three years of his government, a period which ends in December. Herrera said the issue would be taken up after midterm elections in June. Mexico's tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is the lowest in the 37-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \"We are already entering an electoral process that will be highly competitive ... and that will probably prevent us from having an open discussion about this process in the coming months\", Herrera said, adding that some discussions were underway already with state governments. \"Right after the elections we will have to assess together, all of us, what the context is and if the conditions allow us to propose any changes to the country's tax structure.\" Herrera added that the government is upwardly revising its 2021 growth forecast to 5.0%-5.5%, saying the United States' $1.9 trillion stimulus package was very important for its southern neighbor's closely-linked economy. As of January, the Mexican finance ministry was forecasting GDP growth of 4.6% this year. Earlier this month, the central bank revised up its main 2021 growth forecast to 4.8%. Mexico's economy suffered its biggest slump since the 1930s last year, shrinking by 8.5% in seasonally-adjusted terms.

        "full article": "March 11 (Reuters) - Known for his popular mobiles, the wide-ranging body of work by late artist Alexander Calder is now on display at the Museum of Modern Art in (MOMA) in New York City. The exhibition, titled \"Alexander Calder: Modern from the Start,\" draws on the rich and varied holdings MOMA has by the American artist. Cara Manes, curator of the exhibition, said her aim was to show how varied and experimental the artist was. \"I think many of us can just close our eyes and imagine a Calder,\" said Manes. \"What I hope this exhibition will show is how multifaceted and varied his practice was.\" Born in Pennsylvania in 1898 and trained as an engineer, Calder, whose father and grandfather were also sculptors, moved to Paris in the 1920s. There, he came under the influence of avant-garde and abstract artists like Fernand Leger, Joan Miro and Marcel Duchamp, who coined the word \"mobiles\" to describe Calder's constructions. \"Simply put, it's a sculpture that moves,\" said Manes. Calder later moved back to the United States and worked out of his studio in Roxbury, Connecticut. He died in 1976. From large, sheet metal sculptures bolted together, to tiny hanging wire caricatures called \"stabiles,\" the MOMA exhibition offers new insight into the resourceful and creative artist. \"His work doesn't easily fit into what we now come to know as very much more rigid categories of art history,\" said Manes. \"Some are figurative, some are abstract. He really straddles these spheres and does so sometimes in the same work.\" Manes said the relationship between Calder and MOMA started in 1930, just one year after the museum opened, and continued for more than four decades. The exhibition draws on MOMA's collection with some additional works on loan from the Calder Foundation. \"Alexander Calder: Modern from the Start\" will be on display from March 14 to Aug. 7, 2021.

        "full article": "WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris and the head of the World Trade Organization agreed on Thursday about the need to reform the global trade body and pledged to work together to boost momentum for the global economy, the White House said. Harris, the first Black and Asian U.S. vice president and the first woman to hold the office, offered strong support to Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the first African and first woman to head the Geneva-based organization, in a phone call on Thursday, the White House said. Okonjo-Iweala is a former Nigerian finance minister. \"They committed to work together to address the economic and health consequences of COVID-19 and climate change, and to prioritize resilience in the global supply chain,\" the White House statement said. The two leaders also agreed on the importance of leveraging trade to promote equity and economic growth, as well as the role that improved living standards, labor rights, human rights and the well-being of working families should play in setting policy. \"The Vice President highlighted the priority of the United States to invest in health and technology as engines for growth and to advance sustainable development,\" it added. The Senate is expected to vote next week to confirm President Joe Biden's nominee as his chief trade negotiator, longtime congressional staffer Katherine Tai. The Senate Finance Committee voted last week to advance Tai's nomination to the full Senate on a voice vote, indicating no significant opposition.

        "full article": "MISSION, Kan. (AP) - A former Missouri jail guard has been convicted of convincing her terminally ill father to fatally shoot her estranged husband with whom she was embroiled in a custody dispute before killing himself so it appeared to be a murder-suicide, prosecutors said Thursday. The Missouri Attorney General's Office made the announcement five days after jurors found Elizabeth Kilgore guilty of first-degree murder, introducing a dangerous instrument into a county jail, acceding to corruption and possession of methamphetamine. Sentencing is set for April. Prosecutors said 77-year-old Charles Sander killed his son-in-law, Lance Kilgore, and himself in September 2018 during what was supposed to be a custody exchange of the couple\u00b4s then 2-year-old son at a convenience store in Osceola, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City. Witness testified at the trial that the defendant vowed that if Lance Kilgore sought custody of their son, she would kill him or have him killed. After the couple separated, Elizabeth Kilgore moved in with her mother and began working at the St. Clair County Jail. While there, she asked two inmates for help killing her husband, a Missouri State Highway Patrol sergeant wrote in charging documents. She was fired one month before the killing after one of the inmates reported that she\u00b4d made the request. She admitted under questioning to smuggling the inmate contraband but denied the solicitation allegation. In a recorded call, however, she can be heard telling the second inmate that her father had offered to \"handle my problem for me.\" Prosecutors said she also suggested that she wanted methamphetamine for her dad, a convicted felon with an extensive history of drug-related arrests, so that he could \"go out with a bang.\" She also threatened to turn her dad in for drugs if he did not take care of Lance Kilgore, the release said. The murder-suicide was captured on store surveillance video. Elizabeth Kilgore arrived minutes later in another vehicle with her son, explaining that she was \"running late,\" the sergeant wrote. Prosecutors said that when she was arrested, police found methamphetamine in her car, a note from an inmate and more than $9000 in cash, which she admitted was her \"run money.\"",

        "full article": "By Matt Scuffham NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were set for a strong start on Friday, following firm overnight leads from Wall Street and Europe as a further retreat in bond yields eased concerns about rampant inflation, restoring appetite for battered tech stocks. Euro zone bond yields fell after the European Central Bank said it was ready to accelerate money-printing to keep a lid on borrowing costs, using its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) more generously over the coming months to stop any unwarranted rise in debt financing costs. Japan's Nikkei 225 futures added 0.62% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures rose 0.55%. E-mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.99%. Australian S&amp;P/ASX 200 futures rose 0.55% in early trading. \"It's looking like we'll see a positive open across Asia-Pacific markets,\" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets. \"The big news overnight was the decision from the ECB. There might be some disappointment they didn't expand their bond purchase program but that's largely offset by undertakings to accelerate the purchases.\" The German 10-year yield was last at -0.332 after falling as far as -0.367%, the lowest level since Feb. 18 and further away from the near one-year high of -0.203% in late February. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.475%, the first time it had dipped below 1.5% in a week. It last yielded 1.5352%, from 1.52% late on Thursday. On Wall Street, the easing inflation worry helped support equities, with the highly valued technology sector leading the way higher, up 2.12%. Expensive stocks, many of which are in the tech sector, have been highly sensitive to the recent rise in yields. In contrast, shares of bank stocks lost 0.47%. Still, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs, the tech-heavy Nasdaq paced the gains, rising more than 2% on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.58%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.04% and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.52%. Sentiment was also boosted by weekly jobless claims data, which pointed to a recovering U.S. labor market as vaccine rollouts helped lead to economic reopenings. European stocks climbed, with the pan-European STOXX 600 higher for a fourth straight day, its longest winning streak in five weeks, with the index closing at its highest level since Feb. 21, 2020. The STOXX 600 index rose 0.49% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.37%. An auction of 30-year U.S. debt on Thursday was viewed as slightly weak, but nowhere near the disappointing seven-year auction in late February that helped fuel inflation concerns and sent yields higher. Analysts largely expect inflation to pick up as vaccine rollouts lead to a reopening of the economy, but worries persist that additional stimulus in the form of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package set to be signed by U.S. President Joe Biden could overheat the economy. The dollar was weaker for a third straight day coming off a 3-1/2-month high of 92.506 on Tuesday. The dollar index fell 0.43%, with the euro down 0.01% to $1.1983. Oil prices resumed their climb following two days of declines, buoyed by the brightening economic outlook and a decline in the dollar. U.S. crude settled up 2.5% at $66.02 per barrel and Brent was at $69.63, up 2.6% on the day. (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Sam Holmes)",

        "title": "Biden says US will be 'close to normal' by July 4, every adult will be eligible for a vaccine by May 1, slams Trump for 'letting COVID spread' and takes credit for Operation Warp Speed in first prime-time speech",
        "full article": "President Joe Biden asked Americans to stay the course fighting the coronavirus while offering hope that life could begin to return to \u2018normal\u2019 later this summer.In a prime time address to the nation, given from the East Room of the White House, Biden outlined the steps his administration has taken to combat the deadly disease, and said the 'goal' was to have Americans enjoy July 4th with their loved ones.\u2018July 4th with your loved one is the goal,\u2019 he said.\u2018If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together by July Fourth there's a good chance you and families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn't mean large events, with lots of people together but it does mean small groups will be able to get together,\u2019 he said.\u2018After this long hard year that will make this Independence Day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.\u2019In his 24-minute speech, Biden offered a renewed sense of hope. And, in his first prime time address as president, he focused solely on the coronavirus, the one issue his presidency will likely be judged upon.He\u00a0outlined the steps his administration has taken to combat the deadly disease, claiming he would meet his original goal of 100 million shots in 100 days by his 16th day in office.\u00a0\u2018No other country in the world has done this. None,\u2019 he said.He said because of the work his administration has done in securing more doses of the vaccine \u2013 including brokering a partnership between Merck and Johnson & Johnson \u2013 he would make all adults eligible to receive the vaccine by May.\u2018I want to talk about the next steps we're thinking about first tonight. I'm announcing that will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults, people 18 and over eligible to be vaccinated, no later than May 1,\u2019 he said. \u2018That's much earlier than expected.\u2019He also said the nation was going from 1 million shots a day to 2 million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world.After bragging about the goals he was breaking, he announced an ambitious goal to have small gatherings by July 4th. \u00a0But, for that to happen, \u2018I need you,\u2019 he said. \u2018I need every American to do their part.\u2019He urged people to get vaccinated, socially distance and wear face masks so the country wouldn\u2019t have to reinstate restrictions in order to get the virus back under control.'If we don't stay vigilant and the conditions change, than we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. Please, we don't want to have to do that again,' he said.\u00a0'We've made so much progress, this is not the time to let up. Just as we were emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules,' he added.And he ended his speech with a simple request: Keep the faith.'You know there's something else that we lost. We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people. But as I stand here tonight, we are proving once again something that I've said time and time again, so you're probably tired of hearing me say it - I say to foreign leaders and domestic alike - it's never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back,' he said.                President Joe Biden said July 4th with loved ones was the 'goal' in his address to the nation         President Biden called for all Americans to be eligible for the COVID vaccine no later than May 1 as part of his plan to reopen the country         First lady Jill Biden stood in the back of the East Room to listen to President Biden as he gave his address to the nationIn his speech, Biden did not mention President Donald Trump, his predecessor, by name when he marked the one year anniversary of the country shutting down. But he slammed how the virus was handled at its start.\u2018A year ago we were hit with a virus that was met with silence. And spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks than month. That lead to more deaths, more infection, more stress and more loneliness. Photos and videos in 2019 feel like they were taken in another era,\u2019 he said.His speech also offered a message of hope, saying \u2018finding the light\u2019 is what Americans do during a crisis.\u2018But in the loss we saw how much there was to gain an appreciation, respect and gratitude. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do,\u2019 he said.He acknowledged the hardships people have faced.\u2018It's the details of life we miss the most and we miss those details. The big details and the small moments, weddings, birthdays, graduations, all the things that needed to happen, but didn't. The first date, the family reunions, the Sunday night rituals. It's all exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others. To talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another. But this virus has kept us apart,\u2019 he said.And he offered the heart breaking observation that \u2018the things we used to do that always fill us with joy had become things we couldn't do.\u2019And he forcefully denounced the increase in hate crime against Asians.\u2018Too often we have turned against one another. A mask, the easiest thing to do to save live, sometimes it divides us. States pitted against one another instead of working with one another. Vicious hate crimes against Asian-Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated,\u2019 he said.\u2018At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans are on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives and still, still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America,\u2019 he noted.And he declared: \u2018It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop.\u2019Biden's comments defending Asian-Americans come one day after Trump, again, used the racist phrase 'China virus' in a statement taking credit for the swift development of COVID-19 vaccines.'I hope everyone remembers when they're getting the COVID-19 (often referred to as the China virus) vaccine, that if I wasn't president, you wouldn't be getting that beautiful \"shot\" for five years, at best, and probably wouldn't be getting it at all,' the ex-president wrote.Biden previously made moves to stop usage of the term by signing an executive order titled 'Memorandum Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States' on day No. 6 of his presidency.'The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,' the order said. 'Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.'         President Biden, wearing his face mask, walks into the East Room to deliver his speech         President Biden spoke with the flags from the 50 states behind himHis administration also outlined the next steps in the battle against COVID, which has killed more than 530,000 Americans.That will include:Deliver vaccines directly to up to an additional 700 community health centers that reach underserved communities, increasing the total number of participating centers to 950.\u00a0Double the number of pharmacies in the federal pharmacy program to more than 20,000.\u00a0Expand mobile operations in hard-hit communities.\u00a0Deploy\u00a04,000 activity duty troops to help with vaccine efforts, bringing total to 6,000. Double the number of federally run mass vaccination centers.\u00a0Expand vaccinators to dentists, paramedics, physician assistants, veterinarians, and medical and healthcare students.\u00a0Launch a new federally supported Find a Vaccination website by May 1.\u00a0Launch a call center with a 1-800 number by May 1 to help people find vaccinations.\u00a0Deploy technology teams to states that need help improving their websites.\u00a0Direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue additional guidance on what people can do after being fully vaccinated, addressing travel, gatherings, work and houses of worship.\u00a0Supply federal financing to help expand testing in schools.\u00a0Have the Department of Education host a national Safe School Reopening Summit this month.\u00a0Biden's speech marked the one-year anniversary of Trump's Oval Office address on the coronavirus pandemic, in which typos in his copy led to Americans in Europe believing they'd be cut off from coming back to the U.S.Trump's travel ban from Europe wasn't supposed to include American citizens, permanent residents and their family members.U.S. stock futures fell more than 600 points during his 10-minute remarks.

That's what the essence of this is,' Biden said at the signing ceremony.'Done,'\u00a0 he said upon fixing his signature to the legislation. He signed it in the Oval Office with Vice President Kamala Harris at his side.\u00a0'Democrats and Republican friends have made it clear, people out there, made it clear they strongly support the American Rescue Plan,' he said in brief remarks, adding that he would have more to say in his prime time address Thursday night.He did not respond to questions.\u00a0\u00a0'We're going to be on the road not only talking about - what I'm talking about tonight is the impact on the virus, how we're going to end this pandemic,' he said of the law, which will provide stimulus checks to many Americans, money for COVID vaccines and funding to help schools reopen.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the first round of stimulus checks will hit people's bank accounts this weekend.'People can expect to start seeing direct deposits hit their bank accounts as early as this weekend. This is, of course, just the first wave,' she said at her press briefing on Thursday. 'And payments to eligible Americans will continue throughout the course of the next several weeks.'                President Biden was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris for the signing the American Rescue Plan into lawThe president will hold a signing celebration at the White House on Friday with congressional leaders. Only Democrats are expected to attend with members from the House and Senate to be in attendance.\u00a0         The original plan was for him to sign the legislation on Friday but it was moved up after the 'enrollment' process finished. That is the process legislation goes through after it is approved by Congress but before it can be signed into law.Republicans had accused Biden of trying to hold a PR stunt by stringing out the process and holding the signing on Friday instead of when the bill was ready.

Barack was so modest,' Biden told House Democrats last week. 'I kept saying, 'Tell people what we did.' He said, 'We don't have time. I'm not going to take a victory lap.' And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.'A new CNN poll\u00a0found that 61% support the COVID relief plan, which includes $1,400\u00a0direct payments to most Americans, $350 billion in aid to state and local governments, an expansion of the child tax credit and increased funding for vaccine distribution.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is demanding the credit for the coronavirus vaccine shots that are now making their way into Americans' arms at an accelerated clip \u2013 claiming there would be no vaccine for another five years without him.\u00a0'I hope everyone remembers when they're getting the COVID-19\u00a0(often referred to as the China\u00a0Virus) vaccine, that if I wasn't president, you wouldn't be getting that beautiful 'shot' for five years, at best, and probably wouldn't be getting it at all,' he wrote in a statement that came out Wednesday evening.           Donald Trump, pictured, sought to take credit for America's vaccine success after some of the available jabs were developed under his presidency\u00a0           Trump issued the statement under the letterhead of The Office of Donald J. Trump but it read like one of the tweets he has been unable to send since his social media ban\u00a0              The statement was carried on his official 45th President letterhead \u2013 though it took on the tone of one of his famous tweets before getting banned from Twitter after the Jan. 6th MAGA riot.\u00a0\u00a0Trump's plea comes as credit for the vaccine that could soon transform the daily lives of millions of Americans was already taking shape.The Pfizer vaccine, which was first out of the gate, was developed privately. But the Moderna vaccine, which like Pfizer is extremely effective, got assistance from Trump's 'Operation Warp Speed.'Biden on Thursday announced plans to purchase an additional 100 million Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses.\u00a0\u00a0Since taking office, the Biden team has taken to blasting the state of the vaccine program they inherited, particularly on the distribution side \u2013 despite its vaccine development efforts getting credit during the transition.\u00a0Additionally, Biden and his coronavirus advisor Andy Slavitt were put on the defensive when the AP reported in a fact check that both had overstated the 'record' 2.9 million doses given Saturday. The real number was 1.6 million. The earlier CDC figure had included doses from other days.\u00a0          Biden's first prime time address in full as he tells Americans to 'listen to Dr Fauci' and takes credit for the vaccine rollout\u00a0 Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight I would like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic. A year ago, we were hit with the virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked - denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness.Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era - the last vacation, the last birthday with friends, the last holiday with extended family. While it was different for everyone, we all lost something a collective suffering, collective sacrifice, a year filled with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us, but in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect and gratitude.Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do, and that is what we have done. We have seen front-line and essential workers risking their lives, sometimes losing them to save and help others; researchers and scientists bracing for a vaccine; and so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all of the broken places. I know it\u00b4s been hard; I truly know.As I've told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with a number of Americans who have died from COVID to date; it\u00b4s on the back of my schedule. As of now, total deaths in America 527,726. That\u00b4s more deaths than in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War and 9/11 combined. They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors, young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even have a funeral, but I\u00b4m also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes by cruel fate of accident or other disease. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave behind loved ones who are hurting badly.         President Joe Biden takes off his mask to speak about the COVID-19 pandemic during a prime-time address from the East Room of the White HouseYou know you've often heard me say before I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child\u00b4s bedroom to say I'm sorry I lost my job, can't be here anymore, like my dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton. So many of you had to make that same walk this past year; you lost your job, you closed your business, facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, the loss of control, maybe worst of all the loss of hope.Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more because they have not been in school because of their loss of learning. It\u00b4s the details of life that matter the most, and we miss those details, the big details and the small moments, weddings, birthdays, graduations; all of the things that needed to happen but didn't - a first date, the family reunions, the Sunday night rituals, it\u00b4s all exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us.For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another, but this virus has kept us apart. Grandparents haven\u00b4t seen their children or grandchildren; parents haven\u00b4t seen their kids; kids haven\u00b4t seen their friends. The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become things we couldn't do and broke our hearts. Too often, we've turned against one another. A mask, the easiest thing to do to save lives sometimes, it divides us. States pitted against one another instead of working with each other; vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.At this very moment, so many of them - our fellow Americans on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives - and still, still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It\u00b4s wrong, it\u00b4s un-American, and it must stop.Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus; tell the truth, follow the scientists, the science, work together, put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people - no function more important. We need to remember the government isn\u00b4t some foreign force in a distant capital; no, it\u00b4s us, all of us. We, the people.For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose, and right now, my friends, we are doing just that, and I have to say, as your President, I\u00b4m grateful to you. Last summer, I was in Philadelphia, and I met a small-business owner, a woman, and I asked her, I said, \"What do you need most?\" Never forget what she said to me. She said, she looked me in the eye, and she said, \"I just want the truth, the truth, just tell me the truth.\"Think of that. My fellow Americans, you are owed nothing less than the truth. And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus. You have been hearing me say that for - while I was running and the last 50 days I have been President, but this is one of the most complex operations we have ever undertaken as a nation in a long time.That\u00b4s why I\u00b4m using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean the war footing, and thank God we are making some real progress now. In my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. We have spent every day since attempting to carry it out.Two months ago, a country - this country didn't have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the American public, but soon we will. We have been working with vaccine manufacturers Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines, and now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson & Johnson vaccines, which is one shot.In fact, just yesterday I announced, and I met with the CEOs of both companies, I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccines. These two companies, competitors, have come together for the good of the nation, and they should be applauded for it. It\u00b4s truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II. Now because all of the work we've done, we will have enough vaccines for all adults in America by the end of May.           Biden said the US would be heading towards normality by July 4 when families and friends will be able to celebrate Independence Day in 'small groups'.That\u00b4s months ahead of schedule, and we are mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccines in one\u00b4s arm, calling active-duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators - and to those who administer the shots. And we\u00b4ve been creating more places to get the shots. We\u00b4ve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one - any 1 of 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot.We\u00b4re also working with governors and mayors in red states and blue states to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car and drive home in less than an hour.We've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America located in underserved areas, and we\u00b4ve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles from pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it. We continue to work on making at-home testing available. And we\u00b4ve been focused on serving people in the hardest hit communities of this pandemic: Black, Latino, Native American and rural communities.So what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8% of Americans - after months, only 8% of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is 65%. Just 14% of Americans over the age of 75 50 days ago had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70%.With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, that came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents, who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people are fully vaccinated, the CDC will continue to provide additional guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends, as well as travel.When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was that kind of way over the top. I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people\u00b4s arms in my first 100 days in office. Tonight, I can say we\u00b4re not only going to meet that goal. We\u00b4re going to beat that goal because we\u00b4ve actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None.And I want to talk about the next steps for thinking about. First, tonight, I\u00b4m announcing that I will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults, people 18 and over, eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again. All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1.That\u00b4s much earlier than expected. Let me be clear, that doesn\u00b4t mean everyone\u00b4s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you\u00b4ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot. And to do this, we\u00b4re going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December before I was sworn in, to maintaining, beating our current pace of 2 million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world.Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch with our partners new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones.Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan - and I thank, again, the House and Senate for passing it - and my announcement last month, I have a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers. We can accelerate massive nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal that I stated at the same time of about 100 million shots - of opening the majority of K through 8 schools in my first 100 days in office. This is going to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.           Biden was also criticized for taking credit for the vaccine rollout that began under TrumpFourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly, I promise I will do everything in my power. I will not relent until we beat this virus. But I need you, the American people, I need you. I need every American to do their part. That\u00b4s not hyperbole, I need you.I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity and to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated as well. Because here\u00b4s the point. If we do all this, if we do our part, we do this together, by July the 4th, there\u00b4s a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day.That doesn't mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together. After this long, hard year that will make this Independence Day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we began to mark our independence from this virus. But to get there, we can\u00b4t let our guard down. This fight is far from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, I\u00b4ll tell you the truth.On July 4th with your loved ones is the goal. But a goal - a lot can happen. Conditions can change. The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread. We\u00b4ve got work to do to ensure that everyone has confidence and the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines.So my message to you is this. Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He\u00b4s assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they\u00b4re safe. Vice President Harris and I know they\u00b4re safe. That\u00b4s why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so, for the world to see so you get to see us do it. The first lady and the second gentleman also got vaccinated.Talk to your family, friends, your neighbors, the people you know best who have gotten the vaccine. We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the mask as recommended by the CDC, because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.And national unity isn't just how politics and politicians vote in Washington and what the loudest voices are saying on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans, because if we don\u00b4t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And please, we don\u00b4t want to do that again. We've made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we were emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules.I\u00b4ll close with this. We've lost so much over the last year. We've lost family and friends. We've lost businesses and dreams we spent years building. We've lost time, time with each other. And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools, no graduation ceremonies this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies.You know, and there's something else we lost. We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people. But as I stand here tonight, we\u00b4re proving once again something I\u00b4ve said time and time again to the - probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it to foreign leaders and domestic alike. It\u00b4s never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people.America is coming back. The development, manufacture, distribution of vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It's one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. We also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars, stunning images of our dreams that are now reality, another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment and belief in science and one another.And today I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, a historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people, includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks, payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit, or in a check, a Treasury check.It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers health care premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it funds all the steps I\u00b4ve just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs.In the coming weeks and months, I\u00b4ll be traveling, along with the first lady, the vice president, the second gentleman and members of my Cabinet to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails in any place, I will acknowledge that it failed, but it will not; about how after long, dark years, one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead.If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we'll have proven once again that this country can do anything, hard things, big things, important things.Over a year ago, no one could have imagined what we were about to go through, but now we're coming through it. And it's a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. We are also bound together by the hope and the possibilities in the days in front of us.My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we've been through, we'll come together as one people, one nation, one America. I believe we can and we will. We\u00b4re seizing this moment in history, I believe, will record we faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation\u00b4s history, the darkest we've ever known.I promise you we'll come out stronger with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities and to our country. This is the United States of America, and there's nothing, nothing, from the bottom of my heart I believe this, there\u00b4s nothing we can't do when we do it together.So, God bless you all. And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone. May God protect our troops. Thank you for taking the time to listen. I look forward to seeing you.\u00a0 Advertisement\n  What's in the coronavirus bill  Relief checksPresident Joe Biden and Senate Democrats tightened eligibility for the $1,400 payments to secure support from wavering Democratic senators.But under the Senate bill being voted on in the House Wednesday, the phaseout stops at $80,000.\u00a0Under the earlier House-passed version, the cash payment would have phased out for singles with incomes between $75,000 and $100,000.\u00a0Under the original House bill, the cash payment for married couples phased out between $150,000 and $200,000. But under the Senate bill heading to Joe Biden's desk, the phaseout stops at $160,000.Most Americans will still be getting the full amount. The median household income was $68,703 in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Roughly 8 million fewer households will get a check under the Senate bill compared with what the House passed, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center.\u00a0Money for state and local governments\u00a0\u00a0The Senate-passed bill provides $350 billion for state and local governments but adds the stipulation that the money can only cover costs incurred by the end of 2024. The Senate bill also prohibits states from using the money to offset tax cuts, nor can it be used to shore up a pension fund. The bill also requires that small states get at least the amount they received under virus legislation that Congress passed last March. Lawmakers are looking to focus the money on covering costs and revenue shortfalls arising from the pandemic.\u00a0Aid for the jobless\u00a0\u00a0The Senate-passed bill extends enhanced unemployment benefits through Sept. 6 at $300 a week. Also, the first $10,200 of benefits would non-taxable. The provision applies to households with incomes under $150,000.Passage came after a compromise that knocked down the House-passed higher payment of $400 per week, with the extension running until Aug. 29. That\u00b4s on top of what beneficiaries are getting through their state unemployment insurance program.\u00a0More money for hospitals\u00a0Hospital trade groups lobbied senators to tack on more money for hospitals to help maintain sufficient staffing and purchase personal protective equipment while caring for large numbers of critically ill patients.The Senate bill being taken up by the House adds $8.5 billion for rural providers for COVID-19 relief.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Health insurance help\u00a0\u00a0Workers who lose their job can remain on their company\u00b4s health plan for up to 18 months under a law known as COBRA, but they typically must pay the full monthly premium.The House bill temporarily subsidized 85% of the insurance premiums, which can be expensive. The bill that passed the Senate include a 100% subsidy of COBRA health insurance premiums to ensure that the laid-off workers can remain on their employer health plans at no cost through the end of September.\u00a0\u00a0Provisions for children and studentsThe bill provides $7.5 billion for vaccine distribution, along with $48 billion for testing and contract tracing.It provides $39 billion for child care, amid studies showing women have been disproportionately kept out of the workforce due to schools closing in-person learning.Schools and universities also get $160 billion in direct aide, but there are provisions meant to ensure it gets spent in the next few years.It also expands the child tax credit to $3,000 per child \u2013 in a provision projected to cause a steep drop in child poverty. It is an increase of $1,000 from the current credit, which is fully refundable on tax returns. There is an additional $600 for children under six.\u00a0Amtrak and other winners\u00a0\u00a0Amtrak would get an additional $200 million on top of the $1.5 billion in the House bill, for a total of $1.7 billion. There\u00b4s also an additional $510 million for homeless services under the Federal Emergency Management Agency and $175 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. All COVID-19 student loan relief would be tax-free.\u00a0No $15 minimum wage hike\u00a0\u00a0The Senate-passed bill being voted on in the House does not include an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. It got stripped out after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the minimum wage increase violated strict budget rules limiting what can be included in a package that can be passed with 51 votes rather than the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster.- AP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advertisement",

        "title": "Montana Native Americans worried about legislative influence",
        "full article": "HELENA, Mont. (AP) - Bills that sought to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day were tabled in committee. Funding for two state positions dedicated to Native American communities were cut. The only Native American member of Montana's human rights commission wasn't retained. This year's state legislative session in Montana - where Republicans hold at least a two-thirds majority in both Houses and have a GOP governor for the first time in 16 years - has triggered concerns from some Native Americans and their allies who fear they are losing influence and representation. Democratic Sen. Susan Webber of Browning said she sees discrimination and racism in the actions. \"Legislators, including the Indian Caucus, make every attempt to be civil. However, it\u00b4s hard when the Indian people are attacked over and over, day after day,\" she said. Republicans pushed back against any suggestion of discrimination. \"The insinuation that the Legislature is using legislation to discriminate against Native Americans, including Senate GOP members\u00b4 own constituents and a member of the Senate Republican caucus, is absurd,\" Kyle Schmauch, spokesperson for Senate Republicans, said in an email.          This March 27, 2019 photo shows Montana Democratic Sen. Shane Morigeau of Missoula speaking on the floor of the state House in Helena, Montana, during the legislative session. Morigeau said the 2021 legislative session has been \"a nightmare for Indian Country and Montana Indians,\" in part due to bills that could make it more difficult for Native Americans living on reservations to vote and the removal of Margarett Campbell from the Montana Human Rights Commission, which leaves the commission without Native American representation for the fist time in at least 16 years. (Thom Bridge/Independent Record via AP)  Dylan Klapmeier, a spokesperson for House Republicans, said any suggestion that there is legislation aimed at discrimination \"is unbelievable and has no basis in fact.\" Native American lawmakers are also concerned about several election-related bills that members of the American Indian Caucus argue will make it more difficult for Native Americans, low-income residents, disabled people and rural Montanans to vote. Montana is among at least 43 states considering legislation aimed at restricting voter access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The effort was prompted by former President Donald Trump's false claims of widespread voter fraud. The concerns in Montana come during a historic moment for Native American representation in government as U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland of New Mexico gets ready to become the first Native American to lead a U.S. Cabinet agency as Interior secretary. Descriptions of her as \"radical\" by white, male Republicans has raised questions about whether she is being treated differently because she is a Native American woman. \"It\u00b4s been a nightmare for Indian Country and Montana Indians,\" said Sen. Shane Morigeau, a Democrat from Missoula and one of 11 Native Americans in the Montana Legislature, all but two of whom are Democrats. \"An anti-Indian world still exists. People wait for the right times to jump out and make their moves.\" There are 12 tribal nations in Montana with a population of nearly 67,000 in 2019, just over 6% of the state's total population of 1.07 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's figures. There have been some wins for Native American causes this session. A House committee on Feb. 26 looked favorably on a bill by Democratic Rep. Sharon Stewart Peregoy of Crow Agency to make it easier for Native Americans to vote by requiring satellite elections offices and ballot drop boxes on reservations to reduce travel time for tribal members to access voting services. Lawmakers also voted unanimously to continue the Montana Missing Indigenous Persons task force, a victory that was realized in the 2019 session. Republican Sen. Jason Small of Busby, a member of the Northern Cheyenne tribe, sponsored the legislation to create and continue the task force. Still, the losses are adding up. A budget committee cut funding for the American Indian health director and the tribal relations manager within the Department of Public Health and Human Services. Gov. Greg Gianforte believes those proposed cuts \"are the wrong course of action,\" and will work to restore the funding, Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for the governor, said on March 1. Gianforte also opposed a $500,000 cut to a program to help preserve tribal languages. The funding was restored. Gianforte declined to support former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock's nomination of Margarett Campbell to the Human Rights Commission, leaving the commission without Native American representation for the first time in at least 16 years. Campbell was nominated in 2019, after the Legislature adjourned, so she had not yet been confirmed by the state Senate. Gianforte asked lawmakers to reject her nomination and instead confirm Helena attorney Rick Bartos. \"I just think that is very, very important that the minority population of Montana is represented on all boards and commissions,\" Campbell said. Campbell is chief diversity officer at Montana State University-Northern in Havre, has 38 years of experience in higher education and is a former majority leader in the Montana House. Morigeau called Campbell's removal a travesty. \"Having Native representation on the Human Rights Commission makes sense when you look at the history of discrimination in the state and country,\" he said. Bartos also has experience in education and was bureau chief of Adult Protective Services within the health department. As an attorney, he has advocated for the rights of disabled students in public schools, the governor's office said. \"The governor has identified well-qualified Montanans to serve on our state\u00b4s boards and commissions who can help lead Montana\u00b4s comeback and who share his positive vision for Montana\u00b4s future,\" Stroyke said when asked about the governor not supporting Campbell's nomination. With a stated goal of preventing voter fraud, Republican lawmakers are moving forward with a series of bills that Native American lawmakers say will result in making it more difficult for tribal members living on reservations to vote. One would place restrictions on organizations that collect absentee ballots, similar to a voter-passed referendum that has already been declared unconstitutional by a state judge because it places a higher burden on voting rights for Native American who can live many miles from polling places and may not have access to a reliable vehicle and money for gas. Andy Werk Jr., president of the Fort Belknap tribe in northern Montana, called the bill \"intentional discrimination\" during a recent meeting of the Montana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Another bill that has passed the House would end same-day voter registration, requiring registrations be completed by noon on the Monday before Election Day. Supporters say ending same-day registration will reduce voting lines and result in less work for clerks on Election Day. But the change would mean two trips to elections offices for new voters and will hurt tribes the most, Webber said. Bills seeking to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day did not make it out of committee even though no one testified against them. Supporters argued that celebrating Columbus Day ignores the rape, murder and genocide endured by Indigenous people during the European settlement of North America. \"I don\u00b4t agree that there was enough evidence that Christopher Columbus was intentionally as horrible as everybody said he was,\" said Republican Sen. Gordon Vance of Belgrade, \"but I do feel the fact that American Indian Heritage Day is the fourth Friday in September does honor the Native Americans.\" ___ This story has been updated to correct that there are 11 Native Americans in the Legislature, not 10, and all but two of whom are Democrats, not all but one.          This March 23, 2017 photo shows Democratic Rep. Sharon Stewart Peregoy of Crow Agency argues against a bill during the legislative session in Helena, Montana. Peregoy has introduced a bill during the 2021 session to make it easier for Native Americans living on reservations to vote, including requiring satellite offices and ballot drop boxes to reduce travel time for tribal members to access voting services. Stewart Peregoy's bill was well received by a House committee. (Thom Bridge/Independent Record via AP)           This April 15, 2019 photo, Democratic Sen. Diane Sands of Missoula and Democratic Sen.

        "full article": "By Michelle Nichols NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and others are seeking support for a coalition to defend the United Nations Charter by pushing back against the use or threat of force and unilateral sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday. The move by 16 countries and the Palestinians to create such a group comes as U.S. President Joe Biden's new administration boosts its multilateral engagement and with allies, reversing former President Donald Trump's favored unilateral approach as he focused on an \"America First\" policy. Biden has also pledged to take on China at the United Nations, where Beijing has been pushing for greater global influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership. A concept note for the \"Group of Friends in Defense of the Charter of the United Nations,\" seen by Reuters, states that multilateralism \"is currently under an unprecedented attack, which, in turn, threatens global peace and security.\" However, a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, responded: \"These so-called friends are the ones who have done most to breach the charter. Maybe they should start by respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in their own countries.\" Other founding members of the group are Algeria, Angola, Belarus, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cuba, Eritrea, Laos, Nicaragua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Syria and Venezuela. The concept note said \"the world is seeing a growing resort to unilateralism, marked by isolationist and arbitrary actions, including the imposition of unilateral coercive measures or the withdrawal from landmark agreements and multilateral institutions, as well as by attempts to undermine critical efforts to tackle common and global challenges.\" Under Trump, Washington announced plans to quit the World Health Organization, pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, a global climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal. But Biden, who took office in January, rescinded the withdrawal from the WHO, returned the United States to the climate agreement, re-engaged with the Geneva-based Human Rights Council and is seeking to re-enter to the international nuclear deal.

        "full article": "WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Senior U.S. and Israel officials focused on concerns about Iran during the first virtual meeting of a bilateral strategic group on Thursday, the White House said, an issue on which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has differences with the new Biden administration. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat, headed the delegations, said Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council. \"During the discussion, the two sides shared perspectives on regional security issues of mutual interest and concern, including Iran, and expressed their common determination to confront the challenges and threats facing the region,\" she said in a statement, which provided few details. The Biden administration has depicted the meeting as part of its efforts to consult allies and partners as its seeks to draw Iran into talks about Tehran and Washington resuming compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. U.S. overtures to Iran have set the stage for possible new strains in the U.S.-Israel alliance. Biden's White House predecessor, Donald Trump, withdrew the United States from the world powers' agreement with Iran, deeming it too advantageous for Tehran - a view Israel shared - and reimposed U.S. sanctions. Netanyahu has made clear his opposition to a U.S. return to the deal. The State Department on Thursday repeated that the United States will not offer Iran unilateral incentives to attend talks that it has rejected so far about resuming compliance with the deal, which gave Tehran sanctions relief in return for limits on its nuclear program. Israel hopes to prevent personal tension between Netanyahu and Biden over their differences on the Iranian nuclear question by delegating talks on the topic to their senior staff, an Israeli official said late last month. \"The National Security Advisors agreed on the importance of strategic interagency consultations and pledged to continue to these engagements,\" Horne said.

        "full article": "Scott Morrison will seek to find shared solutions to speeding up the global coronavirus vaccine rollout and improving regional security when he meets with the leaders of Japan, India and the United States. The so-called Quad meeting has been held at foreign minister level since 2007 but the virtual summit early Saturday morning will be the first at leadership level. The prime minister will be joined by US President Joe Biden, Japanese leader Yoshihide Suga and India's Narendra Modi. \"This is about four nations that have had a long-term interest in the Indo-Pacific,\" he told reporters in Sydney on Friday. \"This is about an anchor for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.\" Mr Morrison said it would have flow-on effects especially for ASEAN nations. \"This is about ensuring that we can trade more easily and peacefully, that there is freedom of movement within the seas and overflight of the area, to ensure that there is facilitation of trade and movement across our great region.\" The US is looking to strengthen ties with key allies as China takes an increasingly assertive diplomatic and security approach in the Indo-Pacific region. India has urged the other Quadrilateral Security Dialogue members to invest in its vaccine production capacity, in an attempt to counter China's widening vaccine diplomacy. A new financing agreement for India's vaccine program is expected to be on the agenda. The White House says the \"climate crisis\" will also be a key part of the talks, expected to go for about two hours. Mr Biden is returning the US to the Paris agreement following Donald Trump pulling the nation out of the climate pact, and is pledging more ambition in cutting emissions. India's Foreign Ministry said the summit would cover supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security and climate change. Japan is understood to be pressing for greater cooperation on securing rare earth metals crucial to the production of electric car motors and other products. The Biden administration has embarked on a review of the US approach towards China, in the wake of Mr Trump plunging the diplomatic relationship into crisis. It also comes as Chinese leaders meet in Beijing for the National People's Congress, with President Xi Jinping saying the People's Liberation Army must be prepared to respond to \"complex and difficult\" situations. \"The current security situation of our country is largely unstable and uncertain,\" President Xi said.",

        "title": "US-Canada border decision looms in playoffs for NHL",
        "full article": "A year after the pandemic temporarily shut down the NHL, a handful of roadblocks remain to handing out the Stanley Cup again this season - including the U.S.-Canada border. The border remains closed to nonessential travel, an issue the NHL addressed before the 2021 season began in January by realigning its divisions. All seven teams in the North Division are based in Canada and they play against only each other through the first two rounds of the postseason. But the league has a decision looming on what to do when a Canadian team faces a U.S. opponent in the third round of the playoffs. Talks are ongoing with Canadian government officials, though nothing needs to be settled yet since cross-border play won't happen until mid-June. \"We\u00b4ve got a little bit of time to deal with this,\" Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said during a video interview Thursday. \"I can\u00b4t certainly promise any result, and we\u00b4ll work through the process and we\u00b4ll see what the result is and we\u00b4ll respond appropriately. But in terms of timeline, I don\u00b4t think there\u00b4s any kind of firm deadline that we have to meet to accomplish a change in plans if that\u00b4s necessary.\" One possibility includes the North Division champion that reaches the league's final four playing its \"home\" games in a U.S. city. Or there could be some type of modified quarantine when teams cross the border. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the NHL isn\u00b4t planning to hold the playoffs in any kind of a bubble like it did in Toronto and Edmonton last year but it could do something similar to that if necessary to accommodate Canadian regulations.          The Carolina Hurricanes salute the fans, who returned to PNC Arena for the first time this season, after a win over the Detroit Red Wings in an NHL hockey game in Raleigh, N.C., Thursday, March 4, 2021. AP Photo/Chris Seward)  \"We are going to try and maintain our flexibility and our agility,\" Bettman said, \"and we will be respectful of the process.\" The league has also said it won't jump the line for vaccines, but some machinations are ongoing about what could happen once inoculations are available to the general public. D \"Like everything else, it\u00b4s kind of a work in progress, and I think it\u00b4s going to evolve in different stages based on the introduction of the vaccine,\" said Daly, who believes several players with pre-existing conditions have already been vaccinated. \"At some point we\u00b4ll get into a position, I would think and I would hope, where there\u00b4s widespread vaccination. I think our response to that will be in stages, as well, as to what that means and how we evolve our protocols.\" Those protocols have already changed this season, helping to cut the number of players on the COVID-19 protocol list from a season-high 59 on Feb. 12 to four on Wednesday. A total of 138 players have spent at least one day on the list. A total of 35 games have been postponed for virus-related reasons. \"We\u00b4ve navigated through the first two months of this season under extremely challenging conditions, and we\u00b4ve been on this every day with the medical experts and enhancing our protocols, and it\u00b4s gotten us to a better place,\" Bettman said. In matters more in the NHL's control, Daly said the draft \"more likely than not\" will go on as scheduled July 23-24, despite concerns from some team executives about many prospects not playing this season. ___ AP Hockey Writer John Wawrow contributed.

        "title": "SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE: The night 'Chips' Channon sailed into a very salty royal mix-up",
        "full article": "There has never been another American interloper quite like Sir Henry 'Chips' Channon, who married a Guinness heiress and became both an MP and the darling of London society.But perhaps even Channon would have been astonished that his Diaries \u2014 now published in unexpurgated form for the first time \u2014 would inspire frenzied debate more than eight decades after he wrote them.One entry \u2014 for November 19, 1936 \u2014 is generating particular excitement. This now records not just that 'tiaras nodded [and] diamonds sparkled' at the dinner party Channon and his wife held for Edward VIII at their house in London's Belgravia, but also the King's startlingly modern turn of phrase when, after dinner, he announced that he needed to relieve himself.'At length he rose, and said: 'I want to pump s***',' reads the newly published edition, 'and I led His Majesty to our loulou! He proceeded to pass water without shutting the door, talking to me the while.'         There has never been another American interloper quite like Sir Henry 'Chips' Channon (pictured with Lady Honor Guinness leaving St Margaret's Westminster in 1933), who married a Guinness heiress and became both an MP and the darling of London society         Pictured: The Duke of Windsor at his temporary home in Ashdown Forest, SussexThis has prompted broadcaster and writer Libby Purves to argue that the King had in fact said 'pump ship', meaning to urinate \u2014 an expression, she says, which is 'still common among naval and yachting types'.Purves's interjection has caused the Diaries' editor, Simon Heffer, to re-inspect Channon's work. 'I got the senior trustee to send me a photograph of that page of the manuscript,' he tells me. 'It's a 'T' and not a 'P'.' Heffer adds that he has 'no naval connections' and so was unfamiliar with the sea-dog slang: 'I didn't know it and Chips obviously didn't know it either.'He probably thought that because the King was saying he wanted to go to the lavatory, it was 'pump s***'. Whether he misheard or misunderstood I don't know. I'm sure that Edward VIII did not say 'pump s***'; I'm sure he said 'pump ship'. It means that the just published hardback edition is destined to become a collector's item.\u00a0'When we get round to the paperback, we'll change it \u2014 for the avoidance of doubt \u2013 and include an explanatory footnote along the lines of: 'This is what Chips wrote, and he may well have misheard,' ' says Heffer.\u00a0'But at the moment we're leaving it as it is.'\u00a0 Hugh Bonneville and Keeley Hawes portray Roald Dahl and his wife in the recently released film To Olivia.\u00a0But will Hawes be socially distancing herself from Bonneville after he made an edgy quip about her ubiquity on Ed Vaizey's podcast Break Out Culture?\u00a0'I am a massive Keeley Hawes fan partly because I can't turn on the television without seeing something Keeley Hawes is in,' declared Lord Vaizey.\u00a0Bonneville replied: 'She's everywhere! I call her Covid now.'\u00a0 A city high-flyer with nine children, Dame Helena Morrissey has earned her 'Supermum' soubriquet. Now she has written a book for women on how to emulate her success \u2014 and, surprisingly, pink lipstick plays a big part.'Women are often told to act like men and blend in, but I feel that sells us short,' she tells me.\u00a0'Fashion is a significant part of it. It seems frivolous but it isn't,' insists Helena, whose book, Style And Substance, will be published in October.\u00a0'Women should be able to discuss pink lipstick at work in the way men talk about football.

        "full article": "HONOLULU (AP) - A young humpback whale swimming off the Hawaiian island of Maui has been freed of about 100 feet of line entangled in its mouth and flipper. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary coordinated the effort in partnership with local businesses and organizations, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday. On Tuesday, the team cut off line that was wrapped around the whale\u00b4s flipper and trailing about 50 feet (15 meters) behind it. Some of the line entangled in the whale's mouth was unable to be removed, officials said. \"When the flipper came free, the whale sped up, its tail got higher and it started moving better,\" said Ed Lyman, the sanctuary\u00b4s Natural Resource Management Specialist. \"All that was promising. We were defeated on the mouth again. We pulled, but you can\u00b4t pull too hard.\" Lyman said the juvenile whale was not in very good condition. It was emaciated and had patches of whale lice. More than 100 feet (30.5 meters) of line was removed.

His team was unable to find the whale at that time. \"We definitely helped it, and increased its chances of survival,\" he said. \"But it\u00b4s worse off than we thought.\" Lyman said people should report any whale entanglements sightings to federal authorities and should not try to help the whales themselves. Without special permits it is against the law to get within 100 yards (91 meters) of a humpback in the water or within 1,000 feet (305 meters) with a drone or aircraft.

        "full article": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The Buffalo Bills re-signed linebacker Matt Milano to a four-year contract on Thursday, less than a week before the starter was eligible to become a free agent. The signing comes a day after the Bills freed up more than $14.4 million in space under the salary cap by releasing receiver John Brown and defensive lineman Quinton Jefferson. Milano had been preparing to test free agency, which opens Wednesday, after believing the Bills wouldn\u00b4t be able to match the offers he anticipated attracting on the open market. Bills general manager Brandon Beane in January even raised the prospect of not being able to afford re-signing Milano by saying: \"He\u00b4s earned this right and we\u00b4ll just have to see how it plays out.\" The 26-year-old Milano has been a starter since the second half of his rookie season in 2017. Drafted in the fifth round out of Boston College, he has developed into a key contributor when healthy. Milano's versatility at the outside linebacker position to defend against the run and pass made him a valuable three-down player in Buffalo\u00b4s defensive system. An assortment of injuries limited him to appearing in just 11 regular-season games and six starts this past year in which Milano still posted career-bests with 3 1/2 sacks and nine quarterback pressures. Including playoffs, the Bills had a 12-1 record with Milano in the lineup last season.

In 2018, he was the NFL\u00b4s only player with at least 75 tackles, three interceptions and three fumble recoveries. Overall, Milano has five interceptions, five fumble recoveries and a forced fumble in 55 career games, including 39 starts. ___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "full article": "Sandro Mamukelashvili scored 20 points and came up with a clutch block in overtime as fifth-seeded Seton Hall outlasted fourth-seeded St. John's for a 77-69 victory Thursday afternoon in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden. The Pirates (14-12) advanced to face eighth-seeded Georgetown in the semifinals on Friday by making enough plays in overtime when they outscored St. John's 15-7. Jared Rhoden added 19 points and a career-high 16 rebounds to help Seton Hall reach the semifinals for the fifth time in seven years. Myles Cale contributed 16 points and eight rebounds for the Pirates, who shot 41.7 percent overall and hit nine of their 12 free throws in the extra period. Julian Champagnie scored 16 points but shot 7 of 21 from the floor for St. John's (16-11), which may have hurt its chances at an NCAA bid by shooting 32.9 percent and missing seven of nine shots in overtime. Rasheem Dunn added 15 points while Greg Williams Jr. and Marcellus Earlington contributed 12 apiece for the Red Storm. Mamukelashvili added 11 rebounds and four assists while shooting 7 of 20 from the field. He missed his final seven shots -- including two jumpers in the final six seconds of regulation -- but came up with two clutch plays to help Seton Hall survive. The Pirates held a 68-64 lead when Mamukelashvili blocked a corner 3-pointer try by Marcellus Earlington with 2:12 left. After Rhoden grabbed the rebound, he connected with Cale on a layup that made it 70-64 with 1:47 remaining. Seton Hall held a 60-57 lead on a free throw by Mamukelashvili with 2:20 remaining in regulation, but Earlington's open 3-pointer forged a 60-60 tie 20 seconds later. After Dunn hit two free throws with 66 seconds left for a 62-60 edge, Cale tied it on a layup with 54 seconds left and Mamukelashvili missed two jumpers in the lane during the final six seconds to force overtime. Seton Hall took a 31-22 lead on a layup by Mamukelashvili with 5:36 remaining in the first half but St. John's countered with a 10-0 run before Seton Hall took a 33-32 lead on a dunk by Ike Obiagu with 19 seconds remaining The half ended when Dunn missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, March 11 (Reuters) - Brazil's real on Thursday rallied 2% against the dollar, boosted by another round of central bank intervention in the swaps market and inflation data that analysts said sets the seal on an interest rate increase next week. February's 5.2% annual inflation rate was higher than expected and well above the central bank's year-end target of 3.75%, cementing expectations it will raise its benchmark Selic lending rate by 50 basis points next week and adding fuel to the real's rally in recent days. With global market sentiment also positive, the real jumped 2% to close at 5.54 per dollar. The currency is on course for its best week in more than three months. The central bank's $1 billion sale of foreign exchange swaps followed two separate interventions on Wednesday, one a $1 billion sale of FX swaps and the other a $405 million spot market sale. After the market had closed, the central bank said it will sell up to $750 million of FX swaps on Friday. Sergio Goldenstein, strategist at OHMResearch and a former central bank director, believes inflation and fiscal risks have forced the central bank into taking an active policy of pushing the dollar lower. \"The central bank has finally decided to 'break' those long of the dollar, pushing it lower,\" he tweeted late on Wednesday. \"This puts long speculative or hedge dollar positions at risk, and attempts to avert or mitigate a negative spiral.\" The bank's FX swaps intervention this year now stands at $7 billion. It has also sold $5.58 billion in the FX spot market, all in the last few weeks. This comes as the prospect of higher interest rates is also injecting some life back into the real. \"The market is pricing 50 basis points hike at the next meeting, followed by more hikes down the road,\" said Agustin Sicouly, head of Latin American currency trading at Barclays. \"It (higher rates) will give the currency some carry and yield,\" he said.

        "full article": "The preseason expectations Wichita State easily exceeded as the champion of the American Athletic Conference already make the Shockers a presumptive lock for the NCAA Tournament. So, the AAC tournament is an opportunity to add another trophy that only a select few figured Wichita State (15-4) would acquire this season. The top-seeded Shockers carry a seven-game winning streak into the quarterfinal round Friday against South Florida (9-12) at Fort Worth, Texas. South Florida advanced from Thursday's first-round session by edging Temple 73-71 behind a game-high 23 points from David Collins. \"We don't have to make it to the championship game, but hopefully we can,\" said Wichita State coach Isaac Brown, whose team clinched the AAC regular-season title with an 80-63 win over South Florida on Saturday. \"We're going down there for one thing -- and that's to win it.\" The season has already taken on storybook proportions for Brown, who became interim coach after Gregg Marshall's 10-year tenure and 331-121 run ended following allegations he verbally and physically abused players and staff. Brown, an assistant under Marshall, accepted a difficult challenge created by the offseason turmoil, which included the departure of six players. He then directed the pursuit of a regular-season league title that led to his promotion as full-time coach and AAC Coach of the Year honors. \"We first got the job and just wanted to keep these guys together,\" Brown said. \"We tried to make them play as a unit, play as one, and get them to believe in the coaching staff. That was the main thing right there, getting those veteran guys to believe in us.\" Guard Tyson Etienne not only showed off the shooting form he displayed a season earlier, but also developed into a versatile offensive threat by improving off the bounce. He averaged 17.1 points and 3.1 made 3s, sharing the AAC's Co-Player of the Year award with Houston's Quentin Grimes. \"I think the growth in my game came from an internal place,\" said Etienne, \"and building the confidence and building belief in myself just knowing I am what I believe I am.\" The Shockers will be without two unnamed players at the AAC tournament because of COVID-19 protocols. The Wichita Eagle reported those players are Trevin Wade (2.1 points per game) and Jaden Seymour (1.8 points). Also, Josaphat Bilau (knee) and Isaiah Poor Bear-Chandler (ankle) are dealing with injuries. South Florida committed only seven turnovers while earning its first AAC tournament win since 2016. In addition to Collins' output, Michael Durr added a double-double with 11 points and 11 rebounds. \"Five of those seven (turnovers) were in transition, so we were aggressive making plays and I'm fine with that,\" Bulls coach Brian Gregory said. \"That's a key going into (Friday), taking care of the basketball and getting shots up on the rim.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "PIRAEUS, Greece, March 11 (Reuters) - Arsenal took a big step towards reaching the Europa League quarter-finals when Martin Odegaard scored his first goal for the club in a 3-1 win at Olympiakos in the first leg of their round of 16 tie on Thursday. The English side dominated the game and earned their victory in the closing stages as Brazilian defender Gabriel and Mohamed Elneny struck after Youssef El Arabi had cancelled out Odegaard's opener. Norwegian Odegaard was delighted after a fine individual performance. \"I have felt at home since the first day, I am happy to be here and feel great,\" the 22-year old midfielder, who joined Arsenal on loan from Real Madrid in January, told BT Sport. \"It is a big win for us, a great result with three goals away from home and a win in this competition is always good. The mentality in this team is great, if one player makes a mistake we react. That is what it's about, being a team.\" Arsenal missed several chances before Odegaard fired them ahead out of the blue with a 34th-minute strike from 25 metres through the hands of home goalkeeper Jose Sa. Arsenal survived when Giorgos Masouras robbed David Luiz of the ball in the penalty area and fired wide when he should have squared to El Arabi in front of a gaping goal. Olympiakos took advantage of another mistake in the 58th minute as Hector Bellerin gave the ball away and with goalkeeper Bernd Leno stranded, El Arabi scored with a clinical finish. Bellerin made amends with a last-gasp intervention which denied El Arabi a second goal and it turned out to be a pivotal moment as Arsenal finished strongly. Gabriel put the visitors back in front with a looping header when he rose superbly to meet Willian's cross from the right in the 79th minute before substitute Elneny scored with a swerving drive five minutes from time. \"We were really solid, really dominant,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said. \"We showed a lot of personality to come here and dominate like we did. The next thing is to do that for 90 minutes and give nothing to the opponent.\" (Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; Editing by Ed Osmond)",

        "title": "Auckland removes all COVID restrictions",
        "full article": "New Zealand has downscaled COVID-19 alert levels in Auckland, marking the end of restrictions from the Valentine's Day outbreak. However, Jacinda Ardern's government has been criticised for making the decision on Thursday and delaying the announcement. First bloke Clarke Gayford jumped the gun on the prime minister, tweeting the government's decision four hours before Ms Ardern's scheduled press conference. \"An inprinciple (sic) decision was decided but its (sic) all pending on final test results today,\" he wrote, in response to criticism from Kiwi chef Martin Bosley. \"Feeling really sorry for all Auckland Hospo having to wait until 11.30am today to find out about moving levels. It's utterly ludicrous. Stay strong, my friends,\" Mr Bosley said. Aucklanders were expecting the shift as there have been no community cases for a fortnight. At 11:30am, Ms Ardern announced NZ's biggest city would move from alert level two to alert level one as of 12noon. \"Once again the city stepped up and did what it needed to do ... for that we say thank you,\" she said. \"Look after each other and enjoy your weekend.\" The decision allows for crowds to gather to watch America's Cup sailing, the Auckland Cup racing meet on Saturday, and for postponed Auckland Pride events. Business and hospitality figures attacked the decision, saying it did not allow them enough time to change staffing and order supplies for a bumper Friday night's trade. Auckland Pride director Max Tweedie said the wait was \"frustrating\". \"The sector had anticipated a move at 11:59 tonight, which now changes everything for Friday night shows & events,\" he said. \"We need time to roll out plans, release tickets, change seating/signage. We didn't get it.\" Opposition leader Judith Collins called the PM's communications \"not good enough\". Ms Ardern said cabinet met on Thursday afternoon and decided to move alert levels, pending any new cases and testing of close contacts - information that was due on Friday morning. Ms Ardern rejected the notion Mr Gayford's tweet was improper. \"I have not seen my partner since yesterday and I really reject the implication,\" she said. \"He has not known the decision. He's known the process which is exactly what Ministers have conveyed in the public domain.\" The Valentine's Day outbreak, first identified on February 14, prompted the government into two lockdowns of New Zealand's biggest city. The first was a three-day lockdown beginning February 15. A week-long lockdown began on February 28 when a new community case was identified without links to the cluster, but was subsequently traced back to the outbreak. In total, 15 people have tested positive to COVID-19 from the latest outbreak. Health officials are yet to discover its origin.",

I want one. Now.         There has been much laughter about Rachel Brosnahan and her Covid-filtering umbrella.

Read on.A new BBC series The Surrogates told the story of Caitlin, who had a baby for her boss, Kate.That might be taking company loyalty to extremes and one wonders what kind of corporate environment compliance allowed it to go ahead.There is so much potential for surrogacy to go wrong. Many argue about the lack of boundaries and how it turns life itself into a commodity, along with potentially leaving children in lifelong confusion about the identity of their own mother.On the other hand, it can bring untold joy to couples who might not otherwise be able to experience parenthood.To want to have a child so much that you are prepared to go through all this says one very important thing \u2014 that the baby is cherished, wanted and needed, therefore already blessed.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m happy to give unlocking a go\u00a0Ping! Another unsolicited email arrives from someone selling something. Knuckle dusters, bath salts? I don\u2019t even look.\u2018Are you slightly nervous about life after lockdown?\u2019 it wonders. And this takes me slightly by surprise, because I realise the answer is\u2026 yes. A little bit, to be honest.How will I navigate the world again after becoming used to the luxury of knowing that no one is going to sit next to you on a bus or train?Or join the throng of commuters moving across the city in smart clothes with neatly packed bags, resplendent in tights and mascara and all the other decorations of civilisation? It seems impossible, like joining the Red Arrows on a ceremonial fly-past.Lucky me \u2014 I do still work in an office sometimes. However, the ability to get ready for work, get out the front door and at my desk quickly and efficiently seems to have completely evaporated during lockdown.These days it takes hours \u2014 and I still leave keys or important paperwork behind.What has happened to me? In addition, we must all learn how to dismantle our pandemic wariness of stranger danger and human proximity.It\u2019s not going to be easy. However, I\u2019m willing to give it a go if you are.",

The package, which will be rolled out over the next 10 years, will invest NZ$1.5 billion for walking and cycling initiatives, and NZ$1.3 billion to boost public transport trips by 91%, Transport Minister Michael Wood said in a statement. \"For the first time we're turning around transport emissions rising in Auckland,\" Wood said. Wood said the package would result in a 13% fall in emissions per capita compared with the previous package and could prevent up to 3.3 million tonnes of carbon emissions in Auckland over the next decade.

        "full article": "March 12 (Reuters) - Insurer AIA Group Ltd on Friday reported a worse-than-expected drop in full-year new business value, weighed by lower demand for new policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Insurers globally have been hit by pandemic-related claims for travel, business interruption and event cancellations as well as reduced demand for life insurance policies due to the economic slowdown. In Asia, insurance firms mainly rely on their army of agents for product sales, which have been dented by lockdowns and social distancing measures put in place by various countries to contain the pandemic. AIA's value of new business (VONB), which measures expected profits from new premiums and is a key gauge for future growth, fell to $2.77 billion in 2020 from $4.15 billion a year earlier, its first annual fall since its 2010 listing in Hong Kong Analysts were estimating VONB of $3.04 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The company said sales momentum had recovered this year as restrictions on movement were eased in its key Asian markets, leading to a 15% jump in VONB in the first two months of 2021. However, last year, the number of visitors to Hong Kong from mainland China dropped 94%, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. That contributed to the value of AIA's new business in Hong Kong in 2020 slumping 66% to $550 million.

        "full article": "A massive asteroid that is twice the size of the Eiffel Tower will pass 1.25 million miles from the Earth next week before being flung back to the outer system, NASA said.The asteroid, dubbed 2001 FO32 was first discovered 20 years ago and is 2,230ft in diameter, making it the largest space rock to pass the Earth so far this year.As 2001 FO32 makes its inner solar system journey, the asteroid 'picks up speed like a skateboarder rolling down a halfpipe, and then slows after being flung back out into deep space and swinging back toward the sun,' NASA explained.\u00a0'We know the orbital path around the sun very accurately, since it was discovered 20 years ago and has been tracked ever since,' said Paul Chodas, from NASA.The space rock 'poses no danger to the Earth' as it will be 1.25 million miles away, which is more than five times further from the Earth than the moon.\u00a0It will make its closest approach to Earth on March 21, visible to astronomers using larger telescopes in the southern hemisphere and low latitude northern regions.         The asteroid, dubbed 2001 FO32 was first discovered 20 years ago and is 2,230ft in diameter, making it the largest space rock to pass the Earth so far this year       \u00a0The space rock 'poses no danger to the Earth' as it will be 1.25 million miles away, which is more than five times further from the Earth than the moon ASTEROID 2001 FO32\u00a0 Asteroid 2001 FO32 was discovered in March 2001 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program in Socorro, New Mexico.It had been estimated, based on optical measurements, to be roughly 3,000 feet (1 kilometer) wide.\u00a0In more recent follow-up observations by NEOWISE, 2001 FO32 appears to be faint when observed in infrared wavelengths, which suggests the object is likely less than 1km.Analysis by the NEOWISE team shows that it is between 1,300 to 2,230 feet (440 to 680 meters) wide.This figure is disputed, with speculation it is between 1,300ft and the higher original 3,000ft.\u00a0Even if it is at the smaller end of the scale, 2001 FO32 will still be the largest asteroid to pass this close to our planet in 2021.\u00a0The last notably large asteroid close approach was that of 1998 OR2 on April 29, 2020. While 2001 FO32 is somewhat smaller than 1998 OR2, it will be three times nearer to Earth.\u00a0 Advertisement\n Despite being more than a million miles away, NASA says it will give astronomers a 'rare close look' at the rocky relic from the dawn of the solar system.\u00a0Under NASA 'Near Earth Object' guidelines, it will still be close enough for 2001 FO32 to be classified as a 'potentially hazardous asteroid.'However, the space agency said in a statement that 'there is no threat of a collision with our planet now or for centuries to come.'\u00a0NASA said 2001 FO32 will pass by at about 77,000 miles per hour faster than the speed at which most asteroids encounter Earth.The reason for the asteroid's unusually speedy close approach is its highly inclined and elongated (or eccentric) orbit around the sun.This is an orbit that is tilted 39 degrees to Earth's orbital plane. This orbit takes the asteroid closer to the sun than Mercury and twice as far from the sun as Mars.\u00a0\u00a0The space rock completes one orbit of the sun every 810 days (about 2 1/4 years).\u00a0'Currently, little is known about this object, so the very close encounter provides an outstanding opportunity to learn a great deal about this asteroid,' said Lance Benner, principal scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.NASA said astronomers hope to get a better understanding of the asteroid's size and a rough idea of its composition by studying light reflecting off its surface.The March 21 encounter will provide an opportunity for astronomers to get a more precise understanding of the asteroid's size and albedo, - how bright, or reflective, its surface is - and a rough idea of its composition.\u00a0   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Is MARS responsible for Earth's mysterious zodiacal light?...

Because of this orbit, when the asteroid makes its close approach to Earth, it will be traveling at an unusually fast speed of 77,000 mph (124,000 kph)         As 2001 FO32 makes its inner solar system journey, the asteroid 'picks up speed like a skateboarder rolling down a halfpipe, and then slows after being flung back out into deep space and swinging back toward the sun,' NASA explained SHINING A LIGHT ON ASTEROID GEOLOGY\u00a0  Astronomers will be able to use the relatively close approach of 2001 FO32 to better understand its geology.By examining the wavelengths of light reflected from the space rock as it gets closer to the sun experts can see the minerals that make up its surface.Certain minerals reflect different wavelengths of light, and comparing them to minerals on Earth can say whether it is carbon or iron-rich.For example, if it is very dark this suggests it is heavy in carbon and may be the remnant of a long-dead comet.\u00a0 Advertisement\n When sunlight hits the surface of an asteroid minerals in the rock absorb some wavelengths of light, while reflecting others. Scientists know which rocks reflect which wavelengths so can determine the composition of the asteroid from light.'We're going to use the IRTF to get the infrared spectrum to see its chemical makeup,' Reddy explained. 'Once we know that, we can make comparisons with meteorites on Earth to find out what minerals 2001 FO32 contains.'\u00a0For example, a low albedo, or darker, asteroid may contain a lot of carbon and so could be the nucleus of a long-dead comet, according to NASA.\u00a0Other observatories will use radar to bounce signals off the rock, allowing them to determine its orbit, dimensions, rotation and look at surface features such as boulders and craters.\u00a0'Observations dating back 20 years revealed that about 15% of near-Earth asteroids comparable in size to 2001 FO32 have a small moon,' said Lance Benner, principal scientist at JPL.'Currently little is known about this object, so the very close encounter provides an outstanding opportunity to learn a great deal about this asteroid.'\u00a0         This is a view from inside the dome of NASAs Infrared Telescope Facility which will be used to measure the infrared spectrum of asteroid 2001 FO32Amateur astronomers in some parts of the globe should be able to conduct their own observations, particularly those in the southern hemisphere.'The asteroid will be brightest while it moves through southern skies, Chodas, director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), said.'Amateur astronomers in the southern hemisphere and at low northern latitudes should be able to see this asteroid using moderate size telescopes with apertures of at least eight inches in the nights leading up to closest approach,' he added.\u00a0However, because of its distance, and relatively small size compared to planets or stars, 'they will probably need star charts to find it.'After its brief visit, 2001 FO32 will continue its voyage, not coming this close to Earth until 2052, when it will pass by at about seven lunar distances, or 1.75 million miles\u00a0NASA said more than 95 per cent of near-Earth asteroids the size of 2001 FO32 or larger have been catalogued and none of them has any chance of impacting our planet over the next century.       Explained: The difference between an asteroid, meteorite and other space rocks An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt.A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system.A meteor is what astronomers call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up.This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere.If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite.Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets.For example, if Earth passes through the tail of a comet, much of the debris burns up in the atmosphere, forming a meteor shower.Advertisement",

Rates remain near historic lows, however. The benchmark 30-year loan stayed above the 3% mark, a level it breached last week for the first time since July 2020. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate home loan rose to 3.05% from 3.02% last week. By contrast, the benchmark rate stood at 3.36% a year ago. The average rate on 15-year fixed-rate loans, popular among those seeking to refinance their mortgages, increased to 2.38% from 2.34% last week. President Joe Biden signed into law Thursday the long-awaited $1.9 trillion relief package targeted to help the U.S. defeat the coronavirus. The prospect of the massive stimulus has helped lift uncertainty about the economic recovery. The government reported that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week to 712,000, the lowest total since early November, evidence that fewer employers are cutting jobs amid a decline in confirmed virus infections and signs of a healing economy. Still, many businesses remain under pressure and 9.6 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic that flattened the economy one year ago.

        "title": "6N: Wales want better show in Rome before France showdown",
        "full article": "ROME (AP) - The words \"Grand Slam\" have been avoided around the Wales camp. That should end late Saturday afternoon in sunny Rome. By then, Wales is expected to have overrun an overmatched Italy side in the Stadio Olimpico. That sets up a chance against France next week to win the Six Nations and accomplish a second Grand Slam in three championships. Successive opening wins against Ireland, Scotland, and reigning titleholder England were achieved by the Welsh as an underdog, but they go to Rome a massive favorite. The switched mindset has coach Wayne Pivac skipping talk about a desperate need for a win and focusing on a need for a more complete performance. Wales overcame Ireland and Scotland only after both opponents were reduced to 14 men, and against England it started and finished well but lost the middle. \"We're not overly happy with the full 80 minutes yet,\" Pivac says. To become overly happy, he's chosen a stronger side than usual to face Italy. There's no rest for the thirtysomethings, and no bonus start for the likes of new backs Callum Sheedy and Uilisi Halaholo. The veterans are refreshed after a week off for a final two-game burst and Pivac is playing all of them. \"The more time we spend together, the better we become,\" inside center Jonathan Davies says. The only lineup changes are fitness-related: Injured scrumhalf Kieran Hardy and worked-over lock Adam Beard have been replaced by Gareth Davies and Cory Hill, whose combined 90 caps have bumped Wales to a mighty 979 total caps, a team record. By comparison, Italy\u00b4s lineup has 236 caps. \"It's about us maintaining the momentum that is building and the confidence that comes with that,\" coach Wayne Pivac says. \"What we don\u00b4t want to do is undo that good work that has been done in the first three matches. We're taking this as an important stepping stone in the building of our game.\" They are building to the showdown with France in Paris with momentum and no little luck. But Wales has also made its own good fortune. The team leads the competition in dominant tackles, turnovers in tackles, and more meters off kicking than anyone else. While Wales has made more tackles than its rivals, the attack has matched the defense by scoring the most tries. Wales has also showed off veteran cool - notably to England\u00b4s dismay two weeks ago - by going its last 14 Six Nations games dating to 2018 without having a player carded, according to Opta Sports. Over that span, every other team has conceded at least three yellow or red cards. Wales' ability to stay composed under fire - a hallmark of veteran sides - should put it in great stead against a young and willing Azzurri. Frustration at frequently relenting under pressure has seen Italy concede 50, 41, and 48 points across three matches, and a total of 19 tries. Coach Franco Smith has limited lineup changes to give the team hard-earned experience, as its record losing streak in the tournament has run up to 30 matches. Smith wants their performance to continue improving.

        "full article": "Terrell Gomez gave San Diego State the lead for good on two free throws with 1:30 remaining and the No. 19 Aztecs survived a missed free throw, layup and two 3-point attempts by Wyoming in the final 57 seconds to hold off the eighth-seeded Cowboys 69-66 in the quarterfinals of the Mountain West Conference tournament in Las Vegas on Thursday afternoon. Winners of 12 straight, the top-seeded Aztecs (21-4) move on to Friday's semifinals, where they will face the winner of a later quarterfinal on Thursday between fourth-seeded Boise State and fifth-seeded Nevada. In an exceptionally tight game that featured 19 ties and 14 lead changes, Gomez's free throws came after Wyoming's Hunter Maldonado had given his team its last lead at 64-63 with 1:52 to play. Wyoming (14-11) had a chance to tie when Kenny Foster missed a free throw with 57 seconds to go, then failed to wrestle the lead back when Marcus Williams couldn't connect on a layup five seconds later. After Gomez misfired on a 3-pointer with still 24 seconds to play, Wyoming had one final shot at retaking the lead. But Williams missed a 3-pointer with eight seconds remaining. The Cowboys were forced to foul Matt Mitchell, and his two free throws padded the San Diego State lead to three. After a timeout, the Aztecs fouled Williams to prevent a potential game-tying 3-point attempt. He made his first free throw to get Wyoming within 67-65, then banked in his second try when attempting to miss. Still down one, the Cowboys were forced to foul Mitchell again, and his two free throws with 3.4 seconds left provided the margin of victory. A desperation 3-pointer by Williams was off the mark at the final horn. Gomez finished with a team-high 20 points for San Diego State, which had swept Wyoming in the regular season by a total of 57 points in two home games. Mitchell, the Mountain West Player of the Year, was held to eight points, but Trey Pulliam and Jordan Schakel helped pick up the slack with 15 apiece. Xavier DuSell bombed in six 3-pointers to account for a majority of his game-high 21 points for Wyoming, which had earned a shot at San Diego State by beating San Jose State 111-80 in the first round on Wednesday. Williams and Maldonado added 12 points apiece, while Graham Ike chipped in with 10 points and nine rebounds for the Cowboys, who had won four of their previous five. The teams played see-saw over the final 9:49 after Foster's 3-pointer put Wyoming on top 52-49. The advantage exchanged hands nine more times before Gomez's free throws with 1:30 remaining gave the Aztecs the upper hand for good. Neither team ever led the game by more than four points. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "An Ohio man who competed in a medieval combat role-playing game has been federally indicted for allegedly trying to kill his love rival with a pipe bomb.Clayton Alexander McCoy, 30, was investigated by special agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after allegedly trying to blow up his foe in Manchester, Maryland on October 30, according to a warrant for his arrest obtained by DailyMail.com.McCoy was arrested on Wednesday and will have his initial court appearance in Ohio on Friday before he is expected to be transferred to Maryland to stand trial, WJT-TV reported.Authorities said McCoy had unrequited feelings for the victim's girlfriend, but had agreed to remain friends with her when she said she did not feel the same way about him.The victim, identified as N.K. in court filings, suffered severe injuries and burns when he opened a package that shot shrapnel and BB pellets into his body.

She told him that she was dating N.K. and did not feel the same way about him.McCoy and S.B. agreed to stay friends but she cancelled the trip and told McCoy she was busy with work even though she no longer felt comfortable going on the trip with him, authorities say.On November 2, cops interviewed N.K., who was still hospitalized, and he told them he has known McCoy for three years and did not think he was behind the attack.However, N.K. told cops that McCoy, 'like most members of Dagorhir, is proficient at wood and metal and may have the ability to have created the device that exploded,' according to the complaint.McCoy's phone was tracked from where he lives with his mother in Ohio to the victim's address and the route appeared specifically designed to avoid tolls, the complaint alleges.According to investigators, McCoy had searched '1994 toyota pickup gas tank capacity' in the days before the attack.McCoy was previously convicted of trying to obtain obscene materials involving a minor in March 2013 and was sentenced to four years imprisonment and is currently on the Ohio sex offender registry.In a press conference on Thursday, Carroll County Sheriff James T. DeWees said the bombing caused panic throughout the community ahead of the Christmas season as residents expected deliveries.'Many in this region may recall how frightening this incident was and in the days following,' DeWees said.'Cases involving explosions often take months or even years to solve. And we're all very grateful for the speed and deliberation by which this law enforcement team put this case together through methodical investigative work and through teamwork.'He continued: 'Everyone here on this law enforcement team succeeded in not only holding and apprehending a dangerous criminal, but also hopefully provided reassurance to a community that was justifiably alarmed after the bombing.'If convicted, McCoy faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for transporting explosives with intent to injure and a mandatory minimum of 30 years and a maximum of life in federal prison for using, carrying, or possession of a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence.",

The bank was first accused of breaching the laws in 2019 by the country's financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC, which led to parallel probes by corporate regulator ASIC and banking regulator Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). In September last year, Westpac was forced to agree to a record A$1.3 billion ($1.01 billion) payment to settle AUSTRAC's claims. APRA said on Friday it had closed its investigation after considering the results of the probe by ASIC, which was closed in December last year. \"Although the investigation has not found evidence of breaches ... APRA remains determined to ensure Westpac rectifies its risk governance weaknesses effectively and sustainably,\" the APRA Deputy Chair John Lonsdale said.

        "full article": "Major League Baseball is set to conduct a number of rules experiments during the 2021 minor league season, among them the use of larger bases, as well as restrictions on defensive positioning. Saying it is interested in more game action, as well as pace of play in the era of deep pitch counts, rising strikeouts and home runs, MLB will have multiple levels of the minor leagues experiment with different changes. \"The game on the field is constantly evolving, and MLB must be thoughtful and intentional about progressing toward the very best version of baseball -- a version that is true to its essence and has enough consistent action and athleticism on display to entertain fans of all ages,\" former Chicago Cubs president of baseball operations and current MLB consultant Theo Epstein said in a release. \"These rules experiments will provide valuable insight into various ways to create a playing environment that encourages the most entertaining version of the game. What we learn in the minor leagues this year will be essential in helping all parties chart the right path forward for baseball.\" At Triple-A, the bases will be enlarged to 18 square inches from the typical 15 square inches. Aside from a safety measure, MLB wants to see if the slight distance reduction between bases will increase steal attempts, as well as what impact it will have on close plays like force outs. The Double-A level will be asked to undertake defensive position restrictions. All four infielders will be required to have their feet on the infield dirt at the pitch, putting an end to an infielder shifted into a short outfield position. In the second half of the season at Double-A, a decision will be made on an additional change that would require two infielders to be stationed on each side of second base at the pitch, eliminating an overloaded shift. Pitchers will be impacted by a change at the high Single-A level. Pitchers will have to first disengage with the rubber in order to throw to a base while holding on a runner, with a penalty of a balk for non-compliance. When the same step-off rule was used in the Atlanta League in 2019, it created an increase in stolen-base attempts and success rate. At all low Single-A leagues, pitchers will be limited to two step offs or pickoff throws in a single at-bat. A third attempt would be allowed if it is successful, with a balk called if it is not successful. At the low Single-A level in the Southeast, there also will be expanded use of the Automatic Ball-Strike System to assist home plate umpires. At low Single-A leagues in the West, additional time restrictions between pitches will be enforced. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By Martyn Herman LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Harry Kane helped Tottenham Hotspur close in on a place in the Europa League quarter-finals as he scored both goals in a 2-0 home victory over Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday. The England captain was in the right place to convert a rebound in the 25th minute and he gave his side some insurance to take to Croatia next week with a second after the break. It was an efficient display from Jose Mourinho's side as they claimed a fifth successive win in all competitions. A hard-working Dinamo, who had won their last six matches in the competition, could have made a dream start when Mislav Orsic ran through on goal in the opening minute but shot tamely. After that Tottenham were generally in command with Kane's 25th and 26th goals of the season enough to make them firm favourites to reach the last eight. The only worry for Tottenham, who face Arsenal in the north London derby on Sunday, was the sight of Kane having an ice pack applied to his knee after he was substituted late on. Mourinho made seven changes to the side that beat Crystal Palace in the Premier League last weekend but there was never any doubt that talisman Kane would start. The Tottenham manager has made no secret of his desire to win the competition, a feat he managed with Manchester United in 2017, and with Kane so prolific they have every chance. \"He is just enjoying his football. As we can see he attracts the ball,\" Spurs keeper and captain Hugo Lloris said. \"(Erik) Lamela made an amazing job for the first goal and Harry was there at the right time to score. His second gives some relief to the team before the second leg.\" Tottenham could make little impression in the early stages but inevitably it was Kane who broke the deadlock, although it was Lamela who was the instigator. The Argentine jinked his way into the area before clipping a shot with the outside of his right foot against the post, the ball rebounding to Kane who made no mistake. Dinamo showed enough to suggest they could be a handful in the second leg, not least when Bruno Petkovic wasted a great chance on the hour when he shot wide. Mourinho made a triple substitution with Gareth Bale, Steven Bergwijn and Lucas Moura all coming on. Bale made an immediate impact with a glorious cross to Bergwijn whose volley was saved by Dominik Livakovic. Kane showed his poacher instinct again in the 70th minute when Dinamo defender Kevin Theophile-Catherine made a hash of an attempted clearance and was punished as the striker took a couple of touches before drilling low into the corner. Tottenham could have won by more with Bale stinging Livakovic's fingers with a dipping free kick. (Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",

The Air Force inspector general said in a report on the February 4 incident that the unauthorized intruder at Joint Base Andrews made his way onto a C-40 transport plane on the tarmac, but did not get close to Air Force One or the secretary of defense's dedicated Boeing 747s. The base, just south of Washington, is where the president, defense secretary, and other top officials fly from for official business. It is also the arrival point for visiting VIPs like foreign heads of state. For that reason security is always tight. Yet the unidentified man was able to drive onto the base and spend five hours there at a food court, in the VIP terminal, and elsewhere before he drew attention. That was despite signs he did not know where he was, and his unique appearance: \"On his head, he had a bright red or pink cap that partially covered his ears and had distinctive balls on top that looked a little like mouse ears,\" according to the otherwise heavily redacted report. The inspector general faulted first a guard at the main gate who, distracted by personal problems and obstructed by Covid-19 practices, let the man through despite his lack of valid credentials. In a second failure, the man walked onto the tarmac due to a malfunctioning automatic gate. In a third breach, he boarded the C-40, seen but ignored by two aircrew undergoing training. After he got off the aircraft he returned to the terminal where his suspicious behavior finally drew attention. Security officers arrested him. Air Force Inspector General Sami Said assured that the man never got close to Air Force One, parked at a distant location and protected by more intense layers of security. The report concluded that the man was homeless, lived in his car, and despite an extensive arrest record showed no intent to do harm. During questioning, he simply said \"he came on base because he wanted to see airplanes,\" according to the report. It was not known if the man will face charges.",

        "full article": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking $3.2 million in penalties from Appalachian coal mines owned by West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice over claims they violated a settlement meant to prevent pollution. Attorneys with the Justice Department filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Thursday asking a judge to order the Republican governor's companies to pay the fine and complete remediation work at mine sites. The U.S. and several states settled and signed a consent decree with the companies in late 2016 to resolve allegations of Clean Water Act violations from Justice-owned mines in Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. The Environmental Protection Agency had said Southern Coal didn\u00b4t submit complete and timely discharge monitoring reports, made unauthorized discharges and wouldn\u00b4t respond to the EPA\u00b4s requests for information. Since then, the Justice Department said in its new filing, the defendants have \"a long history of (Clean Water Act) violations and non-compliance with the requirements\" of the 2016 agreement. The companies have paid $2.9 million in penalties to date, according to the new court filing. But the complaint said defendants have not paid nearly $3.2 million in separate fines levied in September 2020 over the failure to submit timely permit applications that led to unpermitted discharges at mine sites in Tennessee and Alabama. The defendants named in the new filing are Southern Coal Corporation, Premium Coal Company Inc., and Justice Coal of Alabama. A lead attorney for the companies and the governor's office did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

        "title": "JANET STREET-PORTER: The murder of Sarah Everard is horrific but it's no reason to demonise half the population. The vast, vast majority of men are not rapists and murderers and people kill them too",
        "full article": "The shocking abduction and murder of Sarah Everard - who vanished walking home through South London a week ago \u2013 has left many women feeling vulnerable and scared.How could this happen in a busy city, albeit one in lockdown when fewer people are out after dark? Are our streets so dangerous for women that the only solution is to impose a curfew keeping men indoors after 6pm - as suggested by a member of the House of Lords.I hate to be blunt but I, for one, would find my social life rather limited if men were banned from joining me for dinner.Feelings are running high, with thousands of angry young women like Maya Tutton (of pressure group Our Streets Now) taking to social media claiming they are frightened to go out, that men own the city after dark.This weekend, Reclaim These Streets is holding a vigil to commemorate Sarah, and marches will take place in Cardiff, Liverpool and London.         The shocking abduction and murder of Sarah Everard (pictured) - who vanished walking home through South London a week ago \u2013 has left many women feeling vulnerable and scared, writes JANET STREET-PORTER         Officers from the Metropolitan Police laid flowers at the gates of the disused\u00a0golf course and sports centre close to the woodland where remains feared to be Sarah's have been foundThe air waves and social media have been filled with campaigners claiming that 'women are not the problem' telling anyone who will listen that women are forced to modify their behaviour and their clothing to avoid unwelcome sexual advances and physical assault.As with Meghan and Harry, an utterly unique set of circumstances is in danger of being hijacked and politicised by people with their own axes to grind.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Sarah Everard's family pay emotional tribute to their...    Bi-racial high school senior who can pass for white receives...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n After Sarah's disappearance was made public, the police didn't help by suggesting that women who lived locally didn't go out after dark. That added fuel to the argument that fear of male violence is causing women increased mental anguish, that somehow women require 'special' treatment and are not equal to men.Young women say they are routinely forced to plan a safe way to get home at night, using taxis they can't afford, forced to mimic phone calls when approached by strangers, even walking though streets clutching keys as makeshift weapons.\u00a0       Pictured left: Wayne Couzens, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and kidnap\u00a0They plan ahead carefully and alter their routes if anyone is watching,Is this a bit hysterical? It seems not. A tweet asking if anyone had pretended to be on the phone to feel safe on the street was 'liked' over 120,000 times - so these fears are very real to many.They call their defensive behaviour self-policing. But is it justified? In reality the number of violent attacks on women in public places has not increased much over the last decade.That's not to say that violence against women overall is on the decline \u2013 but not, it seems from random strangers in the street.In fact, since the arrival of Covid, and successive lockdowns, domestic violence has soared. The charity Refuge says calls increased by 65% during three months in 2020 and the police say that one third of all the offences they record involve domestic violence.         Pictured: Janet Street-PorterDuring a parliamentary debate on International Women's Day this week, Labour MP Jess Phillips read out the names of over 120 women killed in the UK in the last year. The vast majority were victims of domestic murders, tragically, Sarah Everard's name was added to that list.The violent death of anyone - no matter what their sex or who killed them, is dreadful, but women are less likely than men to be murdered.One third of murder victims are female, and three quarters of them are killed at home, usually by a close relative. Only one-in-ten female murder victims end their lives on the street.So what about sexual harassment and the fear of unwanted attention? The most likely place this will occur is in a workplace or on a night out in a pub or restaurant, or in a residential setting.The perpetrator will not necessarily be young - casual sex is in decline among people in their 20's.One study recently found that a third of men aged between 18-24 had not had physical sex in the past year. Research indicates that gaming has replaced sex for many, and young women prefer drinking with their friends. And then, of course, there is online porn.A new study from UNWomen UK, a charity promoting gender equality, says that 97% of the women aged 18-24 had received unwelcome sexual attention - and 80% said they had experienced it in public places.Their survey was only comprised of 1,000 women, so the results might not be accurate - but catcalling, wolf whistling, and leering remain a considerable issue, despite of years of campaigning and improved education.The difference now is that in 2021 - younger women say they are not prepared to tolerate it any longer.The charity is calling this a 'human rights crisis' - and while it's true that such behaviour is thoroughly revolting and unpleasant, is it on the increase? (By the way, it's illegal and building sites are supposed to have a code of conduct prominently displayed). Does it constitute violence?           Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick confirmed human remains have been found in the search for Sarah Everard but they are not confirmed to be hers         Police search woodland in Ashford near Kent today (pictured) where human remains were found on Wednesday nightWhat can be done? One member of the House of Lords, Green Party Peer Jenny Jones, wants a 6pm curfew to keep men indoors.This daft idea would do nothing to protect women (especially those with violent partners). And, bearing in mind the extremist views of some in the trans-lobby, what would stop men self-identifying as women and going out anyway?But a cursory investigation into street crime does NOT indicate that women are more at risk.Knife crime and gang warfare impact on young people, particularly teenage boys, although teenage girls are increasingly involved.Austerity measures which led to the closure of thousands of council-funded youth clubs removed safe havens and community gathering points for a whole generation.The result is that knives are routinely carried to inflict violence and as protection. With restrictions being lifted, and teenagers returning to school after months of confinement, scores will be settled, and drugs will continue to be carried and traded. The police will have to move a vast amount of their resources into dealing with this potentially dangerous mix during the coming months.Earlier this week, Met Commissioner Cressida Dick held a press conference to reassure the public, stating 'it is incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets', adding 'I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public - particularly in the area where Sarah went missing - will be worried and may well be feeling scared'.         A Metropolitan Police van and a private ambulance at the scene of the woods near Ashford in Kent this afternoon       Police have expanded their presence at the site in Ashford where human remains were found, including a mobile HQ (pictured being dropped into place) and a diving unitAs a Londoner, I've walked home from a night out countless times. Yes, I'm six feet tall, I never carry a bag, or wear visible jewellery and never walk staring into (or carrying) a phone. Those sensible precautions apply to anyone if you don't want to be robbed. In a city where people are hungry, homeless and poor, why flaunt your money?Young women might complain that they are being blamed for wearing skimpy clothing, for drinking too much, for wearing heels and not sensible trainers. I think that's an over-reaction. These matters are all personal choices.But don't demonise men - that won't solve the problem. Sarah was allegedly abducted by a police officer, who could have enticed her into his car by showing a warrant card.John Warboys, the Black Cab Rapist, persuaded hundreds of women to drink with him - a complete stranger, late at night - resulting in dozens ending up drugged and being sexually assaulted.The most horrific sexual offender in recent years - Reynard Sinaga - was convicted of committing 159 sexual offences and 136 rapes against young men, who were rendered unconscious after he secretly drugged their drink.But the reality is that most men are NOT rapists or murderers or kidnappers and pretending that they are demeans both sexes and will only make women even more terrified.",

He beats people. He\u2019s quick and he\u2019s strong and he\u2019s got a great instinct about the game, which is a brilliant quality to have. He has been on an upwards curve in terms of his performances and playing more regularly.\u2018At Saracens, he was still learning and showing some real bits of brilliance. Now he has gone to Bristol in a year that has been brilliant for him and gone through the roof in terms of regular game-time and showing how good he is consistently.\u2018He has always been someone who makes things happen. He has grown up as a fly-half predominantly, then a fly-half who can play a bit of full back and now probably leaning a bit more towards full back.\u00a0'He has always been able to beat people and open the game up. That\u2019s been constant.

Instead, he settled for some encouraging words about Malins.\u2018He\u2019s really impressed us,\u2019 said Jones. \u2018He\u2019s got a good kickreturn game, a good feeling for the game, brings pace on to the ball and particularly playing against France, who are the highest kicking and longest kicking team in the world, the full back is pretty busy, so he will have a big role for us.\u2019Another player who will have a big role is Luke Cowan-Dickie, the Exeter hooker who will start ahead of Jamie George. Jones paid tribute to the Chief who has\u00a0 made great strides of late, in terms of his performances and all-round professionalism.\u2018His power has really come to the fore and he is in the best physical condition I\u2019ve seen,\u2019 said Jones. \u2018He\u2019s made a few adjustments to his lifestyle and committed to being the best player he can be.\u2019         Eddie Jones is all smiles as he takes England training this week ahead of the France clashBath captain Charlie Ewels has replaced Jonny Hill as a starting lock, with a view to taking on the job of running the lineout, which has fallen to the over-loaded Maro Itoje during the early part of this championship. And Worcester centre Ollie Lawrence has been recalled as one of three backs on the bench, with Jones lauding him as someone else who has improved physically.\u2018Since the autumn, he has gone from 96kg in bodyweight to\u00a0 99kg,\u2019 he said. \u2018He is in much better condition and there are other parts of his game which he has worked really hard to improve. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with his progress.\u2019England have been working with referees Matthew Carley and Wayne Barnes in an attempt to solve their disciplinary issues. Part of that process has been practising the scenarios which undermined them in Cardiff during the defeat against Wales.\u2018Handling the disappointment of the game is the most important thing,\u2019 said Jones.\u2018We\u2019ve tried to create sessions to replicate a disappointment in the game \u2014 a bad call by the referee or unfair conditions in the game \u2014 to put the players under pressure. There are going to be moments when they are tested like that. We need to make sure we keep our focus.\u2019On a personal level, Farrell has recognised the futility of protesting when contentious calls go against his team. \u2018You never change a referee\u2019s decision,\u2019 he said. \u2018You can agree or disagree, and try to have a dialogue to understand things, but we are not really part of the decision.\u2019On Saturday, England and their captain have a prime opportunity to prove these vital lessons have been learned.\u00a0          RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       Eddie Jones hands a first England start to full-back Max...

        "title": "Struggling Sharks, Ducks start weekend series in Anaheim",
        "full article": "A pair of bottom dwellers in the West Division will clash Friday when the Anaheim Ducks play host to the San Jose Sharks for the first of two games in consecutive days. The Ducks enter with a minus-24 goal differential, while the Sharks are at minus-22, and the teams showed just how similar they are the last time they met at Anaheim. In early February, the teams also played games on consecutive days at Anaheim, and both went to shootouts. The Sharks won 5-4 in a Feb. 5 shootout, with the Ducks grabbing the 2-1 victory on Feb. 6. They have met once since, with the Sharks earning a 3-2 victory at home on Feb. 15. San Jose also has a slight momentum advantage, ending a three-game losing streak Monday with a 3-2 overtime victory over the St. Louis Blues. The Ducks will enter off a lackluster 5-1 defeat to the Los Angeles Kings at home Wednesday, putting them at a slight rest disadvantage as well. A just completed run of what was scheduled to be eight consecutive home games did not turn out as planned for San Jose. While one game was postponed, they went 2-4-1 in the games that were played, giving up at least four goals in five of those games. Top goaltender Martin Jones has struggled all season, with Devan Dubnyk getting consecutive starts on Monday for the first time all season. The duo is expected to share the load at Anaheim in back-to-back games, and Dubnyk could get the call Friday. \"We're going into a back-to-back situation in Anaheim, and I think that we're going to have to have a couple goalies ready,\" Sharks head coach Bob Boughner said. \"I'd like to think that, yeah, if (Dubnyk) feels good and has a couple good practices ... he's feeling it.\" Boughner's thought process fell just short of a guaranteed start Friday for Dubnyk, but simply considering the move is a statement on Jones' play. The Ducks figure to split the goaltending load this weekend between No. 1 option John Gibson and backup Ryan Miller. Gibson gave up five goals to the Kings on Wednesday, but Anaheim's major issue was that play in front of their goalie and with the opponent in net. Outside of a single goal, the Ducks were unable to break through against Kings goaltender Troy Grosenick, who was starting in an NHL game for the first time in more than six years and for just the third time ever. Grosenick, whose last start came for the Sharks in November of 2014, stopped 33 of the Ducks' 34 shots. He was pressed into service because of injury and COVID-19 protocol constraints. \"You have to have a short memory, but at the same time I think all of us have to take a look in the mirror tonight and think about what we did, how we played,\" the Ducks' Cam Fowler said after the defeat. \"I know the season hasn't gone the way we wanted it to go, but to have an effort like that is inexcusable for all of us. \"I expect us to come out with a much better effort against San Jose.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "___ From job cuts to online commerce, virus reshaped US economy WASHINGTON (AP) - A once-in-a-century pandemic has ground on for a year, throwing millions out of work and upending wide swathes of the American economy. Delivery services thrived while restaurants suffered. Home offices replaced downtown offices. Travel and entertainment spending dried up. The job losses were swift and harsh. But they hardly fell equally across the economy. Black and Hispanic workers fared worse than others. And many women, mostly mothers, felt compelled to quit the workforce to care for children being schooled online from home. After a year of ghostly airports, empty sports stadiums and constant Zoom meetings, growing signs suggest that the economy is strengthening. ___ More records for stock indexes as stimulus bill becomes law NEW YORK (AP) - Broad gains in stocks pushed several major indexes to all-time highs on Wall Street. The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a measure of small-company stocks all closed at record levels on Thursday. The S&P 500 added 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 2.5%, but remains below the record high it set last month. The gains came as President Joe Biden signed a huge economic relief bill into law. Crude oil prices rose more than 2%, and Coupang, the Amazon of South Korea, soared in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Bond yields eased back from their intraday highs. ___ US jobless claims fall to 712,000 as pace of layoffs eases WASHINGTON (AP) - The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to 712,000, the lowest total since early November, evidence that fewer employers are cutting jobs amid a decline in confirmed coronavirus cases and signs of an improving economy. The Labor Department said Thursday that applications for unemployment aid dropped by 42,000 from 754,000 the week before. Though the job market has been slowly strengthening, many businesses remain under pressure, and 9.6 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic that flattened the economy 12 months ago. ___ Lagging US, Europe speeds up help for virus-hit economy FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The European Central Bank says it will step up its bond-buying stimulus in the coming months. The move comes as the eurozone\u00b4s recovery from the pandemic is expected to lag a full year behind that of the U.S. That is because Europe is being held back by slow vaccine rollouts and less relief spending. The central bank said Thursday that over the next quarter the purchases would be conducted \"at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.\" ECB officials have expressed concern at a rise in longer-term borrowing rates, which can hurt businesses as they try to emerge from the pandemic recession. ___ As climate fight shifts to oil, Biden faces a formidable foe CASPER, Wyo. (AP) - President Joe Biden\u00b4s bid to tackle climate change is running straight through the heart of the U.S. oil and gas industry. It\u00b4s a much bigger, more influential foe than Democrats faced when they took on the coal industry during the Obama years. Coal dominated U.S. power generation for decades. Fast forward to 2021 - and oil and gas production have eclipsed coal to become the biggest source of greenhouse emissions from public lands and waters. That\u00b4s made government fuel sales from federal reserves an irresistible target for Biden as his administration tries to rein in climate change. ___ Uber, Lyft team up on database to expose abusive drivers SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) - Uber and Lyft have teamed up to create a database of drivers ousted from their ride-hailing services for complaints about sexual assault and other crimes that have raised passenger-safety concerns for years. The clearinghouse will initially consist of drivers expelled by the ride-hailing rivals in the U.S., but will be open to other companies that deploy workers to perform services such as delivering groceries or take-out orders from restaurants. The safety program follows through on a promise that Uber made 15 months ago when it revealed that more than 3,000 sexual assaults had been reported on its service in the U.S. during 2018. ___ Coupang, the Amazon of South Korea, debuts on NYSE NEW YORK (AP) - The biggest IPO in years is rolling out on the New York Stock Exchange where Coupang, the South Korean equivalent of Amazon in the U.S., or Alibaba in China, will begin trading under the ticker \"CPNG.\" It\u00b4s actually the largest initial public offering from an Asian company since Alibaba went public about seven years ago. And it\u00b4s the biggest in the U.S. since Uber raised more than $8 billion in 2019. Coupang has raised about $4.6 billion, outsizing last month\u00b4s $2 billion capital raise by the dating app Bumble. Coupang priced 130 million shares at $35 each, valuing the company at about $60 billion. ___ The S&P 500 rose 40.53 points, or 1%, to 3,939.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 188.57 points, or 0.6%, to 32,485.59. The Nasdaq composite gained 329.84 points, or 2.5%, to 13,398.67. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks ended up 52.86 points, or 2.3%, to 2,338.54.",

        "full article": "A wearable sensor that detects dehydration is poised to enter mass production in Australia, and its makers say it could save millions of lives around the world each year. The small, stick-on device will be made at a new facility in Brisbane and within a few years should be saving lives in nursing homes, hospitals, and extreme workplaces such as mine sites. It works by examining what's happening in the viable epidermis, the layer of skin that's most sensitive to changes in hydration. A phone app, or specially-designed reader, can then be used to scan the device, producing a real-time indication of water levels in the body. The sensor has been developed by WearOptimo, in collaboration with the Australian National University and other partners. The company says its hydration sensor will be the first of many. Work has already started on another that promises to detect the early warning signs of heart attacks. \"That one is further down the line but the impact of that could be massive,\" WearOptimo founder Professor Mark Kendall told AAP on Friday. Right now though, efforts are focused on getting the hydration sensor to market, first in Australia and the US, and later in other markets. He won't say when that will be but the company is working to a 10-year road map, and the Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles says the goal is for the Brisbane plant to be pumping out 26 million units each year. The state government has stumped up some cash to help get the device to market. Prof Kendall says the hydration sensor could be a game-changer for managing dehydration in nursing home residents, something the recent aged care royal commission said must be improved. \"As we get older our ability to know when to drink water deteriorates. This can become a real issue for older people, because the body isn't telling them to,\" he says. \"It's a significant issue this sensor can address.\" The device also promises to safeguard lives in a vast range of other settings including for underground mine workers, troops in the field, and construction workers who have to function in extreme heat. It could also be used to manage hydration levels in hospital patients. \"Your cognitive function deteriorates as you get dehydrated. Even if you've only lost 1-1.5 per cent of your body mass, which can happen easily through dehydration, it's the equivalent of having a few alcoholic drinks, in terms of impaired judgement,\" Prof Kendall says. \"And that's a really big deal if you're driving a 200 or 300 tonne coal hauler.\"",

        "full article": "Football Index, the online gambling platform, has entered administration and been suspended after a market crash at the weekend sparked fury and disgust from investors.The under-fire company announced on Thursday evening that, after discussions with 'external' legal and financial advisors, the decision was made to help find an 'agreeable way forward'.Administrators Begbies Traynor have now been called in \u2013 with Football Index claiming there is a hope that the site will be able to continue in a 'restructured format'.         Virtual gambling platform Football Index - a shirt sponsor for QPR and Nottingham Forest - has been suspended after the catastrophic market crashIn an explosive statement, the platform admitted the move may see equity being issued to investors, board representation introduced for its users and, more importantly, a new management team put in place.'Until such time as the administrators are in office, the platform will remain suspended and no trading or payment transactions, such as deposits and withdrawals, will be possible,' Football Index added.'Once in office, the administrators will be in contact with customers, creditors, and other stakeholders. This interim step of suspending the platform is merely to ensure that everyone's rights are preserved in relation to funds held by BetIndex Limited.'Advertised as a stock market for footballers, and licensed by the Gambling Commission, Football Index confirmed that activity from users will be halted for the foreseeable future.

The buy and sell prices for the world's top players plummeted drastically over the weekendFootball Index explained that their primary objective when cutting dividends was to 'protect the long-term sustainability of the platform'.Investors are able to buy and sell 'shares' in footballers around the world on the site, and they will receive dividends in return depending on the performances of the players.They will typically take up a three-year contract \u2013 although the maximum dividend users may win on a single day has now dropped from 33p to just 6p.There is ire directed at Football Index's assurances to customers about their strong financial position - which contrasted to the company's 'significant' losses this year.Customers were told that the the platform had, in its five-year history, 'never been in a stronger financial position than today.'Founder Adam Cole admitted to shareholders in an email, which was sent last week and seen by Sportsmail, that work was underway to 'stimulate liquidity and restart the market'.Football Index has also come under fire after the company continued to 'mint' and issue new shares in the days leading up to the announcement that dividends would be reduced.They have been accused of not delivering on several promises by investors \u2013 with a touted expansion into Germany and work alongside NASDAQ widely viewed as an indication of the company's bright future.         Notts Forest are in dialogue with Football Index - their main shirt sponsors - following the crashA Q&A session with CEO Mike Bohan, which was advertised a fortnight ago but failed to take place, also stirred frustrations in the community.Football Index has even been accused of being a \u2018Ponzi scheme\u2019, a form of fraud that lures in investors and hands profits to earlier investors with funds from recent ones.An email from its customer service team surfaced on social media and raised serious concerns that the company relies on new deposits to pay its existing investors.\u2018At the time of communication, Football Index had substantial cash reserves,' it said.\u00a0'However, in the coming months Football Index sustained consistent and substantial losses due to very low deposit levels which depleted their reserves.\u2019\u00a0They have categorically denied that new deposits are linked to payouts, however.Meanwhile, Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Nottingham Forest are in dialogue with Football Index, their main shirt sponsors, after becoming aware of the backlash facing the platform.QPR, whose jerseys are also emblazoned with the company's logo, declined to comment.Football Index and Begbies Traynor have been approached for comment.

        "title": "How safe do YOU feel at night? The tragic case of Sarah Everard has provoked an avalanche of accounts from women who've been harassed or assaulted. A shaming day for all men? Seven female writers share their views",
        "full article": "The tragic tale of Sarah Everard has haunted the nation this week. As a serving police officer was arrested following the disappearance of the 33-year-old as she walked home at 9pm last week \u2014 and news broke that human remains had been discovered \u2014 social media was flooded with accounts of the fear, abuse, harassment and violence that women experience daily.\u00a0The police officer, it should be said, is still only a suspect, has not been charged with any offence, and remains innocent until proven guilty.That said, why is it that women still feel unsafe on Britain\u2019s streets? And are they right to do so? Here a selection of writers give their views...It could be any man at any time \u2014 it\u2019s terrifying\u00a0Flora Gill, 30         Flora Gill, 30The first time I was harassed in the streets, I was 11 and walking back from school in the middle of the day; a man chased me and started taking photos up my skirt.When I was 14, walking through a park in the morning, I was jeered at and pushed between a group of boys.At 16, I was followed back from a party at night as a man chased me, laughing.At 21, while travelling, I was groped in a crowd while my partner walked unaware beside me.These are not the only instances, or even the most serious. The point is they all happened at different ages, at different times of the day, while I was wearing different types of clothes.As women, there are so many things we do to try to minimise our risk. We don\u2019t jog at night, we avoid the top floor of the night bus, we check the back seats of our cars, we walk with our keys in our hands, ready to deploy as weapons if necessary.It\u2019s the same set of rules Sarah Everard appears to have had in mind. She took a well-lit route, she called her partner, she wore bright colours and it still was not enough.So when people ask \u2018What could you have done differently?\u2019 the answer is: nothing.\u00a0Whether you\u2019re a schoolgirl walking home in your uniform, or a 33-year-old in \u2018sensible\u2019 clothes, you are never without \u2018risk\u2019.It\u2019s not all men, but it feels as if it could be any man, at any time, no matter our precautions; and that is a terrifying world to live in.I was assaulted \u2014 but I refuse to be cowed by fearJulia Lawrence, 53         Julia Lawrence, 53The \u2018incident\u2019, as it was referred to in my police report, happened on a hot summer\u2019s night in 2019.\u00a0It should have changed my attitude towards my personal safety and, indeed, that of my 24-year-old daughter \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t let that happen.I was walking home from a friend\u2019s house, a mile-long stroll along a busy road in North London, at about 11pm when I became aware of someone following me.I slowed down, he slowed down. I sped up, he sped up. So I ducked inside a restaurant. When I emerged ten minutes later, he\u2019d waited for me.\u00a0In blind terror, I tried to sprint away \u2014 me, a middle-aged woman, a little bit tipsy, wearing strappy sandals, trying to outrun a 6 ft tall young man in trainers.Obviously, he caught me. What happened next was truly bizarre: he just grinned and grabbed my bum, then ran off.I have never been so scared in my life. To the police\u2019s credit, they took it very seriously. I attended an identity parade where I failed to pick out my attacker, but they got him anyway: a local \u2018character\u2019 who had learning difficulties and was targeting women.My family and friends begged me to be more careful, not to walk alone at night, but angrily I refused. Why should I? I will not moderate what I see as perfectly reasonable behaviour in response to the unreasonable, and extremely rare, habits of others. Would I walk home along a country road, blind drunk, miles from anywhere? No, because that would increase my chances of running into danger, most likely from a speeding car.But strolling home on a warm summer\u2019s evening in a busy area is a privilege I am not prepared to forsake over a threat which I see as minimal. I was simply unlucky.Women have fought too hard, for too long, for freedom to relinquish it that easily.Harassment of women is worse today due to pornTanith Carey, 53         Tanith Carey, 53As I walked arm-in-arm with my 15-year-old daughter up our local High Street last week, I vaguely noticed a respectably dressed, middle-aged man in a mask queueing to get into Marks & Spencer.I thought little of it until Clio said a few seconds later: \u2018That guy just made a weird gesture at me.\u2019Confused, she described how, while staring directly into her eyes, he had lowered his hands, palms-down, from his chest to his crotch, as though pushing something down.As it dawned on me what this meant, I felt nauseated. Right in front of me, this stranger had felt emboldened enough to indicate to my child that he\u2019d like to force her to perform oral sex on him.This is not an isolated experience for my daughter, just as it wasn\u2019t for me at her age.\u00a0But you might have thought that, in the intervening decades since I was a teenager, the huge strides we have made towards equality, as well as campaigns such as #Me Too and Everyday Sexism, would have meant this kind of harassment was dying out.On the contrary \u2014 it\u2019s actually got a lot worse.For ten years, I\u2019ve been writing about the effect instantly available internet porn has been having on our society.I\u2019ve charted how the explosion of clips delighting in sexual violence have encouraged some men to see all females as objects to be degraded for their sexual pleasure.Even if staged, violent porn encourages viewers to be turned on by violence and the subjugation of women. Until we find the courage to tackle these portrayals, women will never be safe.I have no faith in our justice systemLindsay Nicholson, 65         Lindsay Nicholson, 65My best friend lives only a mile from my house. Easy walking distance. But when we get together (outside of lockdown, of course) I never, ever walk home after an evening spent with her. The path is unlit and runs alongside a golf course, which is deserted at night.What woman in her right mind would do that? I take my car, or, if we have shared a bottle of wine, her husband drives me home.Like all women, I decide where I go, what I wear and how I travel based on personal safety.This is not paranoia. Like most women I have been followed, harassed, catcalled and even flashed at more times than I care to count. My daughter, who is 28, and my mother in her 80s, have both had similar experiences.We text one another the registration of any minicab we use and check in after every journey.Nor do we have any faith in the police or the justice system to protect us. A family friend was followed home by a stranger who forced his way into her flat and brutally raped her.He was caught and prosecuted, but walked away from court scot-free. The defence argued that sex had been consensual and seemingly the jury believed him. Our friend says her experience at the hands of the so-called justice system was even worse than the rape. Who would put themselves through that?Black boys are most at risk on the streets\u00a0Emily Hill, 37         Emily Hill, 37\u2018There but for the grace of God, go I,\u2019 is what any woman empathising with Sarah Everard must be thinking.But please forgive me for disputing the idea that a curfew should be imposed on men because otherwise a woman\u2019s day would effectively end at sundown.I feel so sorry for Sarah and her family, but I am uncomfortable about wholesale conclusions about men and women being drawn from her disappearance. In my experience of London, it is not true that the streets aren\u2019t safe for women. They are \u2014 as long as you don\u2019t meet a murderer. The vast majority of us won\u2019t.I\u2019m 5ft tall and weigh less than 7st, but have never been accosted or harassed by a man on the street. But I was hurt once when a woman tried to mug me in broad daylight.Every year for the past six years, there have been 100 homicides in London. The streets here aren\u2019t safe, it\u2019s true \u2014 but for working-class, mostly black boys. Too many women have died, too, but as a result of domestic abuse, not going out after dark.We shouldn't have to dread walking home on our own\u00a0         Radhika SanghaniRadhika Sanghani, 30The first time I learned to fear walking home alone was after a talk we had on safety at my all-girls\u2019 primary school. I was 11 years old.We were told to avoid ponytails (easy to grab), not to wear headphones, make sure we wore shoes we could run in and hold our keys. Over the years, those messages have become part of my life.The first time I experienced harassment was not long after that safety talk. A van driver catcalled me when I was crossing the road in my school summer dress, humiliating me so much I tripped up and walked away feeling like I had done something dirty. Then there was the time I was celebrating the end of my A-levels, when a man took advantage of a packed nightclub to slip his hands into my underwear.Yet every single time I\u2019ve been harassed \u2014 these are just a few of many incidents \u2014 I have felt guilty afterwards. I blamed myself for \u2018not being conscientious enough\u2019, for \u2018putting myself at risk\u2019.Now, finally, seeing the reaction of so many women to Sarah Everard\u2019s story, it is making me think twice. Why should women grow up fearing walking home alone? Why do we accept that we have to do so much to stay safe when most men don\u2019t even have to think about it?I\u2019ve always felt it\u2019s naive to want to live in a world where women don\u2019t have to \u2018Stay safe! Get a cab! Be careful!\u2019 But now I\u2019m changing my mind. It\u2019s long overdue.Women should be safe\u2014 whatever we wearJulie Bindel, 58         Julie Bindel, 58Safe? I will only feel safe when men stop assaulting, raping and killing women. When there are serious consequences for men who commit acts of violence against women. Until then, any attempt to reassure women we are safe, because few are ever snatched from the street as they were in the days of the Yorkshire Ripper, will fall on deaf ears.So long as the conviction rate for rape and sexual assault is as low as 1 per cent of offences reported to police, men will believe they can act with impunity. When judges treat men accused of killing their wives with sympathy because she \u2018nagged\u2019 him, then we will continue to fear fatal male violence. What needs to happen before women are truly safe is to point the finger at violent men rather than focus only on the victims.We need to make it clear abuse of females is unacceptable and carries stiff penalties.But we can do this only if the criminal justice system starts locking up more rapists and batterers.Why should women curtail our behaviour because we fear being sexually assaulted when we go about our business? It should be safe to take a taxi alone, even if we\u2019ve had a few drinks, and no matter what we are wearing. Rather than giving women advice about how to dress or behave, we should be telling men \u2018enough is enough\u2019.And one man's view:\u00a0I just hadn\u2019t realised how bad things wereStephen Pollard, 56         Stephen PollardSome crimes shake the nation. They remain in our consciousness for decades \u2014 such as the murder of James Bulger \u2014 because they illustrate something that plays into our worst fears. It feels, tragically, that Sarah Everard\u2019s disappearance is one such case.Since a man was arrested on suspicion of her kidnap and murder this week, there has been an outpouring from women on social media and elsewhere. They have all made the same point: that for women, fear of attack is a day-to-day norm.If I\u2019m walking at night in a quiet street and I see a woman in front of me, I cross the road, conscious that she cannot know my intentions.But I don\u2019t think I appreciated until now just how unrelenting and constant the concern is that women feel when they are out alone at night. Some men have reacted by remarking that not all men are rapists. I\u2019ve rarely heard a more fatuous comment. Of course we aren\u2019t. But to the woman near us, who doesn\u2019t know us, every one of us is a potential attacker.I\u2019ve been attacked twice: once in the street at night and once in a busy Tube station. So I also look about me when I\u2019m out, and if I spot someone behind me I\u2019ll often cross the road to see if I am being followed.But for a man, the fear is very different \u2014 the fear of a mugging is not the same as the fear of sexual assault.It shouldn\u2019t need to be said that women have the right to walk down a street without fear. But if that right is to be honoured, men need to change their behaviour. We have to put the fears of women at the front of our minds when we are out.",

        "full article": "LAS VEGAS (AP) - Terrell Gomez scored 20 points and No. 19 San Diego State beat Wyoming 69-66 on Thursday to advance to the Mountain West Conference Tournament semifinals. The Cowboys had a chance to tie it at the buzzer, but Marcus Williams\u00b4 long 3-pointer missed badly. Jordan Schakel and Trey Pulliam each scored 15 points for the Aztecs (21-4), who will play Nevada on Friday. \"To play in less than a 24-hour turnaround and have a game plan set against us that gave us issues - they slowed the pace of the game down, they wouldn\u00b4t let us fast break, they ran shot clock, and then attacked us off a high-ball screen or isolation play - they did a great job,\" San Diego State coach Brian Dutcher said. \"I liked the toughness mentally and physically of my team, that we withstood a game like that, that we made timely plays down the stretch, and found a way to advance.\" Xavier DuSell led Wyoming (14-11) with 21 points. Williams and Hunter Maldonado each scored 12, while Graham Ike added 10 points and nine rebounds. \"On such a quick turnaround, for our guys to execute the game plan, to trust in the coaching staff, it just says a lot,\" Wyoming coach Jeff Linder said. \"That game was a great barometer of where we\u00b4re at as a program. There\u00b4s no moral victories. The close isn\u00b4t good enough. With such a young group, I think people saw that we\u00b4re getting better. Right now we\u00b4re playing our best basketball at the right time. Unfortunately, we were one possession short.\"          Wyoming guard Hunter Maldonado (24) reaches for a rebound with San Diego State forward Matt Mitchell (11) and forward Nathan Mensah (31) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in the quarterfinal round of the Mountain West Conference tournament Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Isaac Brekken)  San Diego State, which came in boasting a defense that allowed 60.1 points per game while limiting teams to 39% shooting, allowed at least 66 points for just the seventh time this season. The Aztecs, who have won 12 straight and are the top seed in the Mountain West tournament for the sixth time in school history, found themselves in a tussle with the scrappy Cowboys, much different than the teams' first two meetings. San Diego State won those January games by an average of 28.5 points while holding the Cowboys to 35.8% shooting. Thursday was a different story. Trailing 49-46 midway through the second half, the eighth-seeded Cowboys used five consecutive 3-pointers to stay within reach of San Diego State, which hit six straight free throws down the stretch. The Cowboys, who employ a four-guard lineup to push the tempo, scored a tournament-record 59 first-half points in their first-round win over San Jose State behind 64.7% shooting. Knowing Wyoming\u00b4s tendency to fire from long range - it attempted 70 3-pointers combined in two regular-season meetings - the Aztecs used a full-court press and limited the Cowboys\u00b4 space at the perimeter. \"We expected to have our track shoes on for this game,\" Gomez said. \"Last time we played them they shot a lot of 3s. One thing that coach always says, when you let a team make 3s on you, you\u00b4re going to give them a chance, so guard the 3-point line.\" Despite the effective defensive game plan, Wyoming finished the first half 10 of 22 from the floor, including 5 of 11 from 3-point range. There were 11 ties and four lead changes in the first half. San Diego State hit 13 of 24 (54.2%) from the floor in the first half, but was off the mark from 3-point range, making 3 of 11 (27.3%). The Aztecs finished 25 of 51 (49%) from the field and 7 of 20 (35%) from beyond the arc. \"I think this was good practice for us,\" Gomez said. \"When we run into teams in the NCAA Tournament that like to hold the ball, throw it inside and stall time.\" The Aztecs, who are now 51-6 since the start of the 2019-20 campaign, are in the semifinals for the 14th consecutive season. BIG PICTURE Wyoming: The Cowboys, the Mountain West\u00b4s leading 3-point shooting team after draining 239 shots from beyond the arc, finished the tournament 23 of 52 (44.2%) from 3-point range after hitting 11 of 27 on Wednesday against San Jose State and 12 of 25 against San Diego State. Wyoming\u00b4s 48% shooting from long range was the highest percentage allowed by the Aztecs all season. San Diego State: The Aztecs are staring at an eight or nine seed for the NCAA Tournament at this point, but are hoping to move up to as high as a six seed if they can win the Mountain West tourney.

        "full article": "The 1933 US Double Eagle gold coin set to be auctioned in June  A single gold coin and a one-cent stamp could be sold for up to $15 million each at auction in June, after Sotheby's announced on Thursday the sale of rare treasures set to break new records. The auction house described the 1933 Double Eagle as the \"world's most famous and storied coin.\" It set a world record when it last sold in 2002, and is the only example legally sanctioned by the United States for private ownership. The British Guiana One-Cent Magenta stamp, dubbed the \"world's most famous and valuable stamp,\" is the sole-surviving item of its type. Along with Inverted Jenny Plate Block stamps valued at $5-7 million, the three lots are from the collection of fashion designer Stuart Weitzman, who said proceedings from the sale would go to charity. Sotheby's expert Richard Austin said that \"offering all three one-of-a-kind treasures together in the same sale is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.\" The 1933 Double Eagles were the last American gold coins struck, but were never legally issued as President Franklin Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard.

The stamp's story dates back to 1855 when a shortage of the imported stamps threatened to disrupt the postal service in British Guiana, and the postmaster turned to the printers of the local newspaper to commission a limited supply. The sole-surviving example of the one-cent magenta was first rediscovered in 1873 when a 12-year-old boy found it among some family papers. The 1918 24-Cent Inverted Jenny Plate Block is from a single sheet of 100 stamps with the biplanes appearing upside-down due to a printing error.",

        "title": "Contempt hearing sought against Joe Arpaio\u00b4s successor",
        "full article": "PHOENIX (AP) - Paul Penzone took office four years ago as metro Phoenix's new sheriff promising to turn the page on the problems created by his headline-grabbing predecessor, Joe Arpaio - ousted in part after he was found in contempt of court for disobeying a judge's order in a racial profiling case. Now Penzone faces calls for a contempt hearing in the same profiling lawsuit, this time for not complying with a court-ordered overhaul of his agency's much-criticized internal affairs operation, which has a backlog of 2,000 cases. Each one takes 500 days on average to complete. Civil rights lawyers and the U.S. Department of Justice asked a judge in a court filing Wednesday to hold a contempt hearing for Penzone, arguing he is out of compliance with a requirement that internal investigations be completed within 60 or 85 days, depending upon which operation within the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office handles the cases. The attorneys argued that the the length of the investigations has resulted in lost evidence that makes it more likely that officer misconduct won't be confronted. The lawyers also said a community advisory board set up to help improve trust in the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has said that it\u00b4s questionable whether it should encourage people to file complaints when the process is so flawed, according to court records. The lawyers said failing to investigate internal complaints on a timely basis harms the class of Hispanics covered by the profiling lawsuit because officers can continue interacting with them while the investigations are pending.          FILE - In this Feb. 14, 2019, file photo, is Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone at a news conference in Phoenix. Civil rights lawyers are seeking a civil contempt of court hearing against Penzone for a backlog of 2,000 internal affairs investigations each taking an average of 500 days to complete. Penzone is the second Maricopa County sheriff to be accused of noncompliance in a racial profiling case in which a judge ordered an overhaul to the agency's internal affairs operations. (AP Photo/Matt York, File)  \"In short, when the internal investigation and discipline system at MCSO remains in a dysfunctional state by quantitative and qualitative measures, the plaintiff class cannot be assured that there will be accountability for misconduct that affects them,\" the attorneys wrote. Penzone\u00b4s office on Thursday declined to comment on the request for a contempt hearing. It\u00b4s unclear what sort of penalties Penzone could face if the court agreed to hold a hearing and finds him in civil contempt. Generally, the punishments for civil contempt are fines, though on rare occasions jail time is given to those who refuse a judge's order to provide information or take action. During his last year as sheriff in 2016, Arpaio was found in civil contempt for ignoring a 2011 court order to stop his traffic patrols targeting immigrants. After the Republican was ousted by the Democratic Penzone in an election, Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for disobeying the order. He was spared a possible jail sentence for the misdemeanor conviction thanks to a 2017 pardon by then-President Donald Trump. The 2013 profiling verdict against the sheriff's office led to two court-ordered overhauls of the agency, one of its traffic enforcement division and another its internal affairs operation, which had been criticized for biased decision-making under Arpaio. It also stripped the agency of some of its autonomy over internal affairs. Transfers of employees in and out the internal affairs unit are now required to be approved by the monitor. More training was required for supervisors. And the sheriff\u00b4s office is required to investigate all complaints of officer misconduct, even those made anonymously. An official who is monitoring the sheriff\u00b4s office on behalf of the judge has criticized Penzone for failing to fill new internal investigator positions and has said the slowness in closing the case was unacceptable for members of the public and officers awaiting the findings. In the past, Penzone has said his office made warnings two years ago about the growing caseload. He has said his office's suggestions for confronting the problem - such as allowing a statute of limitations on complaints and closing cases in which the subject of the investigation is dead or no longer working for the sheriff\u00b4s office - were rejected. Penzone also has said the sheriff\u00b4s office, unlike other police agencies, doesn\u00b4t have the option of treating minor violations differently than serious misconduct. The sheriff\u00b4s office has said it has hired new investigators and created positions designed for retired internal affairs investigators, but that low pay and the difficulty for job candidates to pass background checks have led to a small number of qualified candidates. Despite the criticism about the high volume and slowness of the cases, the sheriff's office has said it has been deemed 100% compliant in the first stage of its internal-affairs overhaul and around 90% compliant on the second stage.

        "full article": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - A Portland, Oregon, man accused of killing two strangers who disappeared 20 years apart pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder charges. Cold case DNA evidence led authorities to Christopher Lovrien's home, where police said they found the dismembered remains of the second victim. Police arrested Lovrien, 53, in May after forensic genealogy linked him to the 1999 disappearance - and presumed death - of Mark Dribin, an airline cargo worker. Authorities searching a shed at Lovrien\u00b4s home several weeks after his arrest found the dismembered remains of another man, Kenneth Griffin, who had gone missing three months earlier. Dribin's body has not been found. Lovrien faces two counts of second-degree murder, one count of abuse of a corpse and six counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Investigators believe the two victims were strangers to Lovrien and to each other. The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office asked anyone with information about missing people who had been living under the Interstate 205 bridge in southeast Portland between the summer of 2019 and last May and had contact with Lovrien to call police.          Christopher Lovrien, 53, is arraigned in Multnomah County Circuit Court on Thursday, March 11, 2021. The Portland, Oregon, man accused of killing two strangers who disappeared 20 years apart pleaded not guilty to murder charges after authorities investigating the earlier case said they found dismembered human remains of another man in the suspect's shed. (Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP)  Lovrien, a metal fabricator, was not homeless and did not live under the bridge, they said. Authorities declined to say why they were focused on the bridge and on that time period. In a news conference Thursday, authorities said additional evidence, including statements from Lovrien, indicate there may be other victims, but they declined to provide more details. Detectives recovered DNA evidence from an unknown suspect in Dribin's home and car in 1999 but were unable to match it to anyone. In 2019, cold case detectives submitted the DNA to a private, third-party company for forensic analysis and learned it could be connected to one of several brothers. Police narrowed that lead to Lovrien and obtained a search warrant for a DNA sample from him last year, said cold case lead investigator Brendan McGuire. The results matched the sample obtained two decades before, he said, and marked a huge break in the case. \"Until he submitted the known DNA evidence ... for genealogical analysis, at no time were police looking at Christopher Lovrien as a suspect,\" said lead prosecutor Kirsten Snowden. Dribin disappeared on July 2, 1999, after he called his employer, United Airlines, and asked for the night off for a \"personal emergency.\" Police who went to his home found that his car and other items were missing and found evidence that suggested he was dead, according to a synopsis of the case released by the Portland Police Bureau when it was still unsolved. Griffin, who had been homeless but was living with roommates at the time he disappeared, went missing in February 2020, three months after police first interviewed Lovrien. McGuire said nothing suggests Griffin knew anything about the earlier murder. ___ Follow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus          Christopher Lovrien, 53, was arraigned in Multnomah County Circuit Court on Thursday, March 11, 2021.

The targeting of reporter Taylor Lorenz started a day after the International Women's Media Foundation announced that it was starting a new resource center for journalists subject to online abuse. Lorenz, a technology reporter who covers internet culture for the Times, on Tuesday had tweeted her followers to consider supporting women who were enduring online harassment. \"It's not an exaggeration to say that the harassment and smear campaign I've had to endure over the past year has destroyed my life,\" she tweeted. \"No one should have to go through this. The scope of attack has been unimaginable. It has taken everything from me.\" Carlson pointed out the tweet that night on his show, which usually reaches between 3 million to 4 million viewers each weeknight. He cited her as a privileged person claiming victimhood. \"Destroyed her life?\" he said. \"Really? By most people's standards Taylor Lorenz would seem to have a pretty good life, one of the best lives in the country, in fact.\"          FILE - Tucker Carlson, host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" poses for photos in a Fox News Channel studio on March 2, 2017, in New York. Carlson's belittling of a reporter for The New York Times this week for publicly discussing how she had been harassed reveals both a toxic online culture and bad blood between the newspaper, Fox News Channel and its most popular personality. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)  Carlson was supported by journalist Glenn Greenwald, an occasional guest on his show. Greenwald wrote that someone involved in polarizing debates should expect pushback. \"It's still just online insults,\" he tweeted. \"That's not persecution.\" Carlson and the Times have a history. Last summer, he said on the air that the Times was working on a story about his house in Maine. He broadcast the names of the journalists supposedly working on the story, and they later said they had been subject to online abuse and, in one case, an attempted break-in. No Times story was written about Carlson's Maine house. The Times, in a statement Wednesday, said Carlson's attack on Lorenz \"was a calculated and cruel tactic, which he regularly deploys to unleash a wave of harassment and vitriol at his intended target.\" Fox backed up its star with its own response: \"No public figure or journalist is immune from legitimate criticism of their reporting, claims or journalistic tactics. Carlson, on his show, revisited his own anger about the idea that where his family lived in Maine would become more widely known. He said there is real harassment in the world, but an online attack against Lorenz \"is not it.\" The International Women's Media Foundation said that in a survey conducted in 2018, 63% of female journalists said they'd been threatened or harassed online. Of those who said they'd been harassed, 40% said they avoided reporting certain stories because of it. Lorenz has visibility online since she reports on the rough-and-tumble world of social media for the nation's leading newspaper. She noted, in an interview for The.Ink newsletter last summer with journalist Anand Giridharadas, that leaders in that industry don't take online harassment seriously. She told Giridharadas that she's had a difficult time with strangers finding out about her personal life and background. \"That's been really, really, really horrible,\" she said. \"I mean, I've gone into kind of a deep depression over it. I've thought about quitting my job over it. I hate it.\" On Twitter this week, she posted a copy of one message she had received online from someone who said \"I hope you cry yourself to sleep every night. I hope you take your own life. I hope you live all your days in fear. You are the scum of the Earth. Why are you still breathing?\" The person repeated \"kill yourself\" 11 times. A spokeswoman for the Times said it has \"dedicated staff and robust measures in place to protect journalists\" against the overall backdrop of threats and online attacks. The newspaper would not discuss details. One potential piece of advice for Lorenz - stay off the internet - doesn't apply. Her job depends upon it. Elisa Lees Munoz, executive director of the women's media foundation, offered support on Thursday. \"Lorenz is a legitimate journalist whose work should be applauded, not attacked,\" Munoz said. \"Women journalists must be able to do their jobs without fear for their lives.\"",

Oregon did not miss consecutive shots in the final 15 minutes of the game until the 1:30 mark when it was in front 60-35. The Ducks made six straight for a 41-23 lead and seven consecutive to go up 54-33. Eugene Omoruyi had 15 points and six rebounds for Oregon (20-5), which has won six straight games to reach 20 wins for the 11th straight season. Amauri Hardy added 11 points and Chandler Lawson 10. The Ducks shot 59% from the field, including 10 of 18 from distance - with three apiece from Omoruyi and Figueroa, and two by Richardson. Richardson recently returned from a thumb injury, on Feb. 3, that forced him to miss Oregon's run of eight wins in nine games in December and January. He was coming off a career-high 22 points in a regular-season finale against rival Oregon State, and the Ducks are now 11-2 with him in the lineup.

        "full article": "GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) - Jordan Usher scored 13 of his 15 points in the second half, including a game-clinching dunk created off a sterling play by Jose Alvarado, and Georgia Tech ended Miami's run in the ACC tournament with a 70-66 win on Thursday. Miami's Kameron McGusty hit a 3-pointer with 32 seconds left to get the Hurricanes (10-17) within two points. Following a Miami foul, Alvarado saved a poor inbounds pass in the backcourt as he flew out of bounds, passing it to teammate Bubba Parham. Parham returned the ball to Alvarado, who found Usher alone for the clinching dunk with 19 seconds left. The Yellow Jackets (16-8), with seven straight wins, solidified their bid to reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 11 years and will take on top-seeded and No. 16-ranked Virginia in a Friday semifinal. The Cavaliers advanced with a last-second win over Syracuse. Alvarado, the ACC defensive player of the year, and Michael Devoe finished with 13 points each with Devoe collecting seven assists. Alvarado sat out the final 3 1/2 minutes of the first half after he banged knees with Miami's Isaiah Wong and was helped off the court in obvious pain. He returned to start the second half. Moses Wright, the ACC player of the year averaging 18 points and eight rebounds a game, sat out eight minutes of the second half with four fouls, eventually picking up his fifth and leaving with just seven points for fourth-seeded Georgia Tech. Miami, the 13th seed, won its first two games of the tournament and was ahead by four at halftime but an eight-minute spell without a field goal led to a four-point lead dissolving into a seven-point deficit in the second half. The 16-5 Yellow Jackets run included consecutive dunks by Usher to put Georgia Tech in front for good.

        "full article": "March 11 (Reuters) - New Mexico's Democratic governor is pushing for her state to get a waiver from the Biden administration's pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, she said in a Zoom video recording seen by Reuters on Thursday. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's remarks came a day after the U.S. Interior Department said it will launch a review of the leasing program later this month, a step that will determine whether the administration will seek to halt new drilling leases on public lands and waters permanently as part of its climate change agenda. President Joe Biden, also a Democrat, in January paused new oil and gas drilling leases, triggering heavy criticism from the industry and Republican lawmakers. Lujan Grisham, whose state is heavily dependent on revenues from fossil fuel drilling, echoed that criticism on Wednesday, telling the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce that she was \"clearly concerned\" that the policy had been imposed \"right out of the gate, with very little guidance.\" She went on to say that the state should receive an exemption because of its efforts to tackle climate change. \"Create a program that gives credit to states that are well beyond where the federal government and other states are in terms of climate change initiatives, cleaning up the environment, curbing carbon emissions and having an all-of-the-above energy effort,\" Lujan Grisham told the virtual meeting. \"You do that, (and) New Mexico's going to get an exemption, a waiver,\" she said. She said her staff met with officials at the Department of Interior to discuss this recently, and that she was leading the effort on behalf of other Western governors. The Department would not comment on the governor's remarks. Under Lujan Grisham's leadership since 2019, New Mexico has implemented several major climate change policies, including requiring 100% of electricity sales to come from carbon-free generation by 2045 and a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. The state is also seeking stricter methane regulations for oil and gas production. (Reporting by Nichola Groom and Valerie Volcovici Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)",

More than 30 men are currently facing charges over their alleged involvement in the \"barbaric\" cockfighting ring, which saw NSW Police and the RSPCA seize 71 birds in a December raid at Catherine Field. They'll next appear at Moss Vale Local Court on April 1. Detectives subsequently raided a Horsley Park property on Thursday alongside RSPCA inspectors and located the additional fowl. A man at the property was detained by police but released, while RSPCA inspectors are helping remove the animals from the property. RSPCA NSW chief executive Steve Coleman told reporters on Friday that the seized gamecocks' prospects were extremely dire. It would take time before all the birds were removed as they are trained to be aggressive and will lash out at both inspectors and other animals. \"The prospects of trying to rehome these animals is near-on impossible ... most of these birds, at the very least, will be humanely euthanised once this investigation concludes,\" Mr Coleman said. \"You can imagine, given the very nature of these birds, they are born literally to fight ... these birds were fighting or were going to fight for survival. \"It is an abhorrent, barbaric practice that simply needs to stop.\" Police in the December bust in Catherine Field allegedly found a designated cockfighting area, several large sheds containing the birds, as well as metal spikes, spurs and other cockfighting paraphernalia. They also seized $107,170 and several electronic devices. Police believe it's the first cockfighting ring to be shut down in about 20 years.",

        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - Major League Baseball will experiment with several rule changes in the minor leagues this season, including an automated strike zone, restrictions on defensive positioning and larger bases. The league said in a statement Thursday the \"changes being tested are designed to increase action on the basepaths, create more balls in play, improve the pace and length of games, and reduce player injuries.\" The league's automatic ball-strike system will be used at some Low-A Southeast League games, the closest that computer umpires have come to the majors. ABS has already been used in the independent Atlantic League and the Arizona Fall League. It got mixed reviews from players, with complaints about how the TrackMan system grades breaking pitches down in the zone. Infielders at Double-A will have to keep both feet in the infield at the start of every play. While a defensive team must have at least four players within the outer boundary of the infield dirt, there won't be a ban on shifting three or more defenders to either side of second base, although the league may experiment with such a rule pending results of the initial experiment. Triple-A is getting larger bases, expanding first, second and third from 15 by 15 inches to 18 by 18. MLB said it hopes to reduce player injuries and collisions, and also that the shortened distance between bases should \"have a modest impact\" increasing stolen baes and infield hits. New York Yankees first baseman Luke Voit said called the experiment \"stupid.\"          FILE - In this May 7, 2019, file photo, a new official Pacific Coast League baseball, left, is seen beside a baseball from the previous year in Papillion, Neb. Major League Baseball has reorganized its minor leagues in a 120-team regional alignment, MLB announced, Friday, Feb. 12, 2021. The leagues have not yet been named and Major league owners, Commissioner Rob Manfred and his staff have not decided whether to retain the traditional names of the leagues, such as Pacific Coast League. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)  \"The game's been played with 90 feet bases forever, so I don't think they need to change that,\" the 2020 home run champion said Friday. He also thinks defense shifts are smart. \"In my opinion, you got to adapt in this game, and if you don't adapt, you find your way out of it,\" he said. \"If you got to hit the ball to the opposite field or try to find to do something different with your approach, then change it. I think a lot of guys get content, and they find their way out of the game. ... It's worked for a lot of teams, an awful lot of teams that usually wouldn't be around in the playoffs every year.\" Pitchers at the lower levels will also be restricted in their ability to hold baserunners. At all High-A levels, pitchers will have to fully disengage from the rubber prior to throwing to a base under penalty of a balk. The rule will eliminate the most effective style of pickoff move used by left-handed pitchers - perhaps most effectively by Steve Carlton and Andy Pettitte. In all Low-A leagues, pitchers will be limited to two step offs or pickoff attempts per plate appearance with at least one runner on base. Pitchers may attempt a third pickoff in the same plate appearance, but if the runner returns safely to his base, the pitcher will be charged with a balk. MLB says it will consider limiting pitchers to one step off or pickoff per plate appearance, pending the results of the initial experiment. \"We are listening to our fans,\" said Michael Hill, MLB senior vice president of on-field operations. \"This effort is an important step towards bringing to life rules changes aimed at creating more action and improving the pace of play.\" The Low-A West league will also adopt on-field timers previously used at other levels with additional regulations to reduce game length and improve pace of play. The coronavirus pandemic wiped out the 2020 minor league season and is expected to delay the start of the 2021 schedule until around the first week of May. The minors were contracted from 160 teams to 120 this offseason following the expiration of the Professional Baseball Agreement governing the relationship between MLB and National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, which operated the minors. MLB has since assumed full control of the enterprise. \"The game on the field is constantly evolving, and MLB must be thoughtful and intentional about progressing toward the very best version of baseball - a version that is true to its essence and has enough consistent action and athleticism on display to entertain fans of all ages,\" said former Red Sox and Cubs executive Theo Epstein, now a consultant to MLB. \"These rules experiments will provide valuable insight into various ways to create a playing environment that encourages the most entertaining version of the game. What we learn in the Minor Leagues this year will be essential in helping all parties chart the right path forward for baseball.\" MLB also will continue its partnership with the Atlantic League and said it may announce additional rules experiments there in the coming weeks. ___ Follow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner ___ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "title": "Biden's $1.9T rescue signed, agenda now a slog in Congress",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Tough as it was for Democrats, passing President Joe Biden\u00b4s sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue package into law was the easy part. Now, they are hunkering down to push the next priorities in Biden\u00b4s agenda forward past what, so far, has been a wall of entrenched Republican opposition in the so-very-split Congress. It's likely to be a long slog. Popular legislation to expand voting rights, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and develop the president\u00b4s \"Build Back Better\" infrastructure package are all on deck this spring and into summer. But unlike the relatively quick passage of the American Rescue Plan, halfway through the president's first 100 days, sending the next measures to Biden's desk is expected to take many months. Democrats are even considering changing historic filibuster rules to overcome opponents and speed the bills along. \"It will take time to put all the pieces together,\" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., a member of party leadership. Biden\u00b4s signing of the American Rescue Plan on Thursday marks a milestone for his administration and for Democrats who have command of the House, Senate and White House for the first time in a decade. From party leaders to rank-and-file lawmakers, the Democrats are buoyed by what they can accomplish when they hold together, as a united front, against the GOP opposition to Biden\u00b4s agenda. But the weeks and months ahead will prove more politically challenging. Democrats face mounting pressure from within their centrist ranks to try harder to win support from Republicans, especially on the coming infrastructure bill - a multitrillion-dollar investment in roads, bridges, ports and broadband that could be even bigger than the just-signed coronavirus rescue package.          Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., arrives for her weekly news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, March 11, 2021. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  At the same time, the progressive flank is eager to waste no time and take more dramatic steps, including changing the Senate's 60-vote margin required by filibuster rules, if needed, to leave Biden\u00b4s opponents behind. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said all options remain on the table. \"We need a big bold agenda, just like we passed,\" Schumer said this week, vowing to \"do everything we can to get that bold agenda done.\" If Republicans \"won't join us in that,\" he said, \"our Congress is going to come together and figure out next steps.\" The next big test will come quickly, even before the big infrastructure bill is fully formed. The House is rapidly sending the 50-50 split Senate a series of bills that many Americans support - to expand voting rights, raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and expand background checks for gun purchases. Democrats are set to use those bills as test drives to assess Republican attitudes. If Senate Republicans start blocking the legislation, Democrats are prepared to force them into long days and nights of dramatic floor filibusters, like the movie version in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\" Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia opened the door to forcing opponents to stand and make their case in the so-called \"talking filibuster\" - to feel some pain, as he put it - if they want to block a bill. Manchin has been among the most outspoken Democratic opponents of doing away with the filibuster, but he is not alone. While it takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster on legislation, a tall order in the evenly split Senate that would require at least 10 votes from Republicans, it also takes 50 votes to change the Senate's rules. As many as 10 other Democrats are also hesitant to eliminate the tool. The filibuster gives the minority enormous ability to halt action, and Senate Democrats used it plenty of times when they were out of power. But filibuster opponents say it has been abused over the years, particularly as a mid-century tool to delay civil rights legislation, and call it a historically racist tool that affords the minority too much power over the majority. \"There\u00b4s lots of ways we can test that the next couple of months,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. The House bills headed to the Senate are largely do-overs that stalled in the last session of Congress. At the time, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, then the majority leader, relished his role as the \"grim reaper\" presiding over the Senate\u00b4s \"graveyard\" of House Democratic bills. In the weeks and months ahead, some Republicans will likely happily seize the opportunity to give lengthy floor speeches against bills they oppose - as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, once did, reading Dr. Seuss\u00b4 \"Green Eggs and Ham\" to his then-young daughters who were watching on television from home. Many lawmakers fundraise off such efforts, raising vast small-dollar donations. \"If in a 50-50 Senate, we\u00b4re stumped on basic legislation by the filibuster, it\u00b4s just a reminder that McConnell\u00b4s approach of legislative graveyard is going to prevail,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, the majority whip, told reporters on the Hill. \"And I think members are fed up with it.\" The outcome of the debates ahead will set the stage for Biden\u00b4s next big effort, the sweeping \"Build Back Better\" infrastructure plan that\u00b4s already taking shape in public committee hearings and private conversations on and off Capitol Hill. Along with the infrastructure investment, it could include vast new policy changes - on green energy and immigration - and even make some of the just-passed COVID assistance like child tax credits permanent. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., said he expects it to roll out by the end of summer or possibly in the fall. Still, Biden's infrastructure package may be one bill that could win over Republican support. Road- and bridge-building legislation has a long history of bipartisan support from lawmakers who need to deliver investments back home. If the House and Senate allow lawmakers to request earmarked funds for specific needs, a topic also under discussion, that could also boost backing. But the bill is likely to be vast, and the other provisions on climate change or immigration may drive Republicans away. McConnell has warned Democrats off the go-it-alone strategy. Doubting bipartisanship will emerge, there is growing support among Democratic senators to do away with the filibuster if Republicans use it to block Biden's bills. \"If Mitch McConnell continues to be totally an obstructionist, and he wants to use the 60 votes to stymie everything that President Biden wants to do and that the Democrats want to do, that will actually help people\" by making it clear that Democrats will need to get rid of the filibuster, said Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. \"We may not be quite there yet,\" said the senator, whose own views have shifted to now favoring eliminating the tool. \"I am.\"          Rep.

        "title": "Hovland has an even-par score, uneven day with rulings",
        "full article": "PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Viktor Hovland made a pair of double bogeys Thursday in The Players Championship, both involving the rules, neither of which was cut-and-dried. Hovland hit into the water with his second shot on the par-5 11th that he saw land in the grass and bounce to the right into the hazard. He wanted to be sure, but it's such a small area, he decided to call in the rules official. They looked at video, most likely the camera behind the green, and footage appeared to show it hit the wood plank before going into the water. The wood is beyond the hazard line. \"I was 100% confident it did not hit the wood, but in that situation, you have to be 100% certain, and when he said that video footage was not 100% decisive, then I didn't really have much more of a say,\" Hovland said. He was prepared to drop behind the water, instead of next to where the ball bounced into the water, when a crew from PGA Tour Live confirmed it landed in the grass before the water. He was able to drop 50 yards from the hole. \"It didn't really help me out because I ended up hitting it over the green,\" Hovland said.          Viktor Hovland, of Norway, hits a shot from the cart path off the 16th fairway during the third round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament Saturday, March 6, 2021, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)  The other double bogey was a result of his own memory, and honesty. He had chipped up to 4 feet on the 15th hole, marked his ball and then moved the marker a putter length away to get out of the line of Justin Thomas. When he returned the mark, Hovland measured the putter length the wrong direction - even further away from his original spot. Only after the round did he realize his mistake and notified rules officials. He was docked a two-shot penalty for playing from the wrong spot, turning his 70 into a 72. MAJOR STREAK Sergio Garcia heads to the Masters next week starting another streak that won't be nearly as long. He had played in 84 consecutive majors dating to the 1999 British Open when he missed the Masters after testing positive for the coronavirus. It was a reminder for Garcia to be limit risks, and it makes his a little edgy to have fans around. \"I'm not too much of a record kind of guy, but it was nice to have that streak going,\" he said. \"I think I was quite close to catching up with Tom Watson as second most all time.\" Watson played 87 in a row from the 1974 PGA Championship through the 1996 U.S. Open. Jack Nicklaus holds the record of 146 in a row. \"If I had to miss any Masters, that probably was the one,\" Garcia said. \"Obviously playing in November, the Masters is unbelievable, but it didn\u00b4t have the feel that it has in April, for sure.\" As for the fans, Garcia tested positive right after the Houston Open, which had limited fans. He was at the Workday Championship, which allowed members. The Players and Dell Match Play have limited fans. \"I would love to get closer to the fans, but there\u00b4s too much at risk, at stake for us,\" he said. \"And if we get COVID because of anything, we\u00b4re the one that pays. We pay the price. No one else does. So we have to be very careful as the fans come back into our game - which is great to have them, don\u00b4t get me wrong.\" WOODLAND ON THE MEND Gary Woodland opened with a 70 and felt good doing it. That was more important to him than the score. The former U.S. Open champion has been struggling with a torn labrum in his hip, which ultimately led to other problems as he tried to play through it. Now he's on a training regimen that has him feeling pain-free. His one regret was playing last year when golf returned from the pandemic. \"I just played through it and got into some horrible habits and got into some bad places,\" Woodland said. \"It\u00b4s nice to be pain-free and allow myself to do what I want so now I just got to get confidence.\" Woodland is trying to avoid surgery because he said the recovery would be six months. He's had cortisone injections and doesn't want any more. \"Hopefully, I can avoid it with the way I'm training,\" he said. SO MUCH FOR THE HOME GAME Lanto Griffin figures he has played the Stadium Course some 50 times in the last year, mostly during the shutdown from COVID-19 and then again through the holidays. He lives in the area and plays often with Vijay Singh. That wasn't much of a help Thursday in his first official round of The Players Championship, where he opened with a 71. It's the same course. He's just never seen it like this. \"The course is the best I've seen it,\" Griffin said. \"I think it's actually a disadvantage playing here, seeing the greens rolling at 7 (on the Stimpmeter) and ripping it back. You get here and the greens are 4 feet fast. It's not a disadvantage. But we're so used to how it usually is. And then they turn it on.\" Griffin said he was aware of how much faster the greens were during practice rounds. Even so, it was difficult to trust the speed and he often ran it well past the hole. \"I made enough 5- and 6-footers to have a chance tomorrow,\" he said. The good news? He has never made worse than birdie on the par-3 17th. He hit it to 6 feet on Thursday, thanks in part of caddie Andy Sanders noticing how firm the green was bouncing. He also made birdie last year in a round that isn't official because the tournament was canceled.

Tom Cotton, the senator for Arkansas, spoke on Wednesday (pictured) about his concerns                  Garland was confirmed on Wednesday and is expected to be sworn in on ThursdayMitch McConnell, the most senior Republican in the Senate, who in 2016 audaciously blocked Garland's appointment by Barack Obama to the Supreme Court, was among the Republicans who voted in Garland's favor.'I'm voting to confirm Judge Garland because of his long reputation as a straight shooter and legal expert,' he said on the Senate floor before he cast his vote.Several Republicans objected, however, including Ted Cruz, senator for Texas, and Josh Hawley of Missouri.Cruz said that despite Garland's reputation for integrity, he had 'refused to make clear that he would stand against the politicization of the department, which we saw during the Obama-Biden years.'Hawley spoke out at Garland's confirmation hearing to express concern that the veteran prosecutor, whose career-defining moment was perhaps investigating the Oklahoma City domestic terror attack, would not take what he thought was a hard enough line on violent demonstrators.           Ted Cruz, senator for Texas, was concerned Garland would 'politicize' the Justice Department           Cotton said that he was deeply troubled by Garland's immigration stanceCotton, known for his hardline views on immigration, spoke out against Garland on the Senate floor, ridiculing his response that he 'hadn't thought about' whether entering the country illegally should be a crime.'It stretches the bounds of belief that a federal judge who had been on the bench for almost a quarter century hadn't thought about that question,' said Cotton.'Judge Garland also refused to say whether illegal alien gang members or illegal aliens who have assaulted U.S. citizens should be deported, if a judge orders it.'Judge Garland's silence shows he will, at best, meekly abide by the administration's irrational immigration agenda.'Cotton warned that Garland would 'help transform zero tolerance into total tolerance of crime'.The number of child migrants is proving particularly problematic at the moment, and the Biden administration continues to urge people not to send unaccompanied children across the border.                  More than 3,250 unaccompanied minors are currently being held at the border. Lacking sufficient facilities and amid coronavirus burdens, more than 1,360 have been detained beyond the three days allowed by law, according to New York Times data.Nearly 170 of those being detained are younger than 13, NBC News reported.A total of 9,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border in February, according to data reviewed by the network.A wave of immigrants appears to be drawn by Biden's pledge to relax restrictions and provide a path to citizenship for people who are already living here.Cotton tweeted on Wednesday: 'The Biden administration claims they will stop illegal immigration by sending money to corrupt officials in Central America. Here's an idea: Stop illegal immigration by enforcing our immigration laws.'\u00a0Child arrivals have tripled in the last two weeks, but on Tuesday the White House said they would not term the situation a 'crisis'.Republicans are demanding that Biden take action, and on Monday Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, will lead a contingent of Republicans to visit the border.\u00a0Cotton concluded on Wednesday: 'As our border facilities and personnel are overwhelmed by the Biden border surge, our security will falter and even more drugs will pour into our country.'Hardened criminals will accompany the flood of drugs.'Thousands of confirmed and suspected gang members cross the southern border into our country, and even more will exploit the open border policies that Judge Garland will have a hand in creating.'This will fuel skyrocketing violence in our nation.'",

        "title": "Novavax vaccine 96% effective against original coronavirus, 86% vs British variant in UK trial",
        "full article": "By Dania Nadeem and Carl O'Donnell March 11 (Reuters) - Novavax Inc's COVID-19 vaccine was 96% effective in preventing cases caused by the original version of the coronavirus in a late-stage trial conducted in the United Kingdom, the company said on Thursday, moving it a step closer to regulatory approval. There were no cases of severe illness or deaths among those who got the vaccine, the company said, in a sign that it could stop the worse effects of new variants that have cropped up. The vaccine was 86% effective in protecting against the more contagious virus variant first discovered and now prevalent in the United Kingdom, for a combined 90% effectiveness rate overall based on data from infections of both versions of the coronavirus. Novavax shares jumped 22% in after-hours trading to $229. They were trading below $10 on Jan. 21, 2020, when the company announced it was developing a coronavirus vaccine. In a smaller trial conducted in South Africa - where volunteers were primarily exposed to another newer, more contagious variant widely circulating there and spreading around the world - the Novavax vaccine was 55% effective, based on people without HIV, but still fully prevented severe illness. Novavax Chief Medical Officer Filip Dubovsky said the performance in South Africa suggests there may still be a case for using it in areas where the South African variant is dominant. Novavax is also developing new formulations of its vaccine to protect against emerging variants and plans to initiate clinical testing of these shots in the second quarter of this year. Results from the final analysis of the UK trial were largely in line with interim data released in January. The company expects to use the data to submit for regulatory authorization in various countries. It is not clear when it will seek U.S. authorization or if regulators will require it to complete an ongoing trial in the United States. Novavax expects data from a 30,000-person trial in the United States and Mexico by early April. Dubovsky said that Novavax is still planning to file for authorization from UK regulators early in the second quarter of 2021. The UK trial, which enrolled more than 15,000 people aged 18 to 84, assessed efficacy of the vaccine during a period with high transmission of the UK virus variant now circulating widely. The shot's effectiveness in the South Africa trial declined to around 49% when the analysis included data from HIV-positive participants. The vaccine could be cleared for use in the United States as soon as May if U.S. regulators decide the UK data is enough to make a decision. It could take a couple months longer if they insist on first seeing data from the U.S. trial, its chief executive told Reuters earlier this month. \"Ultimately, they have to decide whether the data we can bring to the table is adequate or whether they would prefer to wait on data from our U.S. study,\" Dubovsky said on Thursday. Novavax\u00b4s vaccine production plants should all be fully functional by April, executives said on a March investor call. The drugmaker expects to have tens of millions of doses stockpiled and ready to ship in the United States when it receives authorization, CEO Stanley Erck told Reuters. Novavax plans to produce its two-shot vaccine at eight manufacturing locations, including the Serum Institute of India. If authorized, it would follow three COVID-19 vaccines previously approved for use in Britain from Pfizer and partner BioNTech, Moderna Inc and the AstraZeneca shot developed with Oxford University. The Maryland-based company has received $1.6 billion from the U.S. government in funding for the vaccine trial and to secure 100 million doses.

The 31-year-old reportedly agreed to a one-year deal worth up to $3 million. Ingram made the Pro Bowl in 2019 when he appeared in 15 games and rushed 202 times for 1,018 yards and 10 touchdowns. But in 2020 he was scratched for four of the Ravens' last five games, including two playoff games, and rushed just 72 times for 299 yards and two touchdowns in 11 games. Baltimore released Ingram in January. The 28th pick overall by New Orleans in the 2011 NFL Draft, Ingram spent the first eight seasons of his career with the Saints before joined the Ravens for two years. In 132 career games (87 starts), Ingram has rushed 1,595 times for 7,324 yards and 62 touchdowns. He also has 260 receptions for 1,895 yards and 10 scores. --Field Level Media",

But its efficacy against the South African variant fell markedly when including mild and moderate cases, results showed. The results announced Thursday were from final analyses, following interim results that were announced in late January. In a Phase 3 trial in Britain that included 15,000 participants aged 18-84, including 27 percent over the age of 65, efficacy against mild, moderate and severe Covid was 96.4 percent against the original strain. This fell to 89.7 when including people infected with the B.1.1.7 variant, which has been shown to be more transmissible and cause more severe disease. In South Africa, a smaller Phase 2b trial of some 2,600 people found it was 48.6 percent effective, though the figure rose to 55.4 percent among HIV-negative volunteers. Across both trials, the vaccine known as NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated 100 percent protection against severe disease. Unlike the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, which deliver the genetic instructions that make human cells create a key protein of the virus, the Novavax shot injects synthetic versions of these proteins directly into the body to evoke an immune response. The Maryland-based company has said it hopes to file for British approval of its Covid-19 vaccine at the start of the second quarter of 2021, and to do the same soon after in the United States.",

The word \u2018niggle\u2019 didn\u2019t appear in her story and was used only in the headline.Can a grown-up fashion journalist honestly believe that the sub-editor who chose the widely used, wholly innocent and attractive word \u2018niggle\u2019 had racist intentions? It beggars belief.         An online article by the British fashion journalist Hamish Bowles (pictured) in American Vogue reaches new heights of idiocyMaybe Americans don\u2019t employ the word much \u2013 but that is no excuse since Bowles is British, as is his 71-year-old editor, Anna Wintour. I assume she read this piece before it was published. Has she also taken leave of her senses?Or do they know very well that \u2018niggle\u2019 has nothing whatsoever to do with the N-word? Are they cynically jumping on an anti-Press bandwagon steered by Meghan and Harry?They are reasonable questions because there have been so many falsehoods over the past few days. Several of the \u2018screen grabs\u2019 of newspaper and website front pages used during the Oprah Winfrey interview were doctored to imply a racist motivation where none existed.The \u2018niggle\u2019 headline was one of them. The word was blacked out \u2013 which of course suggests to the casual viewer (who doesn\u2019t expect what is presented as evidence to be manipulated) that the Mail had used some dreadful phrase.Will Nigella Lawson be required by Bowles and Wintour and the new cultural gauleiters to change her name? Must the Niger River be called something else? Should the people of Nigeria hang their heads in shame and demand that their country be re-christened?I don\u2019t mind what Bowles thinks of the British Press. As I say, he is entitled to his view. But I do mind very much when reason is suspended and the truth is deliberately distorted to demonise a newspaper and a blameless journalist.What a grisly week this has been for our country and our culture. Can sanity and balance be recovered? Or are we going to be led ever deeper into the land of lunacy?\u00a0 Now Vogue says 'niggling' in Meghan Markle headline is a racist insult\u00a0By Sam Greenhill Chief Reporter for The Daily Mail\u00a0American\u00a0Vogue was yesterday branded absurd for suggesting the phrase \u2018a niggling worry\u2019 was racist towards Meghan Markle.The magazine criticised a Daily Mail front page for using the words alongside Harry and Meghan\u2019s engagement photo in 2017.It was used in a headline to signpost to an inside article written by Sarah Vine. American Vogue suggested the word was racist, even though \u2018niggling\u2019 means \u2018to gnaw at\u2019 or a \u2018persistent annoyance\u2019.       Last year, Anna Wintour (pictured), the editor-in-chief of US Vogue, was forced to make an apology for publishing material that had been intolerant, as well as not doing enough to promote black staff and designersThe magazine admitted as much, yet went on to level what the Mail called an \u2018extremely serious and unfounded allegation\u2019 of racism. What the OED says\u00a0The word \u2018niggle\u2019 has been in the English language since the late 16th century.\u00a0The Oxford English Dictionary says its origin is uncertain, but it may derive from Swiss German or Scandinavian. It has several meanings in English, including \u2018to cause slight but persistent annoyance, discomfort or anxiety\u2019.\u00a0There is no suggestion that it has any racially offensive connotations.Advertisement\nIn its latest issue, long-standing Vogue writer Hamish Bowles, a 57-year-old Briton, states: \u2018In 2017, the Daily Mail, featuring Harry and Meghan\u2019s touching engagement picture on the front page, saw fit to run the headline from their columnist Sarah Vine: \u201cYes, they\u2019re joyfully in love. So why do I have a niggling worry about this engagement picture?\u201d (Webster\u2019s defines the word niggling thus: \u201cbothersome or persistent especially in a petty or tiresome way\u201d. Nevertheless, the word seemed a surprising choice and jumped from the page, as presumably it was intended to.\u2019Last night Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union, said: \u2018It\u2019s a bit like claiming that a newspaper is racist because the ink it uses on its pages is black. It\u2019s just silly and absurd.\u2019The word is in such common use that it has appeared in The Times 3,687 times, in The Guardian 2,268 times \u2013 and 2,037 times in the Daily Mail.It has even been used eight times in American Vogue itself. Last year, Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of US Vogue, was forced to make an apology for publishing material that had been intolerant, as well as not doing enough to promote black staff and designers.Yesterday the Mail wrote to her asking her to amend the latest article\u2019s \u2018deliberate accusation of racism against this paper and Sarah Vine\u2019.",

        "full article": "Arsenal struck two late goals to beat Olympiacos and take control of their Europa League round of 16 clash \u2013 having almost proved architects of their own downfall once again. The Gunners will defend a 3-1 lead at the Emirates Stadium next week and were good value for their win in Greece. Martin Odegaard\u2019s first Arsenal goal had them ahead only for another defensive calamity to gift Youssef El-Arabi the equaliser just before the hour. Victory and three away goals! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd34 1-3 \ud83d\udd35 (FT)\ud83c\udfc6 #UEL\u2014 Arsenal (@Arsenal) March 11, 2021   Arsenal were rocked but recovered well and would hit two goals in six minutes as a Gabriel Magalhaes header and a fine strike from substitute Mohamed Elneny earned a good victory. Mikel Arteta saw his side dumped out by Olympiacos at the round of 32 stage last season despite winning the opening leg in Greece but will be hoping lightning does not strike twice. Arsenal were back at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium for the second time in a fortnight, having hosted the \u2018home\u2019 leg of their tie against Benfica on the outskirts of Athens due to current coronavirus travel restrictions. The Premier League side have now won more Europa League knockout stages at the home of Olympiacos than the reigning Greek champions themselves \u2013 but they made it harder for themselves than was necessary. Odegaard was again deployed as Arteta\u2019s number 10 but he missed a fine early chance to put the visitors ahead, scuffing a shot wide after being picked out by Kieran Tierney. If the Norway international was guilty of a poor miss, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was denied soon after by a fine Jose Sa save as the Olympiacos goalkeeper tipped his header onto the crossbar. The hosts had started slowly but were beginning to edge into the contest and Bruma should have done better when gifted possession by Odegaard, the winger only able to shoot straight at Bernd Leno. It was a number of sloppy moments for the Real Madrid loanee but he would make amends by thrashing Arsenal in front. Thomas Partey played the ball into Odegaard in a central position and his arrowed shot flew in off the wrist of Sa \u2013 who would have been disappointed not to keep out the strike. Olympiacos were almost level as Arsenal were again caught trying to play out from the back, David Luiz\u2019s pass being closed down by Giorgos Masouras, who then shot wildly wide of goal. That was just a hint of what was to come as Arteta\u2019s men would all-but present Olympiacos with their equaliser. Just like at Burnley on Sunday, Leno played the ball short and into the feet of Dani Ceballos \u2013 fresh off the bench. https://t.co/Fs3ArYThos pic.twitter.com/26Zprq1IAB\u2014 UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) March 11, 2021   He was closed down quickly, losing possession as El-Arabi levelled with a crisp finish past an out-of-position Leno. El-Arabi\u2019s last-gasp winner sent Arsenal out of the competition last season and he almost doubled up for the night, only to see a shot blocked behind when well placed. Arsenal regathered their collective poise and again began to dominate proceedings as their former defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos \u2013 deemed not good enough to even be registered by the club before leaving for Greece in January \u2013 led the defensive drive for the home side. But they could not hold on to take a draw to London next Thursday as Willian collected a short corner and crossed for Gabriel to send a looping header over Sa to re-establish the lead. Elneny came off the bench after Gabriel\u2019s effort and his first involvement was to curl home a low effort from outside the box and put his side firmly in the driving seat and send them into Sunday\u2019s north London derby against Tottenham with a win.",

        "title": "Biden administration adds new limits on Huawei's suppliers",
        "full article": "By Karen Freifeld March 11 (Reuters) - The Biden administration this week amended licenses for companies to sell to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , further restricting companies from supplying items that can be used with 5G devices, sources said. The changes could disrupt existing contracts with Huawei that were agreed upon under previous licenses that have now been changed, two of the sources said. The actions show the Biden administration is reinforcing a hard line on exports to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment maker placed on the trade blacklist over U.S. national security concerns. A U.S. Commerce Department spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the licensing information is subject to confidentiality. A Huawei spokeswoman declined to comment. The initial export licenses were granted by the Commerce Department after the company was placed on the department's trade blacklist in 2019. This week's new conditions make older licenses more consistent with tougher licensing policies implemented in the waning days of the Trump administration. In January, the Trump administration decided it would deny 116 licenses with face values totaling $119 billion, and only approve four worth $20 million, according to a Commerce Department document reviewed by Reuters. Most of those denied fell into three broad categories: memory, handset and other devices, and network applications. Between 2019 and 2020, the administration approved licenses for companies to sell $87 billion worth of goods and technology to Huawei, the document said. Licenses are generally good for 4 years. While new restrictions on those licenses hurt some suppliers, one source noted, they also level the playing field between companies, since some received licenses under less restrictive policies. According to one revised license seen by Reuters, which took effect March 9th, items may not be used \"with or in any 5G devices,\" a broad interpretation that prohibits the item from going into a 5G device even if it has nothing to with 5G functioning. Another amended license was not authorized for use in military, 5G, critical infrastructure, enterprise data centers, cloud or space applications, effective March 8. The notice also says that certain items must have a density of 6 gigabytes or less, and other technical requirements. Both revised licenses say, prior to export, Huawei or customers must implement a parts control plan and make inventory records available to the U.S. government upon request. Companies are placed on the trade blacklist, known as the \"entity list,\" over national security and foreign policy concerns, and licenses to sell to them generally face a standard of likely denial. But Trump had an inconsistent approach to Huawei, opening the door to more sales when he was seeking a trade deal but then coming down harder as tensions began rising over the coronavirus and Beijing\u00b4s crackdown in Hong Kong last year. According to the January document seen by Reuters, some 300 applications with stated values of $296 billion were still pending. It's not clear how many of those have been decided.

        "full article": "For a young, ambitious woman starting out in her career, the opportunity to have some one-to-one time with one of the City\u2019s most successful hedge fund managers was too good to miss.But what the banker and Crispin Odey had in mind when they met at his \u00a37.75million Chelsea townhouse could hardly have been more different.That Mr Odey, a married man whose wife was pregnant with their third child, acted inappropriately there can be no doubt.Asked by the woman in her mid-twenties, \u2018Where is this going to end?\u2019, he replied: \u2018This is going to end up in bed, hopefully\u2019.What happened next would go to the heart of a case that, extraordinarily, would take more than 22 years to come to court.         After a three-day hearing the presiding magistrate found Mr Odey (pictured) not guilty of indecent assaultMr Odey said the woman \u2013 more than ten years his junior \u2013 was clearly \u2018appalled\u2019 by his remarks and got up and left.The woman denied that was the case, claiming that Mr Odey had in fact gone from \u2018zero to 100\u2019, launching himself at her, putting his hand under her blouse and grabbing her breasts while sliding his hand up her skirt.\u2018It was just a full groping, all over me,\u2019 she recalled, describing it as an \u2018octopus experience\u2019.While she claimed to have raised the matter with her superiors at the time, it was only with the emergence of the MeToo movement in 2017 that she finally contacted police. But after a three-day hearing the presiding magistrate found Mr Odey not guilty of indecent assault.\u2018I am an innocent man,\u2019 he said yesterday, describing the accusation as a \u2018horrible slur with great shame\u2019 which had caused an \u2018enormous strain\u2019 on his marriage to fellow fund manager Nichola Pease, who was by side throughout the trial.He said: \u2018It was absolutely something I didn\u2019t want to come out, it is deeply embarrassing and I feel sorry for Nichola.\u2019         Clearing Mr Odey at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court yesterday, District Judge Nicholas Rimmer said the woman\u2019s evidence was \u2018riddled with troubling inconsistencies\u2019 both in his case and that of Mr BarrellWhile the evidence undoubtedly raises questions about the 62-year-old\u2019s past behaviour, how he ended up in court at all is perhaps of more concern.Not only did the contested incident take place more than two decades ago, but when the woman finally spoke to police in 2017, the Crown Prosecution Service did not think it merited further action. It was only after she challenged their decision that Mr Odey, a long term supporter of both the Conservative Party and Brexit, was finally charged.At the time the woman had claimed that the law firm Mishcon de Reya, which famously represented Diana, Princess of Wales, in her divorce, was acting for her when that was in fact not the case.Further, the Daily Mail can also today reveal details of a second failed prosecution in which the same woman accused another City high-flyer of a historic assault.She alleged that investment manager Julian Barrell squeezed her breasts in 1999.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Riddle over 'flashing' incident: Watchdog probes Met as it...    Queen and Prince Charles back angry Prince William after he...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n She had been travelling back from a corporate day out at the Rugby World Cup on board a specially-chartered train with Mr Barrell, who she knew through work, and two other men. She alleged that the group tricked her into raising her arms and he \u2018grabbed\u2019 and \u2018squeezed\u2019 her breasts.Mr Barrell claimed that at most he had only accidentally brushed her breasts with his hands as the train jolted along.Despite herself admitting that the incident was not serious enough on its own for her to have reported it to police, the case went to court last December. But after a six-day hearing the jury took just ten minutes to find Mr Barrell not guilty of indecent assault.\u2018It was a ridiculous thing to have pursued, full-stop,\u2019 a source close to that case told the Mail last night. \u2018The whole case was a waste of money more than anything else. No one who pays their taxes wants it spent on something like that.\u2019 Clearing Mr Odey at Westminster magistrates\u2019 court yesterday, District Judge Nicholas Rimmer said the woman\u2019s evidence was \u2018riddled with troubling inconsistencies\u2019 both in his case and that of Mr Barrell.         Pictured: Eastbach Court in the Forest of Dean, the country home of hedge fund manager Crispin OdeyHe suggested she may have a \u2018vivid imagination\u2019 and that her evidence could have been inspired by the MeToo movement. That Mr Odey has grown used to dividing opinion throughout his career goes without saying \u2013 a Harrow-educated, Brexit-supporting hedge-fund manager he has amassed a fortune of \u00a3825million, earned in part by shorting stocks and shares.One of the most prominent supporters of the drive to exit the EU, it emerged the day after the Brexit vote that Mr Odey had pocketed an estimated \u00a3220million profit when the pound collapsed. \u2018Il mattino ha l\u2019oro in bocca,\u2019 he told the BBC, an Italian expression meaning \u2018the morning has gold in its mouth\u2019.With his flushed, Bunterish-face wreathed in a barely-controlled grin that day, the man known in the City for his love of the \u2018TBL\u2019, or two-bottle lunch, added with a guffaw: \u2018We might have been up all night but I\u2019m feeling fresh as a daisy!\u2019 And that wasn\u2019t the only time that Odey, who once spent \u00a3150,000 on a Palladian-style hen-house dubbed Cluckingham Palace for his country mansion, has cashed in.In 2008 he earned \u00a328million after predicting the credit crunch and as Britain lurched from crisis to crisis post-Brexit vote he made even more. Graduating from Oxford, Mr Odey was encouraged to train as a barrister. But his life took a very different turn when his father lost his job, forcing him to sell the family seat, Hotham Hall, a 4,000-acre estate that had been in his mother\u2019s family since 1720.\u2018I was 23, but I learned a lot,\u2019 Mr Odey said. \u2018I saw what he did wrong and took the opposite line.\u2019 Landing a job as a broker at Barings bank Mr Odey developed a reputation as a talented stock picker. In his private life, things were on the move as well as he embarked on an unlikely romance with Prudence, the eldest daughter of Rupert Murdoch.         Mr Odey\u2019s wife greeted the verdict by running into the dock and hugging her husband. Shaking hands with his lawyers, Mr Odey mopped his brow with a handkerchief and said: \u2018The relief, the relief is awful. Thank you. There were just too many inconsistencies\u2019Following an amicable separation, he met and married Nichola Pease, a member of the wealthy Quaker family that helped found Barclays Bank.She is currently the chairman of Jupiter Asset Management. The pair were dubbed the Posh and Becks of the City. Within years of setting up Odey Asset Management in 1991, Mr Odey hit the big time, earning the title of Britain\u2019s highest-paid boss after taking home \u00a319million in one year.But it is his financing of the Tory party, and the crossover of his political support and financial investments, that has proved most controversial. Mr Odey was one of the biggest donors to the campaign to leave the EU, giving almost \u00a3900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns.He has donated at least \u00a31.7million to the Conservative Party over the last decade, and \u00a3100,000 to Boris Johnson\u2019s successful leadership campaign.And yet, given all of that, few would have predicted that his reputation would have been put on the line not by his business dealings but by an event that took place at his home one evening more than two decades ago.At the time of the alleged assault in July 1998, Mr Odey\u2019s two children were aged just four and one and his wife was heavily pregnant with their third child, who was born that December.Following a meeting at the City bank where she worked, Mr Odey invited the woman back to his house, offering to help her understand aspects of his business further. The rest of his family were out of London at their country mansion at the time.She would tell police of the incident: \u2018He just saw me as a thing, not a person, just a pretty thing that he wanted, so he orchestrated this ridiculous narrative to get me where he wanted and then it was really up to him what he wanted, and [I\u2019m] just so grateful it wasn\u2019t worse.\u2019While accepting that he had propositioned the woman, Mr Odey denied there was a physical assault. Recalling the incident, he said: \u2018We were talking away and she suddenly said to me, \u201cWhy are you being so nice to me and where do you think this is all going to end?\u201d and I\u2019m ashamed to say, \u201cWell if I\u2019m lucky it might end in bed.\u201d\u2018Her reaction was she immediately became very angry. Obviously it was the last thing she had expected me to say. I totally misunderstood her question and she got up and I tried to apologise and we walked in silence downstairs to the door and I let her out.\u2019The complainant had alleged that Mr Odey had in fact launched himself at her, putting his hands up her skirt and on her breasts. She was then forced to \u2018wrestle\u2019 herself from him and run out the door.But he said she had responded so angrily to his suggestion that it had stuck with him ever since. \u2018I remember how impossible it was to apologise,\u2019 he said.Asked if he had wanted to be \u2018intimate\u2019 with her, he said: \u2018It might have been in the back of my mind but not in the front of my mind.\u2019Asked to explain why it had taken so long for her to formally complain, she said that the day after the attack she had in fact told three senior colleagues but that they advised she would be fired if she took it further.It was only after the second, unrelated incident involving Mr Barrell in November 1999 that the woman finally went to the company\u2019s human resources department to report both incidents. Again she said they failed to take any action.Then, in 2013, the complainant emailed Mr Odey out of the blue. The \u2018vituperative letter full of anger\u2019, as Mr Odey called it, branded him an \u2018old overweight man\u2019. It read: \u2018I never would have dreamed that you thought I would find you attractive.\u2019The court heard Mr Odey wrote back: \u2018I\u2019m truly sorry if you felt uncomfortable. That does not turn me into a sleazy old man. I was in fact your age now. Do you feel old?\u2019It continued: \u2018I just think on the basis of one meeting, you have developed a very sincere and bitter hatred which is unreasonable\u2019. The final trigger for reporting the incident to police would not come for another four years \u2013 when the MeToo movement began making headlines. It \u2018jolted\u2019 her into summing up the \u2018courage\u2019 to report it to police. She contacted Scotland Yard in 2017 and was interviewed in London the following January.After filing the report, she emailed Mr Odey for a second time, telling him that she had gone to the police. The message branded Mr Odey \u2018a villain\u2019 and warned him: \u2018You made me suffer and I\u2019m going to make you suffer\u2019, he said in his police interview.It went on to tell him that she had \u2018appointed\u2019 a legal team at Mishcon De Reya in her divorce. This was in fact not the case as she had only spoken to the law firm briefly over the phone.After interviewing both Mr Odey and the key witnesses in the case, the CPS initially decided in October 2019 not to prosecute the hedge fund manager. The court heard the complainant was \u2018crushed\u2019 and wrote to the CPS appealing the decision the following month.In March 2020, a new prosecutor was assigned to the case and the complainant was asked to provide a copy of the second email sent to Mr Odey. The court heard she provided the document \u2013 but did not clarify that she had not in fact appointed Mishcon De Reya.Crispin Aylett QC, defending, said she had done so knowing the case was under review and that the CPS would not want a \u2018bundle of grief\u2019 from the law firm. Four weeks later the CPS changed their mind and Mr Odey was charged, he said.It was only in October that the complainant was asked to make a further statement setting out the exact nature of her relationship with Mishcon De Reya.In a written note to the court, the CPS said the 2017 email played no part in its decision to charge Mr Odey. District Judge Rimmer took less than 30 minutes after the lunch break to come back with his verdict of not guilty yesterday.Mr Odey\u2019s wife greeted the verdict by running into the dock and hugging her husband. Shaking hands with his lawyers, Mr Odey mopped his brow with a handkerchief and said: \u2018The relief, the relief is awful. Thank you. There were just too many inconsistencies.\u2019",

        "title": "No. 9 Ohio State ends skid, holds off Minnesota 79-75",
        "full article": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann didn't care about style points. He was just happy to celebrate again. So were his players. After scoring the first 13 points of the game and nearly blowing a 14-point lead in the final 3 1/2 minutes, the ninth-ranked Buckeyes finally found a way to close out a 79-75 victory over Minnesota on Thursday in the Big Ten Tournament. Ohio State will face No. 21 Purdue in Friday's quarterfinals. \"I think as much as anything guys were excited,\" Holtmann said. \"Disappointed in some plays they made there late, but I want them to enjoy this. They\u00b4re college basketball players. It\u00b4s not life and death and you can feel like that sometimes when you lose a couple.\" Actually, Ohio State (19-8) had lost four straight since winning at Penn State on Feb. 18. And when the Buckeyes built a 70-56 lead with 3:24 to go, it looked they would cruise. But a combination of errant shots, missed free throws, turnovers and one costly offensive foul allowed Minnesota to charge back. The Gophers got as close as 75-74 with 13.3 seconds left before the Buckeyes steadied themselves.          Minnesota center Sam Freeman (32) and Ohio State forward Kyle Young (25) go up for a rebound in the second half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Big Ten Conference tournament in Indianapolis, Thursday, March 11, 2021. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)  While Duane Washington Jr. and Justice Sueing each scored 16 points to lead the Buckeyes, E.J. Liddell sealed it with two late free throws and some nifty ball-handling. Liddell had 14 points, five rebounds and four assists. \"I knew E.J. was going to try and stay inbounds at the end,\" Sueing said. \"He was able to stay composed, not rush a pass and he made the right play to close the game out, so that was good by E.J.\" For Minnesota (14-15), it was another torturous finish. Marcus Carr scored 24 points and Jamal Mashburn Jr. finished with 18 to lead the Gophers, who lost for the eighth time in nine games. But coach Richard Pitino, whose job appears to be in jeopardy, appreciated the way his players fought. They cut that 13-0 deficit to to 24-20 late in the first half - only to see Ohio State rebuild a 39-27 cushion at halftime. The Golden Gophers closed within 53-49 midway though the second half, too, then watched the Buckeyes go on a 9-1 run. They even got close enough at the end to give Holtmann and Ohio State a scare. \"We fought hard today,\" Pitino said. \"We just came up a little bit short.\" BIG PICTURE Minnesota: While the dreadful start doomed the short-handed Gophers, they fought hard. They just didn't have enough bodies or scorers to stay with the Buckeyes. Now comes the hard part - figuring out whether the program can turn the corner and whether Pitino will be part of the solution. Ohio State: The Buckeyes were far from perfect in their tourney opener but showed grit and, at times, why they are a Top-10 team. But they were sloppy, too, and Holtmann acknowledged his team can't afford another 15-turnover game if it hopes to capture the school's fifth tourney title. PITINO'S FUTURE Pitino didn't dodge questions about the possibility of being fired. Instead, he took them head on. \"It\u00b4s not my decision. We all have bosses. I do have a great relationship with Mark (Coyle),\" he said, referring to the Gophers' athletic director. \"If he gives me some bad news, that doesn\u00b4t mean I\u00b4m going to flip a desk or something. Life goes on. Would I love to be back? Of course, I\u00b4d love to be back. Not my decision.\" STAT PACK Minnesota: Tre' Williams had 11 points and eight rebounds. ... Brandon Johnson finished with seven points and eight rebounds despite landing hard on his lower back twice during the game. ... Liam Robbins (ankle) missed his sixth consecutive game and Gabe Kalscheur (broken finger) sat out for the eighth straight game. ... Minnesota missed its first eight shots, including six 3s.

        "title": "Force 'needed to get back in the car' after yearlong hiatus",
        "full article": "GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - John Force climbs on his scooter, turns the key and takes off. He weaves between parked cars and waiting dragsters. He dodges fellow drivers, track workers and fans on his way from the pits to the strip. It\u00b4s the slowest pass he\u00b4ll make all week at Gainesville Raceway. It\u00b4s sure to be one of the most rewarding. \"Welcome back, John,\" shouts one bystander. \"Glad to have you back,\" yells a competitor. Force gets waves, head nods and hat tips, all signs of respect for one of the most talented drivers and undoubtedly the best salesman to ever make a living at 300 mph. The 71-year-old Force is back with the NHRA after a yearlong hiatus prompted by the pandemic. The 16-time champion and patriarch of drag racing\u00b4s first family will make his return in the season-opening Gatornationals that begin Friday. \"I had it for 40-something years and I took it for granted,\" Force said Thursday. \"When it was gone, I\u00b4m sitting over there and nobody cares to talk to me and then you get sick looking at all the championships and trophies. I needed to get back in the car.\" Force reluctantly walked away last summer, opting not to race when the NHRA returned in July following a five-month break. It was a business decision made to salvage a company he built over five decades that had an $8.4 million annual payroll. He looked at the depleted number of races and felt it would be better to sit out than try to give all-important sponsors less than what they\u00b4ve come to expect from one of drag racing\u00b4s top teams. \"To keep it all going, I would have been in trouble,\" Force said. \"And I couldn\u00b4t have recovered. I wouldn\u00b4t be here now if I would have stayed. That\u00b4s a fact.\" Force \"spent a few million\" out of pocket to stay afloat in 2020. He lost about half his 100-person staff at the start of the pandemic. Some of them landed at other companies in Indianapolis. Many of those who remained had their hours cut. Instead of building dragsters, John Force Racing started outsourcing projects for other teams in other racing series. He says his team \"survived\" the pandemic, but acknowledged it is still going. \"I brought everyone back and now I\u00b4m going to pay them no matter what happens,\" he added. \"I made a lot of money over the years and I\u00b4m going to spend it on keeping this thing afloat and to keep my company.\" John Force Racing will start the season with three of its four cars. Force was able to maintain sponsorship for himself, daughter and 2017 Top Fuel champion Brittany Force, and team president and three-time Funny Car champion Robert Hight. JFR continues to search for sponsorship for driver Austin Prock, who remains employed and working as a crew member. \"You sit out a whole year and your mind starts to wonder if we\u00b4re ever going to get back to doing what we love,\" Hight said. \"You start thinking, `Am I ever going to get behind the wheel of a Funny Car again?\u00b4\" Hight had the unenviable task of telling Force the finances in 2020 wouldn\u00b4t work. Force parked a chair in front of Hight\u00b4s office daily and hounded him about the numbers. \"It was no fun,\" Hight said. \"John likes to micromanage. He likes to be involved in everything. He did not want to sit out, but it wouldn\u00b4t have worked for us financially. Now, we're back. We have everything we need, including the people. We\u00b4re hungry and we\u00b4ve got to get it done.\" Neither Hight nor Force could bring themselves to watch races in 2020. Hight spent the extra time watching his daughter drive a junior dragster and got back into trap shooting. Force watched three grandkids race and welcomed another grandchild into the world. He also hit the gym, dropping nearly 25 pounds - so much weight that he had to get his fire suits refitted. \"I learned how bad I was abusing my body,\" said Force, who quit drinking after a series of crashes a few years ago. \"I hated it mentally, but I think this time off did me good. It helped my health. My guys are saying you look like a different driver already.\" The results are evident, too. Despite having not been in a dragster since February 2020, Force turned in the low elapsed time during Funny Car testing last week in West Palm Beach. Hight posted the top speed in the class, and Brittany Force notched the best Top Fuel pass. \"I didn\u00b4t know if we would come out here and stink,\" John Force said. \"Up to now, we look OK.\" The real passes begin Friday in front of a reduced-capacity crowd, quite possibly the smallest one Force has raced in front of during his storied career. Regardless how many show up, he\u00b4s looking forward to it after spending the past year feeling like he let everyone around him down. \"I\u00b4m just thankful to be back here and doing what I love,\" he said. ___ More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

He claimed the Government were \u2018out of touch and out of ideas.\u2019\u00a0What were his ideas? We didn\u2019t hear many outside increasing pay for NHS workers. Pretty much his entire monologue was devoted to it. Hardly an issue for local politics but, hey ho, there was a pandemic to exploit. Starmer offered up that time-honoured electoral choice: change or more of the same? He slammed the Government for raising taxes.

        "full article": "Steven Gerrard hopes he can persuade Allan McGregor to sign on for another year after hailing the \u201cworld-class\u201d stop which has kept Rangers on track for the Europa League quarter-finals. The newly-crowned Scottish champions looked to be suffering from a hangover following their boozy title celebrations over the weekend as they fell behind to an early Slavia Prague strike in the Czech capital. But Filip Helander\u2019s tap-in handed Gers a precious away goal before veteran stopper McGregor pulled off his latest wonder save to keep out a Lukas Masopust header in the final minute. \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/uOOESD3B0S\u2014 Rangers Football Club (@RangersFC) March 11, 2021   The 1-1 draw means Gers can continue to dream of the last eight ahead of next week\u2019s second leg in Glasgow. But Gerrard is also hoping McGregor will be around next season to help lead Rangers\u2019 Champions League bid. The 39-year-old is out of contract in the summer, but with the title race now at an end, Gers are set to step up their attempts to tie him down for another season. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken about it before, how much we rate Allan, how much we love him here, how much we want to carry on,\u201d said Gerrard. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019ve told you guys I will respect him. He knows what\u2019s on the table. He\u2019s in discussions with the club and, from where I\u2019m sitting, I just hope we get it over the line and sign him up for another year because he is more than capable. \u201cI know that on a daily basis by working with him and watching him closely. The decision is going to be down to Allan, not us. Because we certainly want him. \u201cI thought there were a few big, pivotal moments in the game and opportunities for both sides to get the winner. \u201cAllan has come big for us again and it is a top, top save to get it back and drag it back into his grasp. It was another world-class save.\u201d The Light Blues looked a little green around the gills after their wild weekend and suffered an early sickener as Nicolae Stanciu fired home with a sensational opener to the delight of 300 Czech front-line workers handed entry to the Eden Arena. But gradually the colour returned to Gers\u2019 cheeks and they levelled nine minutes before the break when Ianis Hagi refused to give up on a lost cause from a Borna Barisic free-kick, hooking a loose ball back off the by-line for Helander to tap home from a yard out. Gers grew in confidence after the break and had a few chances to claim a win. But they had McGregor to thank for saving the draw against a Slavia outfit who \u2013 like Gers \u2013 are unbeaten in their domestic league this term. Gerrard added: \u201cI think it was a fair result and I think we have given everything tonight from a physical point of view after the week that we have had. \u201cThis was probably the toughest opposition that we could have faced because they play at a real high intensity and they are a powerful team that came out of the blocks extremely quickly. \u201cAfter a poor start, or a slow start, I thought we did ever so well to get back in the game and we have had some chances, they have had some chances and I think overall it is a fair result that sets us up for next week. \u201cIt was a decent delivery and it is about who reacts the quickest. Ianis has gambled. You expect one of your attacking players to go and score but it was big, super Fil, the prolific centre-half from Sweden. \u201cListen, at this stage it is very difficult to get results. You only have to look at Scottish history to be aware of that. \u201cWe were coming up against a team with a fantastic home record, domestically unbeaten. So we knew the challenge was very big against a powerful team who like to play at a high intensity. \u201cWe needed to be ready for that, but after the week we had it was quite tough. Credit to the players, they rolled their sleeves up and dug in.\u201d",

        "full article": "Harry Kane\u2019s sensational season continued as his two goals put Tottenham on course for the Europa League quarter-finals as they beat Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 in the last-16 first leg. The England captain is having one of his most productive campaigns and took his tally to 26 goals in 37 appearances, while also contributing 16 assists. A strike in either half against the Croatians justified Jose Mourinho\u2019s decision to select his main striker, despite the north London derby being just 72 hours away, and he equalled a club record of eight European goals in a single season set by Martin Chivers twice and Martin Peters. \ud835\uddd9\ud835\udde8\ud835\udddf\ud835\udddf-\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8 \u23f1 Job half done.

Spurs still have work to do in the Croatian capital, but the result here makes their task easier and the last eight is looming. Dinamo arrived in north London on the back of an eight-game winning run and they were a clear step up from the standard of opposition Spurs have previously faced in this competition. Indeed, the night could have taken a different path had Mislav Orsic taken a golden chance presented to him in the opening minute. A wayward pass from Tanguy Ndombele set Orsic in the clear but once he got into the penalty area, his effort was tame and straight at Hugo Lloris. Spurs took advantage of their let-off and went ahead in the 25th minute after assuming control of the match. Kane was the goalscorer but it was Erik Lamela who he had to thank as a fine piece of skill saw the Argentinian ride a challenge and breeze into the box, where his shot hit the post, giving the England captain a simple tap-in. It was Kane\u2019s 25th goal in all competitions of a highly productive season. The hosts continued to be the aggressors but they found clear chances to add to their lead hard to come by against a compact defence. They thought they should have had a penalty early in the second half when Ndomeble appeared to be clipped by Lovro Majer but referee Serdar Gozubuyuk waved away appeals and the incident was not referred to VAR. Spurs eventually doubled their lead in the 70th minute and it was that man Kane again. Ndombele\u2019s long ball found Aurier in space and his cross was not cleared by Kevin Theophile-Catherine, with Kane pouncing to fire home from 10 yards out. Gareth Bale stepped off the bench and almost put the tie beyond Zagreb with a trademark free-kick from distance which swerved and dipped and forced Dominik Livakovic to punch clear. Kane\u2019s work for the evening was done and he was replaced by Carlos Vinicius before being seen on the touchline with ice on his knee, which Spurs will hope is just a precaution ahead of Sunday\u2019s trip to Arsenal. Bale had another chance to completely kill the tie at the death but he poked Steven Bergwijn\u2019s cross wide.",

Jose Alvarado, the ACC's Defensive Player of the Year, added 13 points, as did Michael Devoe for the Yellow Jackets (16-8). Georgia Tech extended its winning streak to seven games and earned a date against top-seeded Virginia in the semifinals on Friday. The Hurricanes (10-17), who were the first No. 13 seed to reach the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament, received 25 points and seven rebounds from Kameron McGusty. Nysier Brooks had 19 points with six rebounds, while Isaiah Wong had 12 points and four assists. After trailing 33-29 at halftime, Jordan Usher's dunk with 11:31 remaining gave Georgia Tech a 53-51 lead it wouldn't relinquish. The Yellow Jackets stretched their advantage to as many as eight points at 66-58 following Alvarado's two free throws with 3:21 remaining. The Hurricanes pulled to within 68-66 on McGusty's 3-pointer with 31.9 seconds remaining. But the Yellow Jackets secured their first victory in an ACC tournament game in coach Josh Pastner's five years when Usher dunked with 16.5 seconds remaining for the final four-point margin and Miami turned it over on its ensuing possession. The Hurricanes committed 12 of their 18 turnovers in the second half, when they made just 10 field goals, with five coming from beyond the 3-point arc. Georgia Tech made 17 field goals on 30 attempts in the second half and (56.7 percent) after making just 11 on 28 attempts in the first half (39.3 percent). Georgia Tech's Moses Wright, the ACC's Player of the Year, scored seven points on 3-of-9 shooting and added six rebounds before fouling out with 2:30 remaining. Miami grabbed the halftime lead largely on play of Brooks and McGusty, who combined for 24 points. Brooks scored 16 on 5-of-7 shooting, going 6-of-8 from the free-throw line, while McGusty scored eight points on 4-of-7 shooting. --Field Level Media",

The England captain was in the right place to convert a rebound in the 25th minute and he gave his side some insurance to take to Croatia next week with a second after the break. It was an efficient display from Jose Mourinho's side as they claimed a fifth successive win in all competitions. A hard-working Dinamo, who had won their last six matches in the competition, could have made a dream start when Mislav Orsic ran through on goal in the opening minute but shot tamely. After that Tottenham were generally in command with Kane's 25th and 26th goals of the season enough to make them firm favourites to reach the last eight. The only worry for Tottenham, who face Arsenal in the north London derby on Sunday, was the sight of Kane having an ice pack applied to his knee after he was substituted late on.

        "full article": "PIRAEUS, Greece, March 11 (Reuters) - Martin Odegaard scored his first goal for Arsenal and Gabriel and Mohamed Elneny were also on target to give the English side a 3-1 win at Olympiakos in the first leg of their Europa League round of 16 tie on Thursday. Odegaard, who joined Arsenal on loan from Real Madrid in January, fired the visitors ahead with a 34th-minute strike from 25 metres before Youssef El Arabi equalised for the Greek team in the 58th minute. Arsenal looked rattled after conceding a soft goal but Brazilian defender Gabriel restored their lead with a looping header and substitute Elneny sealed the win with a long-range shot. Arsenal dominated the opening half and missed several chances, with Odegaard dragging a shot wide from a good position before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit the crossbar with a deflected header. Norway midfielder Odegaard struck out of the blue when he picked up the ball on the right flank and unleashed a thunderbolt through the hands of goalkeeper Jose Sa who should have done better. El Arabi took advantage of sloppy defending as Hector Bellerin gave the ball away and with goalkeeper Bernd Leno stranded, the Moroccan striker scored with a clinical finish. Bellerin made amends with a last-gasp intervention which denied El Arabi a second goal and it turned out to be a pivotal moment as Arsenal finished strongly. Gabriel put the visitors back in front when he rose superbly to meet Willian's cross from the right in the 79th minute before Elneny put the icing on the cake with a swerving drive five minutes from time.

Honest: Iman explained, 'To get a passport to leave the country I needed a signature from both my parents, but I faked it and said I was already 18. 'I didn\u2019t think I had a chance'Reflecting on her prolific career, Iman went on: 'The reason for my success was out of necessity, being a refugee in Kenya. When the opportunity [to be a model] arose, I thought I would give it a whirl.\u00a0'It was an opportunity to take care of my brothers and sisters because all of us were at the age of furthering our education when we became refugees. Through modelling I was able to finance my siblings\u2019 schooling.'But Iman claimed she's seen as 'average-looking' in Somalia, as she told editor-in-chief Lydia Slater: 'They still say [in Somalia] if Iman became a model every Somalian girl has a chance. I was an average girl, but I did good, I can\u2019t complain.'\u00a0Going on to discuss the institutional racism she experienced as a young model, she said she made sure she received the same pay as her white counterparts by going on 'a hiatus' until the discrepancy was solved.\u00a0         Plan: Iman (pictured with Cindy Crawford in 1989) said 'I thought I would go to the US and then go back in a couple of months before my parents would know I left'Iman explained: 'I walked into this industry, not knowing the discrepancy between what they were paying Black models versus Caucasian models.\u00a0To me it wasn\u2019t about Black or white, it was about what my worth was.\u00a0'If I was doing the same job as a Caucasian model, then I should be compensated for it.

It was the industry that had to change.\u00a0'If I can make them change for me, then that would become the norm for any other Black model that comes after me.'         Supermodel:\u00a0Of course Iman did succeed, becoming a muse for fashion designers like Gianni Versace, Halston, Calin Klein, and Yves Saint Laurent (pictured in 1979)The model added that she decided to launch her own range of make-up, IMAN Cosmetics, because a make-up artist once asked if she had her own foundation and made her look 'grey' because he didn't have make-up that suited her skin tone.'The seed was planted in my head on my first job in New York,' she began. 'I was working for American Vogue and at the shoot there was a makeup artist and a Caucasian model.\u00a0'When it came to my turn to get my makeup done, the makeup artist asked me, \u201cDid you bring your own foundation?\u201d\u00a0I was perplexed by the question because he didn\u2019t ask the Caucasian model.\u00a0'I said \u201cno.\u201d He then proceeded to mix and match products for my face and when I looked in the mirror, I didn\u2019t look brown anymore, I looked grey.'

Of course, I also chose someone who is like my father, kind and supportive.'         Love: Iman, who was married to David Bowie from 1992 until his death in 2016, said the iconic musician 'was always my biggest fan' and was 'kind and supportive' (pictured in 1996)Iman and David share 20-year-old daughter\u00a0Alexandria Zahra Jones, known as Lexi, together, who is a budding artist based in California.David also had a son, Duncan Jones, from a previous marriage while Iman shares her daughter Zulekha Haywood with a former love.It has been five years since\u00a0David shockingly passed away at the age of 69, on January 10, 2016, after an 18-month battle with cancer.Iman married the English rocker in a romantic ceremony in Lausanne, Switzerland in April 1992 which was later formalised in a wedding hosted in Florence in June.\u00a0\u00a0              Outing: Iman was seen enjoying a stroll through Soho in New York City on Thursday",

A theme of the Championship has been Farrell\u2019s place in the team coming under scrutiny for the first time and despite an improved performance against Wales, he is still facing calls to be dropped. The Saracens playmaker\u2019s leadership is also in question due to his spiky communication with referee Pascal Gauzere at the Principality Stadium, where England lacked direction during the closing stages. Le Crunch doesn't disappoint. #GuinnessSixNations \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f #ENGVFRA pic.twitter.com/bPK0LagnDH\u2014 Guinness Six Nations (@SixNationsRugby) March 9, 2021   And as a final indignity, he was criticised for his manner during a post-match TV interview. But Farrell enters Saturday\u2019s clash with France at Twickenham intent on looking ahead only. \u201cI don\u2019t think I dwell on it. You soon come to realise what\u2019s important and how you learn from things, take them going forward and put everything into the next thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hold on to things for too long you take your eye off what\u2019s actually going on now and what you can do to be in this week and be in the preparation for this game. \u201cA lot of people have their say and that\u2019s fair enough. Whether it matters to us or not is another thing. \u201cThe thing that does matter to us is the things that go on in here, the conversations that go on, the way we see and feel it. We obviously have the biggest insight. \u201cI understand people have opinions. That\u2019s fine. We are obviously going through a process of how to get the best out of ourselves and that\u2019s more what we are focused on.\u201d Farrell\u2019s Saracens team-mate Elliot Daly has been unable to retain his place following an afternoon of costly errors in Cardiff and the Lion is ousted at full-back by Max Malins. Another Saracen, Malins has spent the season on loan at Bristol where he has been showcasing his electric running skills full of breaks, assists and tries. The 24-year-old makes his first start after six brief cameo appearances dating back to last autumn and Farrell expects him to shine. \u201cMax has been on an upwards curve in terms of his performances and is playing more regularly now,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to Bristol in a year that\u2019s been brilliant for him and gone through the roof in terms of having regular game time and showing how good he is consistently. \ud83d\udcac \u201cThe squad have competed really hard in training since Sunday.

Max is a dangerous full-back. He makes things happen. He beats people. \u201cHe\u2019s quick and he\u2019s strong and he\u2019s got a great instinct about the game, which is a brilliant quality to have. \u201cHe\u2019s grown up as a fly-half predominantly, then a fly-half who can play a bit of full-back and now probably leaning a bit more towards full-back. \u201cHe\u2019s always been able to beat people, he\u2019s always been able to open the game up. That\u2019s been constant. He\u2019s probably now just doing it more and more with the more chances that he\u2019s got.\u201d",

LJ Figueroa scored a season-high 21 points to lead the Pac-12 regular season champions to their 20th win of the season. Figueroa's 3-pointer out of the corner gave the Ducks an 82-60 lead with 3:53 to play, and he tallied in double figures for the eighth straight game. Will Richardson added 17 points and nine assists, and Eugene Omoruyi scored 15 points. Oregon's bench chipped in 28 points as the Ducks (20-5) won their sixth straight game and 11th of their last 12. Alonzo Verge Jr.'s 28 points led the Sun Devils. Senior Remy Martin, a first-team All-Pac-12 selection, finished with 16 points in what was possibly his final game after four years in the program. The Ducks moved to 5-0 against Arizona State (11-14) in conference tournament games, and their semifinal game awaits on Friday against Oregon State or UCLA. After a close first half, the Ducks put distance between themselves and the Sun Devils early in the second half, taking a 14-point lead on Chandler Lawson's short jumper to make the score 54-40 with 11:38 to go. Lawson had a season-high 10 points off the bench as Oregon took an 18-point lead. The Sun Devils lost forward Kimani Lawrence with 13 minutes to play when Lawrence hustled down the court to try to block a breakaway layup from Richardson and injured his hamstring. Lawrence had to be helped off the court and finished with five points and six rebounds. The Ducks couldn't completely put away the Sun Devils until the final eight minutes, but maintained a comfortable lead throughout the second half with good shooting.

        "title": "Australian timber faces protracted logjam amid China's import freeze",
        "full article": "By Colin Packham and Jonathan Barrett CANBERRA/SYDNEY, March 12 (Reuters) - Australia is bracing for a drawn-out disruption to its A$1.6 billion ($1.23 billion) annual timber trade with China after requests to Beijing's customs officials to resume the log exports were ignored, two sources told Reuters. The four-million-tonne log timber trade with China has been largely suspended since late last year after Beijing said it had found pests in shipments coming from several Australian ports. Woodchips, however, continue to be exported to China. Australian timber is one of several commodities and products, including coal, barley, seafood and wine, subject to either trade bans or other restrictions by Beijing amid souring relations between the trade partners. While Beijing's curbs have roiled niche industries reliant on Chinese buyers, with shipments of rock lobsters and bottles of wine halted at customs, it has not targeted the more valuable iron ore and gas trade, which underpins a resurgent Australian economy. Australia's Department of Agriculture did not receive a response after providing evidence to China's General Administration of Customs that the shipments were sprayed with pesticides, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the approaches but declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. The cold shoulder from China suggests a potentially protracted period of strain for two-way trade, given the frosty relations between Canberra and Beijing is now ensnaring bureaucrats who would usually stay engaged during a temporary disagreement, they said. \"At least hundreds of workers nationally have already lost work as a result of forest thinning, harvesting and haulage, and port operations being deferred,\" Victor Violante, deputy chief executive of the Australian Forest Products Association (AFPA), told Reuters. \"If the trade suspension continues for months or even years, it will severely impact the whole supply chain including sawmills, and with it thousands more jobs.\" Diplomatic ties between Australia and its largest trading partner deteriorated last year after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus, angering China. In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, the Chinese foreign ministry said China applies normal precautionary biosecurity measures, such as inspection and quarantine, to overseas goods, and referred questions specific to the Australian timber case to the relevant authorities. PILING UP China typically takes more than 90% of Australian log exports, mainly consisting of cheaper \"pulp\" logs that most local mills aren't set up to process. Australian mills generally process more valuable sawlogs, used in the local construction industry. While the Australian economy is emerging strongly from the coronavirus pandemic, driven by robust mining, agriculture and housing industries, there are pockets of distress. While some logs can be turned into woodchips and exported - a category of timber not subject to Chinese restrictions - most pulp logs are either piling up or being left in the ground. \"It's virtually a ghost town in the log yards,\" said Steve Garner, who chairs the business-focussed Committee for Portland, a town in Victoria state heavily reliant on its deep-water port which exports logs to China. \"There have been hundreds of jobs that have been put on hold.\" Australia exports logs to China worth just over A$600 million and woodchips worth almost A$980 million annually, according to 2018-19 trade figures. Portland timber businesses told Reuters that India was the obvious market to replace China, although redirecting such large quantities would be a long-term process. The forestry and logging industry directly employs around 3,400 workers, government data shows, while support services such as timber trucking businesses employ an additional 4,900. David Quill, from the South Australian Timber Processors Association, said the issue was forcing Australia to seriously consider building up its own processing capacity. \"The positive effect, if there's been any, is that there is now more material available for manufacturing industries in Australia,\" said Quill.

        "full article": "MaCio Teague racked up 24 points as No. 2 Baylor outlasted a Herculean-effort by ninth-seeded Kansas State to post a 74-68 win on Thursday afternoon in a quarterfinal game of the Big 12 Conference tournament in Kansas City, Mo. The top-seeded Bears (22-1) will play fifth-seeded Oklahoma State, a winner over fourth-seeded West Virginia earlier Thursday, in one of the tournament's semifinals on Friday. Baylor led by just two points at the half and trailed on three occasions in the opening three minutes of the second half before taking charge with a 10-2 run, capped by a 3-pointer by Davion Mitchell. The bucket gave the Bears a 52-44 lead at the 13:19 mark. From there, the Bears stretched their advantage to as many as 12 points before Kansas State made a late run to claw within 72-68 in the final seconds. Baylor's three starting guards -- Teague, Mitchell (23 points), and Jared Butler (18) -- combined for 65 of the Bears' points in the win. Mark Vital added a game-high 10 rebounds in the victory, which Baylor secured despite a season-high 21 turnovers. Davion Bradford and Nijel Pack led the Wildcats with 18 points each with DaJuan Gordon adding 15 for Kansas State, which finished its season at 9-20. Baylor dominated the Wildcats in the teams' pair of regular-season matchups, winning by 31 points in Manhattan and then by 48 in Waco in the rematch. But Kansas State was more than up to the task on Thursday, coming into the game with wins in four of its past five contests and after dominating TCU in a 71-50 first-round victory on Wednesday. The Bears led only 36-34 at halftime despite outshooting Kansas State 54.5 percent to 46.2 percent, outrebounding the Wildcats 15-11 and hitting 5 of 12 shots from beyond the arc. Butler paced Baylor with 11 points while Mitchell hit for 10 over the first 20 minutes of play. Kansas State stayed close by forcing 13 Baylor turnovers and with Bradford pouring in 15 first-half points. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By Julie Ingwersen CHICAGO, March 11 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures fell to a one-month low on Thursday, pressured by forecasts for welcome moisture in the Southern Plains crop belt that should boost wheat production prospects, traders said. But soybean and corn futures ended higher, supported by South American supply worries and soaring global vegetable oil prices. Chicago Board of Trade May wheat futures settled down 10 cents at $6.42-1/2 per bushel after dipping to $6.39, the contract's lowest level since Feb. 12. CBOT May soybeans ended up 3-3/4 cents at $14.13-1/2 a bushel and May corn rose 4-1/2 cents to finish at $5.38-1/2 per bushel. Weekend storms were taking aim at the Plains wheat belt, much of which has endured dry conditions for several months. The region's winter wheat is just starting its key spring growth phase, when the crop's need for water increases. \"A much wetter (and snowier) weather pattern is expected across the central Plains through early next week, which will significantly ease dryness in Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma,\" space technology company Maxar said in a daily client note. Meanwhile, Egypt's state grains buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), bought 360,000 tonnes of Romanian wheat in an international purchasing tender, its first since early February. Soybean futures rose as CBOT soyoil futures set across-the-board contract highs and rival Malaysian palm oil futures notched a 13-year top. \"Soybean oil futures traded to new contract highs on the upside explosion in world vegetable oil prices,\" DC Analysis President Dan Cekander said in a client note. Uncertainty about South American crop prospects lent support. The Buenos Aires Grains Exchange lowered its estimates of Argentina's soybean harvest to 44 million tonnes and its corn forecast to 45 million tonnes, below its previous forecasts of 46 million tonnes for each crop, citing dry conditions. However, in neighboring Brazil, government supply agency Conab raised its estimates of Brazil's 2020/21 soybean and corn harvests.

        "full article": "Notorious serial killer Ivan Milat could have claimed the lives of 20 more victims, including a 20-year-old pregnant woman whose body was dumped in a field, experts have claimed.Milat murdered seven young backpackers and dumped their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, between 1989 and 1992.He was 74 years old when he died in October 2019 at Long Bay jail's hospital from oesophageal and stomach cancer.The backpacker murderer will now be the focus of a\u00a0true crime series airing this weekend on Channel 7, which will reportedly expose new evidence that Milat was responsible for other killings.         Milat murdered seven young backpackers and dumped their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, between 1989 and 1992         Crime experts believe Keren Rowland (pictured), 20, was actually Milat's first victim.\u00a0Ms Rowland was reported missing after she failed to turn up to a party in Deakin, Canberra on February 26, 1971Criminologist Dr Xanthe Mallett and criminal psychologist Tim Watson-Munro appeared on Sunrise on Friday morning ahead of the show's release, where they made bold claims about the secrets Milat took to the grave.\u00a0'Milat's a psychopath, a\u00a0marauding serial killer, no remorse. He clearly enjoyed what he did,' Mr Watson-Munro told hosts David Koch and Natalie Barr.'I've worked with a lot of people over 40 years. Nothing had prepared me for the evil and horror of this particular offender.'The pair believe\u00a0Keren Rowland, 20, was actually Milat's first victim.

It really spoke to us, to have all of the same hallmarks as the Ivan Milat victims that we know are attributed to him.'\u00a0Mr Watson-Munro said they are sure about six deaths being linked to Milat.\u00a0'We're very firm on others. But in a generic sense, there's lots of victims out there,' he said.'There are other serial killers operating in Australia right now.'Milat was born two days after Christmas 1944, one of 14 children of Australian-born Margaret and Yugoslavian-born Steven Milat who lived in Sydney's west.He left school at 15, had minor dealings with the police and worked on the roads for years, around Sydney and country NSW.The self-confessed gun enthusiast was regarded as a conscientious employee, with one boss saying he was 'the best worker we ever had'.His former wife Karen, who left him in 1987 after four years of marriage, described him as 'gun crazy', recalling him killing kangaroos on a visit to Belanglo State Forest.              Caroline Clarke (left) and\u00a0Simone Schmidl (right) were two victims of the backpacker murderer\u00a0         Milat murdered seven young people including\u00a0German couple Anja Habschied, 20, and Gabor Neugebauer, 21       'Ivan pulled out a rifle, shot the first kangaroo, shot the second kangaroo, slit its throat and kicked it to make sure it was dead,' she said.The outing could be seen as a gruesome preview of his frenzied attacks on the seven hitchhikers - Melbourne couple Deborah Everist, 19, and James Gibson, 19; German traveller Simone Schmidl, 21; German couple Anja Habschied, 20, and Gabor Neugebauer, 21; and British friends Joanne Walters, 22, and Caroline Clarke, 21.Their bodies were found covered with branches and leaf litter in the forest between between September 1992 and November 1993.One victim was decapitated, another shot 10 times in the head. Many were stabbed so savagely their bones were chipped, some had been gagged or bound, and some were suspected of having been sexually assaulted.Milat also was found guilty of kidnapping British backpacker Paul Onions who escaped his clutches in January 1990, near the turn-off to the forest.\u00a0The crimes made headlines around the world, shattering Australia's standing as a safe haven for budget-conscious young travellers.Over the years, Milat has been linked to the disappearance of other young men and women.Ivan Milat: Buried Secrets airs on Channel 7 this Sunday at 7pm\u00a0         Milat (pictured) was born two days after Christmas 1944, one of 14 children of Australian-born Margaret and Yugoslavian-born Steven Milat who lived in Sydney's west THE LIFE AND TIMES OF IVAN MILAT  EARLY LIFE* Ivan Robert Marko Milat born in Sydney on December 27, 1944, the fifth of 14 children.* He served time in a juvenile correction centre and prison for relatively minor charges.* In 1974, he was cleared of raping one of two young hitchhikers he picked up three years earlier near the same highway where the seven murdered backpackers were picked up.MILAT'S VICTIMS AND THEIR REMAINS* Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19, are last seen in inner-Sydney in December 1989 after planning to hitchhike. Their skeletal remains are found in Belanglo State Forest in October 1993.* German backpacker Simone Schmidl, 20, vanishes while hitchhiking from Sydney to Melbourne in January 1991. Her remains are found in the forest in November 1993.* German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and Anja Habschied, 20, disappear from Kings Cross having planned to hitchhike from Sydney to Darwin in December 1991. Their remains are found in November 1993.* British backpackers Caroline Clarke, 21, and Joanne Walters, 22, leave a Kings Cross hostel in April 1992. Their bodies are found in the forest in September 1992.THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY* British backpacker Paul Thomas Onions flees from a driver with a gun near the turn-off to the forest on January 25, 1990. He gives a description of his assailant to police on the day of the attack but only identifies Milat as that man from 13 photographs shown to him by police four years later.THE TRIAL* Police raid a home in Eagle Vale, on the outskirts of Sydney, on May 22, 1994 and arrest Milat.* He is charged with seven counts of murder and one count of kidnapping Mr Onions.* He is found guilty of all charges in July 1996 and jailed for life.* Both the crown and defence agree the murderer is a Milat.* Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi, QC, says the evidence points to Ivan Milat being the killer although it is likely he didn't act alone.* Defence barrister Terry Martin argues it is a reasonable possibility it was his brother Richard, perhaps aided by another sibling Walter or a friend.WHO SAID WHAT* Mr Tedeschi tells the jury up to 40 features relating to Milat matched the description Mr Onions gave of his attacker.'It is my submission there is only one person in the whole of Australia who matches all of those descriptions - the man, the car, the equipment and the place - and that is the accused,' he said.Submitting that the killer was not Ivan Milat acting alone or in company, Mr Martin suggests one or two of his brothers could have planted items, including gun parts linked to some murders, at his house.'Do you think a person capable of these most brutal of crimes would give two hoots about planting gear on a brother?' he asked.* In a quivering voice, the trial judge Justice David Hunt jails Milat for life on the day of the verdicts.'These seven young persons were at the threshold of their lives, with everything to look forward to - travel, career, happiness, love, family, and even old age,' he said.SOURCE: AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS\u00a0\u00a0Advertisement",

        "full article": "The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) reports at more than 2,000 songbirds have died in the state from December 20 through March 8 \u2013 and the culprit is sitting in people\u2019s backyards.The agency determined the birds are contracting Salmonellosis, a disease cause by Salmonella bacteria, by sharing bird feeders with other infected avian species.Pine siskins, a species of finch that winters in California, are the primary species affected by the outbreak, along with a small number of goldfinches.\u2018When there is a disease circulating in the population, bird feeders ensure the birds remain in really close contact with one another, as well as other birds, as they use the feeder (think of having to share one dinner plate or one water glass with your whole family as well as with everyone in your neighborhood without washing it between each individual),\u2019 Krysta Rogers, Senior Environmental Scientist with CDFW told DailyMail.com in an email.\u2018Bird feeders also keep the birds in one location for longer periods of time allowing feces to build up.\u2019\u2018If there are sick birds in that group, they will shed the Salmonella bacteria in their feces, contaminating the area leading to more and more birds becoming sick and dying from the infection as they try to access the feeder or feed on the spilled seeds under the feeder.\u2019\u2018The most effective way to slow the spread of this infection and reduce mortality is to remove the bird feeders because that is primarily where this disease spreads.\u2019         The are contracting Salmonellosis, a disease cause by Salmonella bacteria, by sharing bird feeders with other infected avian species. Pine siskins (pictured) are the primary species affected by the outbreakSalmonellosis is an infection with a Salmonella bacteria that lives in the intestinal tracts of animals, including birds.And it can be transmitted to humans who eat food contaminated with animal feces.\u00a0   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       World's oldest-known wild bird hatches another new chick:...    Forget foreplay! Male superb lyrebirds imitate the sound of...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n The disease is found to spread to birds during the winter months and has occurred in California previous years.The last event was between December 2019 and April 2020, but only 110 dead birds were reported, but Rogers says \u2018only about a quarter were suspected of having Salmonellosis.\u2019         The highest number of reports are from Sonoma (228), Santa Clara (231), Marin (173), Contra Costa (150), San Mateo (143), Santa Cruz (115), Alameda (109), Sacramento (109) and Placer (72) counties. Goldfinches (pictured) are also being impacted\u2018Our lab confirmed Salmonellosis in several birds including pine siskins and goldfinches submitted for testing, so it appears the infection was circulating at a relatively low level within the population last winter,\u2019 she continued.However, this outbreak appears to be more rampant and specifically along California\u2019s coast.The highest number of reports are from Sonoma (228), Santa Clara (231), Marin (173), Contra Costa (150), San Mateo (143), Santa Cruz (115), Alameda (109), Sacramento (109) and Placer (72) counties.\u2018Salmonellosis occurs periodically in pine siskins in some winters throughout their range. When large numbers of pine siskins congregate, the disease can spread rapidly causing high mortality,\u2019 Rogers shared in a statement.Most birds die within 24 hours of infection.\u2019Birds that are sick will often have ruffled feathers and move slowly. Some also experience labored breathing or their eyes may appear swollen and partially closed.If you find a bird that looks ill, the CDFW urges you to wear disposable gloves and wash hands if you plan on disposing of the carcass, along with handling birdfeeders.'It is unclear if Salmonella bacteria completely disappear from the population. It may be that some birds recover, but still carry low levels of bacteria in their intestinal tract, and under certain conditions become more susceptible to developing the disease,' said Roger.'Most Salmonellosis outbreaks end when the pine siskins return to their breeding grounds, typically late March or April.'\u00a0'On their breeding grounds, pine siskins are more dispersed for breeding activities like nest building and raising chicks, so infection tends to be less common.'Salmonella: A bacteria that can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps and feverSalmonella\u00a0are a group of bacteria that\u00a0infect the gut.\u00a0They live in animal and human intestines and are shed through feces.Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food.\u00a0Contamination is possible if raw and cooked foods are stored together.Symptoms of salmonella infections include diarrhea, stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever.On average, it takes from 12 to 72 hours for the symptoms to develop after swallowing an infectious dose of salmonella.They usually last for four to seven days and most people recover without treatment.But if you become seriously ill, you may need hospital care because the dehydration caused by the illness can be life-threatening.\u00a0\u00a0Source: NHS ChoicesAdvertisement",

        "full article": "Tre Mann finished with 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists to help Florida shake off upset-minded Vanderbilt and advance to the quarterfinals of the SEC tournament with a 69-63 victory on Thursday afternoon in Nashville. The Gators (14-8) -- the tournament's No. 5 seed -- swept their three meetings this season with the 12th-seeded Commodores (9-16), who were led by Scotty Pippen Jr.'s 23 points, including 10-for-10 shooting from the free throw line. It was also the Gators' first win when scoring under 70 points this season. Florida plays No. 4 seed Tennessee (17-7) in the quarterfinals on Friday afternoon. The teams split during the regular season with the Volunteers winning the most recent matchup last Sunday, 65-54, in Knoxville. Mann shot 7-for-12 from the field and came up with the key plays down the stretch to secure the victory for the Gators, who snapped a two-game skid. Mann's jumper with 53 seconds left gave Florida a 66-63 lead. Vanderbilt's Trey Thomas, who finished with 12 points, had an open look at the other end for a tie, but missed a 3-pointer with 31 seconds to go. Mann was fouled and hit one of two free throws to help put the game away. The Gators used a 12-2 run over the final 5:30 of the first half, capped by a pair of triples by Noah Locke, to open up a 34-22 lead at the break. Locke scored 11 of his 13 points in the first half. But the typically sharp-shooting Commodores, who entered the game averaging 9.3 made 3-pointers per game, hit a pair of threes quickly to open the second half. Vanderbilt took a 55-54 lead with 8:39 left in the second half on an 11-0 run powered by three triples by Thomas. Vanderbilt matched their season average of 3-pointers madel, but shot only 29 percent from beyond the arc (9-of-31). Pippen Jr., who averaged 25 points during the first two games against the Gators, shot 6-of-19 from the field and made only 1-of-7 three-point attempts. Tyree Appleby chipped in 12 points and four assists off the Gators bench. D.J. Harvey totaled 12 points and five rebounds for the Commodores. --Field Level Media",

        "title": "No. 2 Baylor holds off K-State 74-68 in Big 12 quarters",
        "full article": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Baylor coach Scott Drew has always believed the team that advanced the previous night in the Big 12 Tournament has the advantage in the first half over the team that had a bye into the quarterfinal round. The team with the fresh legs has the advantage down the stretch. That played out in the second-ranked Bears' survive-and-advance win over Kansas State on Thursday. It took big games from the backcourt of MaCio Teague, Davion Mitchell and Jared Butler along with some crucial plays in the closing seconds for the Bears to hold on for a 74-68 victory and avoid what would have been one of the biggest upsets in tournament history. \"I thought we were a little tentative,\" Drew said. \"In the first game you have a little jitters. A lot of our guys hadn't played in the Big 12 Tournament. They were really excited and sometimes that makes you play hesitant. But give Kansas State a lot of credit. I thought they had a great game plan.\" The top-seeded Bears (22-1) rolled into T-Mobile Arena after their first regular-season conference title since 1950, three straight wins over ranked teams and with a No. 1 seed in next week\u00b4s NCAA Tournament nearly locked up. Yet the Wildcats (9-20), who lost their two regular-season games to Baylor by an average of 40 points, never allowed the high-powered Bears to slip away. The plucky bunch of kids kept answering baskets until the final minute. Freshman Nijel Pack\u00b4s sixth 3-pointer got them within 70-66 with just over a minute to go.          Baylor's Matthew Mayer, left, blocks a shot by Kansas State's DaJuan Gordon (3) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in the second round of the Big 12 Conference tournament in Kansas City, Mo., Thursday, March 11, 2021. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  Mitchell missed at the other end, but Kansas State couldn\u00b4t capitalize when Mike McGuirl threw a wild pass that Pack batted into the air. The Bears came down with the loose ball and Butler made a couple free throws to seal the win. It sent Baylor into a semifinal matchup with No. 12 Oklahoma State on Friday night. Teague finished with 24 points, Mitchell had 23 and Butler had 18 as the Bears' starting backcourt scored all but nine of their points. But while Teague was solid with the ball, Butler and Mitchell had 13 of Baylor's 21 turnovers. \"We knew it wasn't going to be easy. It's hard to beat a team three times,\" Mitchell said. \"They had a really good plan. They played really hard, really tough. They won yesterday so they had a lot of momentum, so it's good for us in the long run.\" Pack finished with 18 points, as did Davion Bradford, as the ninth-seeded Wildcats lost their ninth straight game against the top seed in the Big 12 Tournament. Kansas State had beaten No. 10 seed TCU in the opening round. \"It felt good for us to have courage and show the improvement we had from the beginning of the year to now, so it felt good,\" Pack said. \"It feels like we're a whole new team. It's like a preview of the years to come.\" Baylor struggled after a late-season, three-week pause because of COVID-19, barely squeaking past Big 12 bottom-dweller Iowa State and losing its only game at Kansas. But the Bears appeared to get their legs - and lungs - back with an overtime win at West Virginia followed by easy wins over ranked teams Oklahoma State and Texas Tech. They must have lost their mojo again on the way to Kansas City. The Bears struggled to control the 7-foot Bradford in the paint. They couldn't track down Pack on the perimeter. They coughed up a dozen turnovers by halftime, and they were slow getting to just about every loose ball. Kansas State hung around long enough to take a 37-36 lead, its first of the game, on Pack's 3-pointer out of the break. The Bears slowly regained control, and when Mitchell answered Pack's fifth 3 with one of his own - and Teague converted a three-point play moments later - they finally had some breathing room for the first time. They needed every bit of it down the stretch. BIG PICTURE Kansas State had the second-most starts by freshmen in the country behind Kentucky, and it showed during a 13-game losing streak amid a 5-18 start. But the Wildcats may have been the most improved team in the league down the stretch, winning four of five capped by their win over TCU in the first round of the tournament. Baylor struggled to handle Kansas big man David McCormack in its lone loss this season, and its inability to deal with post players showed up again Thursday. Bradford is far from polished in the paint, but he managed to get a series of easy points at the the rim, and that should concern Drew ahead of the NCAA Tournament. UP NEXT The Bears will play the red-hot Cowboys on Friday night for a spot in the championship game. ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25          Baylor's Matthew Mayer (24) is pressured by Kansas State's Rudi Williams during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in the second round of the Big 12 Conference tournament in Kansas City, Mo., Thursday, March 11, 2021.

        "title": "Wyoming election changes move ahead after push by Trump Jr.",
        "full article": "CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) - Wyoming lawmakers will continue to discuss proposed election changes endorsed by Donald Trump Jr. for their potential to undermine U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, but not for next year as originally planned. A legislative committee voted Thursday to delay the proposal for what would be Wyoming's first primary runoffs from as soon as 2022 to no sooner than 2024. Local election officials told lawmakers they wouldn't have enough time to make both the election changes and required adjustments to legislative district boundaries next year. \"It\u00b4s too big of a lift in a redistricting year,\" Mary Lankford with the Wyoming County Clerks Association told the state Senate elections committee. Local officials also said they worried about cost. The committee wrote the potential $1.5 million cost into the bill before voting 4-1 to advance it to the full Senate. In the Senate, the cost could be a turnoff to lawmakers confronted with declining revenue from Wyoming's coal, oil and gas industries, which have led to steep state and local cuts. Two state legislators -- Sen. Anthony Bouchard, of Cheyenne, and Rep. Chuck Gray, of Casper - already have announced they are running against Cheney, Wyoming's lone congresswoman and a fellow Republican, for voting to impeach President Donald Trump for the U.S. Capitol riot. Trump Jr. in January urged Wyoming voters to unite behind a Cheney opponent next year when he called in at an anti-Cheney rally led by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz at the Wyoming Capitol. \"Any Republican in Wyoming who does Liz Cheney\u00b4s bidding and opposes SF145 is turning their back on my father and the entire America First movement,\" Trump Jr. tweeted Tuesday in support of the election changes. Cheney hasn't publicly taken a position on the bill. She \"trusts the state Legislature to do what is right for Wyoming,\" spokesman Jeremy Adler said by email Thursday. Cheney wasn't mentioned in Thursday's discussion of the bill, which supporters - Trump Jr. excepted - haven't described as a political weapon against her. The state GOP central committee censured Cheney in February for her impeachment vote. But for the most part Wyoming's Republican elected officials have continued to support her. In her first run for U.S. House in 2016, Cheney won a nine-way Republican primary with just short of 40% while the runner-up got 22%. Under the bill, a runoff would occur if no candidate got more than 50%. That's already a higher possibility in 2022 than the 2020 and 2018 primaries, when Cheney beat far lesser-known Republican opponents with commanding majorities. A runoff could consolidate Cheney's opponents to a single candidate. In GOP-dominated Wyoming, the winner would then be heavily favored in the general election. Between the primary and any runoff, candidates could have \"real debates instead of a beauty pageant where you have a dozen candidates come up and speak for 15 seconds,\" testified Cheyenne attorney Darin Smith, a Republican who lost to Cheney with 15% in 2016 and has said that he too may run against her again. Legislators agreed with the concerns about implementation and cost, however. \"I don\u00b4t think the bill as it stands right now is workable from all the testimony we\u00b4ve heard,\" Sen. Brian Boner, a Republican from Douglas and a sponsor of the bill, said in support of the changes. \"We have to have a bill that actually works.\" ___ Follow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver",

        "full article": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Tre Mann scored 22 points, and Florida held off Vanderbilt 69-63 Thursday to advance to the Southeastern Conference tournament quarterfinals. The fifth-seeded Gators (14-8) snapped a two-game skid coming into the tournament, and they will play No. 4 seed Tennessee on Friday for the second game between the teams in six days. Noah Locke scored 13 points for Florida, and Tyree Appleby added 12 off the bench. Vanderbilt (9-16) lost to Florida for the third time this season and sixth straight in this series. Scotty Pippen Jr. led the Commodores with 23 points, making all 10 free throws. D.J. Harvey and Trey Thomas each had 12 points. The Commodores, who won only three league games in the regular season, had their chances for a second SEC win within 24 hours.

But Mann hit a jumper with 53 seconds to go, and Thomas missed a 3 for Vandy with 31 seconds remaining as the Gators held on. Florida appeared ready to cruise to a sixth straight win in this series up 34-22 at halftime after the Gators scored the final eight of the half. Thomas keyed an 11-0 spurt with three consecutive 3s for Vanderbilt, the last giving the Commodores their first lead since the opening minutes at 55-54 with 8:39 remaining. Appleby put Florida ahead to stay with two free throws with 7:13 left at 58-57. BIG PICTURE Florida: The SEC\u00b4s best shooting team made this game closer than it needed to be. The Gators went cold from the floor in the second half, missing five straight and going more than five minutes without a field goal. They did hold Vanderbilt without a field goal the final 4:05. Vanderbilt: The Commodores missed Dylan Disu, the SEC's leading rebounder. He averaged 9.2 rebounds per game before having season-ending knee surgery on Feb. 26. They were outscored 34-18 in the paint and outrebounded 38-29. LATE GATORS Appleby and Scottie Lewis both were late to Florida's shootaround Thursday morning, according to the SEC Network, and both wound up on the bench to start the game. Appleby played seven minutes in the first half and Lewis just six.

Ali Elmezayen, 45, drove the family's Honda sedan -- with his ex-wife and two sons inside -- off a wharf in San Pedro, south of Los Angeles, on April 9, 2015. His sons, aged eight and 13, drowned but his ex-wife, Raba Diab, was saved by a fisherman who threw her a flotation device. Elmezayen escaped through an open driver's side window and swam to a ladder on the dock. Following the deaths of his sons, Elmezayen, an Egyptian national, collected more than $260,000 on insurance policies from two companies. Authorities said Elmezayen transferred most of the money to Egypt and about $80,000 was seized from his US account. Elmezayen was convicted in October 2019 of federal charges of mail and wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering. US District Judge John Walter sentenced him to 212 years in prison and denounced what he called the \"vicious and callous nature of his crimes.\" \"He is the ultimate phony and a skillful liar,\" Walter said. \"The only regret that the defendant has is that he got caught.\" Elmezayen still faces state charges for the murder of his two sons and attempted murder of his ex-wife.",

They have a date with Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, next month, and are now well set for the quarter-finals of this competition.The only concern, three days out from a North London derby at Arsenal, was the sight of Kane holding a large a bag of ice to his right knee after making way for Carlos Vinicius in the closing minutes of the game.'I don't believe it's anything big,' said Mourinho, moving swiftly to ease any fears.\u00a0'Sunday is a match everyone wants to play and little things will not stop him.

He helps us a lot. We couldn't be happier. I gave a rest to many of the players and am so happy with what Vinicius is giving us. But with Harry on the pitch it is a different story for us.'Dinamo Zagreb presented Spurs with their sternest test thus far in this European campaign. The Croatian champions were organised, industrious and aggressive, and might easily have taken the lead within a minute of the kick-off.Tanguy Ndombele played a careless pass straight to Dinamo's Mislav Orsic, effectively offering him a clear run through on goal, and Spurs were only spared by a feeble finish.Tottenham settled and went ahead midway through the first half. Kane started the move from deep inside his own half.\u00a0A long pass from Kane, intended for Heung-min Son, was headed down by and collected by Dele Alli before Ben Davies set Erik Lamela on a dribble towards goal.Lamela, so often influential on European nights, shimmied and jinked into the penalty area and beat goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic only to see his shot thump against the foot of a post and roll out and across goal.Kane had made up the ground and, courtesy of his predatory instincts, barely had to break his stride to sweep the rebound into the open net.The goal was his 25th for Spurs in all competitions this season, more than in either of the previous two seasons. His consistency is incredible and goal number 26 arrived in the second half when he pounced on a failed clearance.              Gareth Bale had to make do with a place on the bench but almost got on the scoresheet         The forward was substituted after briefly going down and had ice on his knee on the bench         Kane was back on his feet by full-time with the north London derby around the cornerNdombele sprayed a pass wide to Serge Aurier who crossed on the volley. Former Cardiff defender Kevin Theophile-Catherine cut it out but dropped the ball at the feet of the England captain who made no mistake.Ice in his veins. Ice on his knee. 'A master of football,' said Dinamo boss Zoran Mamic.Twice, Gareth Bale went close to a third and Mourinho moved to bolster his midfield, sending on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg for Ndombele. They preserved the clean sheet. There is no 'away goal' for the visitors. But Hojbjerg will be banned for the second leg after picking up a late yellow card.'One more goal would be a good reflection of the game and would put us in a much better position,' said Mourinho. 'It is open, it will not be easy.'   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'How has he missed that?': Harry Maguire spurns chance from...    EXCLUSIVE: Chelsea are keen on Kingsley Coman as a...

        "title": "Kaapo Kahkonen, Wild start three-game set vs. Coyotes",
        "full article": "Two hot goaltenders are likely to square off when the Arizona Coyotes visit the Minnesota Wild on Friday in Saint Paul, Minn. After Cam Talbot had to miss time due to COVID-19 protocols, Kaapo Kahkonen has broken out as the Wild's primary goalie. Kahkonen is 8-0-0 over his last eight starts, the longest winning streak by any goalie in the NHL this season. Overall, Kahkonen has a .922 save percentage and 2.19 goals against average over 15 games. It has been quite the performance for a goalie who entered the season with only five NHL games on his resume. However, Kahkonen's emergence was no surprise to Minnesota defenseman Carson Soucy, who played alongside Kahkonen for the Wild's AHL affiliate in Iowa. \"We saw it in Iowa all the time. ... Game in, game out, he's a gamer,\" Soucy said. \"He's going to compete, he's going to make those big saves and those timely saves. We saw it down there and it's definitely translating (to the NHL).\" Since Talbot has struggled to an 0-2-1 record and .865 save percentage in his last three starts, Kahkonen is likely to get another start on Friday. Kahkonen's unbeaten run includes a previous victory over the Coyotes, as the goalie stopped 24 of 25 shots in a 5-1 Minnesota win on March 5. The Coyotes bounced back for a 5-2 win over Talbot and the Wild the next night, then went 1-0-1 against the Colorado Avalanche in an unusual two-game road series. Arizona left Denver with three of a possible four points despite recording only 14 shots in each of the two games. Despite the overall positive results, Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet wasn't happy with what he felt was a lack of effort and preparation over the two Colorado games. \"We've got to get some guys to play better,\" Tocchet said. \"We've got to get some guys to compete a little bit harder. We can't have five or six guys not ready. ...That's on me, I guess. I've got to get those guys ready, maybe try something different.\" Arizona was outshot by a whopping 46-14 margin in Wednesday's 2-1 overtime loss to the Avalanche, but goalie Antti Raanta recorded 44 saves to keep the Coyotes within striking distance. The 44 saves tied the third-highest single-game save total of Raanta's eight-year NHL career. Since entering Monday's game in place of an injured Darcy Kuemper, Raanta has stopped 60 of 62 shots (.968 save percentage). Raanta and backup Adin Hill might be handling goaltending duty for an extended period of time, as Kuemper is expected to miss multiple weeks with a lower-body injury. Coyotes forward Clayton Keller has eight points (three goals, five assists) during a six-game points streak. Minnesota's 4-3 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights saw Joel Eriksson Ek score his team-leading ninth and 10th goals of the season. Kirill Kaprizov scored a power-play marker on Wednesday, snapping the Wild's 0-for-20 drought with the extra attacker over their last eight-plus games. Minnesota has the fewest power play goals (six) of any team in the NHL. Friday's matchup is the first of three games in five days between the Coyotes and Wild in Saint Paul. --Field Level Media",

Especially because I think the tourism problems in Queensland are completely self-inflicted,' she said in reference to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's state border closures.\u00a0'I am a bit disappointed.\u00a0It's fair to say that Sydney, in particular, has been smashed by Covid,' she told radio 2GB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         These are the 13 places that Australians can fly to and from on half-price tickets from April 1. But they must fly interstate              Gladys Berejiklian (right) has lashed Scott Morrison's half-price airline tickets policy, saying it favours Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (left)Over the past year Ms Berejiklian has been critical of Ms Palaszczuk's policy to shut her borders at the first sign of a Covid outbreak in another state.\u00a0Qantas boss Alan Joyce said he had to cancel 1,500 flights into Queensland in January when borders were closed due to a handful of cases on Sydney's Northern Beaches.\u00a0Premier Palaszczuk said she 'welcomes the new support' but demanded 'more direct support' for tourism once JobKeeper ends on March 28 and also called for Brisbane-Cairns flights to be included.\u00a0Federal Home Affairs Minister hit back, telling the Today show on Friday morning: 'There are lots of people that will take any dollar that you give them, and if you give them one dollar they ask for a second.'\u00a0Victoria's acting premier James Merlino blasted the plan for only including one Victorian destination - Avalon near Melbourne.'It's like they are looking at the Melbourne and Sydney markets and using them as the source for markets across the rest of the country. It is not fair, and we are disappointed,' he said.'You only have to look at the numbers. Five in Queensland, three in Tassie, two in the Northern Territory, just one in Victoria. This is not a great outcome for tourism operators, other than those who will be serviced by flights to Avalon.'\u00a0The scheme has also been slammed by regional airline Rex who say 70 per cent of the routes are dominated by Qantas and Jetstar.Rex deputy chairman John Sharp branded the scheme\u00a0QantasKeeper, telling\u00a0NCA NewsWire: 'It's really a Qantas package.\u00a0'They'll get 70 per cent of all the money and we'll get the scraps.'\u00a0       Under Mr Morrison's plan, interstate tickets to and from 13 holiday hotspots will be subsidised by the federal government until July 31 and airlines will ramp up their flight schedules to deal with an expected surge in demand over the next three months.The locations on offer are the Gold Coast, Cairns, the Whitsundays and Mackay region (including Proserpine and Hamilton Island), the Sunshine Coast, Lasseter and Alice Springs, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie, Broome, Avalon, Merimbula, and Kangaroo Island.\u00a0Some 57 routes will be covered on the Qantas and Jetstar network, CEO Alan Joyce said on Thursday morning.\u00a0\u00a0The discount means a return ticket from Sydney to Cairns which currently costs $233 could be as little as $116.50.A return between Melbourne and the Gold Coast, which is now on sale from $130, could cost just $65.\u00a0To get their half-price tickets, Australians simply need to head to the Qantas, Jetstar or Virgin websites after April 1 and they will see the dramatically reduced fares.\u00a0The discount only applies to inter-state travel, not intra-state flights - providing an incentive to premiers to keep their state borders open.There will be no limit on the number of tickets available but the government expects an average of 46,000 people per week - a total of about 800,000 - will fly on the subsidised flights.\u00a0The areas involved have been chosen because they rely on tourism for their wealth and are particularly dependent on aviation for their visitor numbers.         Almost a million airline tickets will be go on sale at half price on April 1 under a $1.2billion package to boost the ailing the tourism sector. Flights to the Gold Coast (pictured) could be as cheap as $49The scheme is part of a huge bail-out package for the tourism sector which employs 611,000 Australians and has been crippled by the Covid-induced international border shutdown.Amid a stark warning that 100,000 people could be fired when JobKeeper ends, the government will also give monthly payments to airlines to retain 8,600 international workers such as pilots and cabin crew until October 31 when the border is expected to re-open with every Australian vaccinated.Virgin CEO Jayne Hrdlicka and Qantas boss Mr Joyce welcomed the package.'This is great news for Australian aviation. This is great news for Australian tourism. This is great news for Qantas, but particularly for Qantas employees,' Mr Joyce said.\u00a0'I think it also is an incentive for the states to keep their borders open. And that's important, because we can't keep on going through the yoyo of the ups and downs of that,' he added.\u00a0Mr Joyce said he expects 22 of 25 Qantas international routes to restart in October alongside all 13 Jetstar routes -but he's prepared to start earlier or wait longer depending on the Covid-19 situation.\u00a0 Some of the discounted routes Aussies can fly on   \u00a0Far North Queensland\u00a0\u00a0Melbourne \u2013 CairnsSydney \u2013 CairnsDarwin \u2013 CairnsNew South Wales\u00a0\u00a0Melbourne - Merimbula\u00a0Gold Coast\u00a0\u00a0Adelaide \u2013 Gold CoastMelbourne \u2013 Gold CoastSydney \u2013 Gold CoastCanberra \u2013 Gold CoastAvalon \u2013 Gold Coast\u00a0Tasmania\u00a0\u00a0Melbourne \u2013 LauncestonSydney \u2013 LauncestonBrisbane \u2013 LauncestonMelbourne \u2013 DevonportMelbourne \u2013 Burnie\u00a0Western Australia\u00a0\u00a0Darwin \u2013 BroomeSydney \u2013 BroomeMelbourne \u2013 Broome\u00a0   \u00a0Whitsundays and Mackay\u00a0\u00a0Sydney \u2013 ProserpineSydney \u2013 Hamilton Island\u00a0Sunshine Coast (Queensland)\u00a0Sydney \u2013 MaroochydoreMelbourne \u2013 MaroochydoreAdelaide \u2013 MaroochydoreAlice Springs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adelaide \u2013 Alice SpringsSydney \u2013 UluruBrisbane \u2013 Alice SpringsMelbourne \u2013 Alice SpringsPerth \u2013 Alice SpringsSydney \u2013 Alice SpringsBrisbane \u2013 UluruMelbourne \u2013 Uluru\u00a0Melbourne (Avalon Airport)\u00a0\u00a0Gold Coast \u2013 AvalonSydney \u2013 AvalonKangaroo Island\u00a0Adelaide - Kingscote\u00a0\u00a0  Flights, routes and the total number of tickets will be driven by demand and are subject to final discussions with the airlines\u00a0Advertisement\nAlso in the package, companies getting JobKeeper payments will be offered a government-backed 10-year loan of up to $5million, with no repayments due for two years.Some 350,000 employees now on JobKeeper could have their wages subsidised by the loans if their company decides to take one.\u00a0The prime minster said the package was Australia's 'ticket to recovery'.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tourism Minister Dan Tehan urged Aussies to support fellow countrymen by booking a holiday.'The thing our tourism operators want more than anything is tourists so we need Australians to do their patriotic duty and book a holiday this year because every dollar spent on an Australian holiday is a dollar that supports a local job and a local business,' he said.\u00a0The minister also warned state premiers not to close their borders at the first sign of a Covid-19 outbreak after they failed to agree on when borders should be slammed shut.\u00a0         Tickets to and from 13 holiday hotspots such as Alice Springs (pictured) will be subsidised by the federal government until July 31 and airlines will ramp up their flight schedules to deal with an expected surge in demand'We need states and territories to do their part by agreeing to a nationally consistent approach to using border closures and lockdowns as a last resort on medical advice,' he said.\u00a0The government is also extending a range of existing support policies to help the economy recover after its first recession since the early 1990s.The $50million Business Events Grants Program will be extended by three months to help companies hold multi-day business events by covering up to 50 per cent of costs.

        "full article": "By Dan Whitcomb LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Reuters) - Los Angeles Police Department commanders planned poorly for violent protests and looting that broke out following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, leading to a chaotic and inadequate response, an independent review said on Thursday. The review, commissioned by city leaders following nationwide demonstrations and rioting last year, was released as the trial opens in Minneapolis for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with killing Floyd on May 25, 2020. \"On May 27 and 28, the protests in downtown Los Angeles were marred by an escalating level of violence and criminality. Initially, the (Los Angeles Police) Department treated these as isolated incidents, rather than as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across the United States,\" the report said. The LAPD did not immediately respond to the report. The review, headed by criminal defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, found that LAPD commanders failed to establish a clear command structure for directing its response to the outbreak of violence, leading to a \"chaos of command\" that left officers unsure of who was in charge as events unfolded. \"It appears the Department believed that if protests arising out of George Floyd\u00b4s death occurred in Los Angeles that they all would be peaceful,\" the report's authors said. \"In interviews with the Review Team, interviewees said they were surprised at the violence that occurred in the afternoon and evening hours at some protests.\" Other mistakes cited in the analysis included poor training of officers in use of non-lethal weapons, failing to anticipate that the protests could spread beyond the city's downtown and lack of field jails. \"Thousands of people were arrested throughout the protests without a clearly articulated plan for detentions, transportation and processing,\" the report said. \"Those arrested were detained at the scene of the arrests for hours, handcuffed on the pavement, detained in buses, and taken to remote locations, without water or the use of bathroom facilities.\" (Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; editing by Grant McCool)",

        "title": "Pace of spending for pandemic aid? Try $43,000 every second",
        "full article": "BALTIMORE (AP) - To pay out his coronavirus relief package, President Joe Biden must spend an average of $3.7 billion every day for the rest of this year. That\u00b4s $43,000 every second of every day until midnight chimes on 2022. For the amount of time that readers took to reach this sentence, Biden needs to disburse nearly $800,000 to stay on track. That's according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, and even then, the Biden administration would still have plenty of the $1.9 trillion to spend in later years as a vaccinated country battles back to economic health. The president signed the aid package into law Thursday without a comprehensive plan in place to distribute all of the funds, which will be a core focus of the administration in coming weeks. The level of spending is a testament to the complexity of addressing a disease that seeped so widely across the nation in less than a year, and the economic pain that it has wrought. \"It\u00b4s taxpayer money that you want to put out fairly, but you also want to put out fast,\" said Jack Smalligan, a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute and a former White House budget official.          President Joe Biden leaves after signing the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief package, in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  Some spending, such as cash transfers, can occur at speed. The Biden administration already announced that it will send the $1,400 in direct checks -- a total of about $400 billion--starting this weekend. The administration also will continue the enhanced jobless aid for the 20.1 million Americans who are collecting some form of the benefits. Both the direct checks and jobless aid were part of past COVID aid packages that totaled roughly $4 trillion, meaning the government has systems in place to distribute the money. But other elements are trickier. There is $130 billion for K-12 schools to hire teachers, upgrade ventilation systems and make other improvements so that in-person classes can resume. Universities are eligible for $40 billion. Separately, $30 billion in housing aid is available. And there is about $120 billion for vaccine distribution and coronavirus testing, among other public health expenses. The White House said the billions for schools would \"begin\" to be distributed this month by the Education Department. But some funds could take time to distribute, since government agencies with their normal spending can take six to nine months to release funds through competitive grants or an application process. Schools and state and local governments also might spread out spending to well after most of the country is vaccinated. \"A fair process can inherently take longer because of the checks and balances and the internal reviews,\" Smalligan said. \"Having the money flow out quickly and then having state and local government spend the money over the next two fiscal years is probably responsible on their part. You want to be hiring a teacher not for a month but for years.\" The Treasury Department is planning how to best distribute roughly $350 billion in state and local aid. But it hasn\u00b4t finalized a plan and is consulting with governors, mayors and other officials. \"Our Treasury team is going to work to get this aid out as in the quickest way possible - and the one that produces the greatest impact,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said at a Tuesday speech for the National League of Cities. \"To do that, we\u00b4re going to need your input and advice.\" The Biden package also introduces about $140 billion in temporary tax credits. This includes an expanded child tax credit that would pay out monthly, rather than once a year. Parents with incomes below $150,000 could receive at least $250 a month per child beginning in July. \"The real troubles are going to show up in these new tax credit programs: Can the IRS administer this new monthly payment to tens of millions of American families?\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. Holtz-Eakin said the error rates on these tax credit programs tend to be high, since people move to new addresses, earnings change and the IRS might not have the correct ages for children. He noted that about a quarter of payments for the existing earned income tax credit that go to working parents are in error. However, he also noted that there are few economic risks to Biden in terms of how the money gets released, since the economy was already poised to expand swiftly at the strongest rate in at least two decades. Holtz-Eakin said the successful distribution of the funds would really influence two goals that he views as tangential to pandemic relief. First is the reduction in child poverty promoted by the Biden team through the tax credits and other aid. But secondly, the assorted child tax credits will expire and that puts pressure on Republican lawmakers to not block their extension before the 2022 elections. That pressure could help Democrats in their push to expand narrow majorities in the House and Senate. \"It\u00b4s a clear political trap that they\u00b4re trying to set up,\" Holtz-Eakin said. But the spending in the Biden package also reflects how much has changed after the nation went into lockdown a year ago. Back then, the rapid aid was needed because of the mass layoffs as businesses shuttered. Now, money is needed to accelerate the recovery because vaccines are available. \"There is a light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Kathleen McKiernan, an economics professor at Vanderbilt University. \"Biden\u00b4s plan targets areas of need, including vaccine distribution and state and local government aid, which will take time but will help the economy bounce back after the virus is controlled.\"          President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, arrive at the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Washington.

        "full article": "By Jem Aswad LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - When the 2021 Grammy Award nominations were announced in November, thousands of people were stunned to see that the Weeknd -- one of the most commercially and critically successful artists of the past year, whose single \"Blinding Lights\" just became the first song ever to spend a full year in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 -- was not nominated for any awards. The inexplicable and/or suspicious snub, the biggest in Grammy history, could only be explained as the work of the \"secret committees\" of industry veterans, executives and artists who determine the nominees in certain, but not all, categories. The work of the committees was singled out in a blockbuster legal complaint by Deborah Dugan, who was ousted as president/CEO of the Recording Academy after just eight months, as a symbol of longstanding corruption within the Grammy bureaucracy. While the Weeknd and his team had basically allowed the situation to die down in recent weeks, as he performed as the Super Bowl's headlining halftime performer last month, it flared up again on the Thursday before the Grammys when he said in a statement to the New York Times that he will boycott the awards, at least until change is instituted. \"Because of the secret committees,\" the Weeknd said, \"I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys.\" It's certainly possible that none of the committees -- or the voters for the categories that don't have secret committees -- didn't give the Weekend enough votes, or that some computation-process oddity was responsible for the snub. But few really believe it, and multiple theories have been posited, most commonly that someone, and it's not clear who, simply didn't want the Weeknd to perform at both the Grammys and the Super Bowl, which were originally scheduled just a week apart (the Grammys were moved from Jan. 31 to this Sunday due to a coronavirus spike in Southern California). That theory is made even more confusing by the fact that the Weeknd, the NFL, CBS (which broadcasts both the Grammys and the Super Bowl) and Super Bowl halftime advisor Roc Nation held extensive meetings and worked out the situation so that he could do both -- only to have the situation become moot days later, when the Weeknd was excluded from the nominations and effectively out of the running to be a performer on the show. Asked about the snub by Variety on the day the nominations were announced, interim Grammy chief Harvey Mason jr., who replaced Dugan, declined to find fault with the Academy's process, saying, \"it really just comes down to the voting body that decides. We have eight nomination slots to fill in [the \"Big Four\" categories: Best Album, Song, Record and New Artist], five in others, and the voters vote for their favorites.\" Asked again about the situation earlier this week, Mason told Variety: \"Some of it was [decided by] the nominating committees and some was the voting body, because some of the awards he was eligible for did not have nominating committees, so it was a combination of both. But again, it's unfortunate, we never like to see somebody as talented as the Weeknd get left out or feel left out. It's not something any of us are happy about.\" Asked if the egregious snub means that the Academy will consider changing its rules at its forthcoming board meetings in May, he said, \"The process is definitely something that we're going to continue to look at and continue to make sure that it's evolving as music continues to evolve,\" adding \"I'll hopefully have more things to talk about in the future.\" Mason, who is also chair of the Academy's Board of Trustees, is expected to step down for a new, permanent president/CEO in May, although the selection process is still underway. Wassim Slaiby, the manager of the Weeknd (Abel Tesfaye), told the Times an email interview that it was still unclear why his client was not nominated. \"We were many weeks and dozens of calls in with the Grammy team around Abel's performance right up to the day of nominations being announced,\" said Slaiby, who is known as Sal. \"We were scratching our heads in confusion and wanted answers.\" Reps for the Weeknd, his label, Republic Records, and the Recording Academy did not immediately respond to Variety's requests for further comment. Slaiby said he hopes the Weeknd's stand inspires other artists to speak out against the secret committees. \"The Grammys should handle their legacy and clean it up to raise the bar to a level where everyone could be proud to hold up that award,\" he said. \"This is Harvey's chance to step up and have his legacy be the guy who got the Grammys finally right.\"",

        "full article": "BUCHAREST, March 11 (Reuters) - Romanian authorities have temporarily stopped vaccinating people with one batch of AstraZeneca\u00b4s COVID-19 vaccine as an \"extreme precaution\" while deaths in Italy are investigated, but are continuing to use other doses from the company, a health agency said on Thursday. Italian health authorities have ordered the withdrawal of a batch of AstraZeneca's vaccine following the deaths of two men in Sicily who were recently inoculated, a source close to the matter said on Thursday. Romania said it has suspended using doses from the same batch in question in Italy, adding it received 81,600 doses in early February and has used 77,049 so far. The suspension will last until the European Medicines Agency completes a probe. \"This decision was made as a measure of extreme precaution without there being a scientific argument present in Romania to justify it,\" Romania's national committee in charge of COVID-19 vaccination said in a statement. \"The decision to quarantine the respective batch was made exclusively based on the event reported in Italy.\" Separately, health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland on Thursday suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine following reports of blood clots in some people who were vaccinated, while Austria stopped using a batch of shots while investigating a death. Romanian officials said the country did not receive doses from the batch suspended in Denmark and other states. Romania reported 5,236 daily new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest number so far this year. More than 1.1 million Romanians have received at least one shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca's vaccines in the European Union country of 20 million.

        "full article": "Cade Cunningham recorded 17 points and eight rebounds to help No. 12 Oklahoma State register a 72-69 victory over No. 10 West Virginia on Thursday in the Big 12 tournament quarterfinals at Kansas City. Avery Anderson scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half for the fifth-seeded Cowboys (19-7), who won for the seventh time in the past eight games. Isaac Likekele and Bryce Williams added 10 points apiece and Kalib Boone contributed 10 rebounds and six blocked shots. Miles McBride and Taz Sherman scored 19 points apiece for West Virginia (18-9), which lost for the third time in the past four games. Derek Culver recorded 11 points and nine rebounds and Sean McNeil scored 10 points for the fourth-seeded Mountaineers. Culver played 30 minutes while laboring through a non-COVID-19 illness. He reportedly was given an IV at halftime. Oklahoma State will play the winner of the contest between top-seeded Baylor and ninth-seeded Kansas State in Friday's semifinals. The Cowboys shot 44.3 percent from the field -- including 6-of-19 from 3-point range -- but held a dominating 45-32 rebounding edge. West Virginia shot 42.4 percent and was 7-of-23 from behind the arc. The Mountaineers battled back from a 10-point deficit to take a 69-68 lead on Sherman's 3-pointer with 1:14 remaining. Anderson drove for a layup to put Oklahoma State back ahead with 55.1 seconds left and Williams added two free throws to make it 72-69 with 21.3 seconds remaining. West Virginia had a chance to force overtime but came up empty. Sherman had a 3-point attempt blocked by Likekele and Culver recovered the ball for the Mountaineers and got it to McNeil, who didn't get the shot off in time despite it swishing the net. West Virginia coach Bob Huggins failed for the second straight time in his bid to join Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Boeheim, Bob Knight and Roy Williams as the only male coaches with 900 Division I victories. McBride scored 16 first-half points as the Mountaineers held a 36-30 edge. Culver re-entered with 17:03 remaining in the contest and scored the next two Mountaineers' baskets. He converted another shot to make it 47-39 with 13:35 remaining. Oklahoma State answered with a 16-3 spurt to move ahead. Cunningham buried a 3-pointer to give the Cowboys a 51-50 edge with 10:12 left. Likekele and Anderson added baskets to conclude the flurry and give Oklahoma State a five-point lead. Cunningham's running hook shot made it 62-52 with 6:18 left. The lead was again 10 before Sherman made two 3-pointers and converted a layup following a steal during a 10-1 run to pull West Virginia within 65-64 with 3:55 remaining. --Field Level Media",

Newly unearthed footage of Prince Charles and Diana's infamous engagement interview has emerged, showing the Princess of Wales looking 'clearly dissatisfied' after her husband-to-be's comments asking if the couple were 'in love'.Royal biographer Angela Levin said that the interview was one of the early signs showing the difference and potential problems between the Spencers and Windsors.'Diana really couldn't be a Spencer and show what she felt she had to be a Windsor, to keep it all under wraps,' she said.'Charles was baffled as to how to answer a question that was about his emotions.\u00a0'Don't forget he had been brought up by the Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh to hide what they felt,' she added.\u00a0\u00a0         On February 24, 1981, after months of speculation, a 32-year-old Charles who had long 'needed' to find a bride was marrying an excited 19-year-old then known as Lady Diana Spencer.

The clip usually cuts off immediately after Charles' comment, but new footage, airing on Channel 5 on Sunday, shows the royal's face drop and show clear dissatisfaction at Charles' blunder (pictured)She claimed she was 'silenced' by Buckingham Palace officials, who told her to always answer 'no comment' because they would 'protect' her, adding: 'It was only once we were married and everything started to really worsen that I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family, but they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband.'Meghan told Oprah she later reached out to one of Dian'a's best friends because she felt unsupported by the palace, and\u00a0said Harry had 'saved [her] life' by agreeing to move to Los Angeles.After the two-hour Oprah interview aired in the US on CBS on Sunday, American filmmaker\u00a0Ava DuVernay shared a clip from Diana's 1995 interview with BBC Panorama to Twitter.

        "title": "US STOCKS-S&P 500, Dow end at record highs after upbeat jobless claims data",
        "full article": "By Karen Pierog and Herbert Lash March 11 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow closed at all-time highs on Thursday as worries about rising inflation subsided, while a bigger-than-expected fall in weekly jobless claims and the signing of a massive stimulus bill reinforced expectations of a strong economic recovery. Mega-cap stocks Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc led the rally, recouping losses from a recent pullback and helping the benchmark S&amp;P 500 surpass its Feb. 12 close of 3,934.83. The blue-chip Dow scaled a new record for the fourth straight session, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is now less than 5% below its Feb. 12 peak after slumping over 10% to confirm a correction at the beginning of this week. President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law on Thursday, commemorating the one-year anniversary of a U.S. lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic with a measure designed to bring relief to Americans and boost the economy. The relief package, on top of the ongoing recovery fueled by the coronavirus vaccination rollout and fading fears of inflation, were driving the market, said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede in Philadelphia. While tech led Thursday's advance, there was still a rotation into value stocks, which have outperformed high-priced growth stocks since November. \"There is a recovery in the valuations of those companies more impacted by the epidemic and a giveback of the valuations of those companies that were more insulated and maybe even perhaps benefited from the pandemic,\" Pride said. \"Markets are trading at valuation extremes at this point,\" he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188.57 points, or 0.58%, to 32,485.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 40.53 points, or 1.04%, to 3,939.34 and the Nasdaq Composite added 329.84 points, or 2.52%, to 13,398.67. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.02 billion shares, compared with the 14.871 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. Fewer than expected Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week as vaccinations allow more segments of the economy to reopen. \"The drop in jobless claims is another win for the week, and a solid sign that we're making some strides toward pre-pandemic life,\" said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial. The latest U.S. Treasury auction -- $24 billion of 30-year bonds -- did not reignite inflation concerns unlike a weak seven-year note auction last month that helped send yields higher, spooking markets. \"That story line has dissipated a little bit,\" said Pride, pointing to tame consumer prices data for February. The S&amp;P 500's industrials and communication services sectors reached all-time highs. Wall Street's fear gauge hit a two-week low at 21.45 points before ending at 21.91, a sign of easing fears over inflation. Coupang, backed by SoftBank Group Corp, ended the day valued at $85 billion on Thursday after investors in South Korea's largest e-commerce company raised around $4.6 billion in the biggest U.S. initial public offering this year. SoftBank racked up a roughly $33 billion paper gain after Coupang's stock soared 81% to open at $63.50, and later pared gains to close up 40.7% at $49.25. Bumble Inc jumped 10.8% after it reported a bigger-than-estimated rise in fourth-quarter revenue and said it expected pent-up demand from people who had been avoiding dating in person due to the pandemic. A so-called \"meme\" stock AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc gained 4.36% as the cinema chain said the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the release of major movies would boost sales this year. Oracle Corp slumped 6.5% as the business software maker's cloud division reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' estimates on increased competition from Amazon.com and Microsoft. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.87-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&amp;P 500 posted 74 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 327 new highs and eight new lows.

It was just one of those things that evolved while planning our renovations and suited our lifestyle perfectly. We are very sociable but with young children and busy careers, and relished the opportunity to create a fun and relaxed space in which to entertain family and friends. And thank goodness we did.Jon made the bar mostly out of kitchen base units and MDF panelling. It has a black granite worktop and splashback and a white Carrera marble countertop. There are mirrored metro tiles on the back wall and two glass shelves housing a large selection of spirits.It all looks very pretty in the evening when we switch on the fairy lights and the mirrors bounce the light around.There\u2019s a proper beer pump \u2014 I love pulling a pint! \u2014 and I bought Jon a cocktail-making kit so he can now rustle up the perfect mojito.Two sets of French doors overlook the garden on each side, and are framed with luxurious teal velvet curtains which make it feel cosy at night.Roll on the day we can invite friends for a cheeky lock-in. But in the meantime, our cocktail lounge provides us with a lot of family fun and somewhere to \u2018go\u2019 for a change of scene.

        "full article": "ZURICH (AP) - A Swiss court ruled that a special prosecutor investigating Switzerland\u00b4s former attorney general acted illegally while pursuing a separate case against FIFA president Gianni Infantino, soccer\u00b4s governing body said Thursday. Prosecutor Stefan Keller said in December that Infantino should face a criminal investigation for disloyal management by using a FIFA-booked private jet from Suriname to Geneva in 2017. Infantino had visited soccer federations in the Caribbean. \"Now it is clear that this unfounded and defamatory statement was made on the basis of an investigative act which was itself illegal, null and void,\" FIFA said. In a statement, Keller\u00b4s office said the Swiss federal criminal court ruled he did not have the authority to conduct an interview in November with someone close to Infantino about the use of the jet. The transcript of the interview will be removed from any investigation. Keller was appointed by lawmakers last year to examine formal complaints by Swiss citizens against former attorney general Michael Lauber and Infantino. They had undisclosed meetings in 2016 and 2017 while Lauber led an investigation of international soccer officials. Lauber was ousted last year.

        "title": "Water restored, but most of Jackson still under boil notice",
        "full article": "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Most people in Mississippi\u00b4s capital now have running water, more than three weeks after the majority of taps in the city of 161,000 went dry during a winter storm. Still, officials said Thursday that thousands will likely remain under a boil-notice into next week. \"Based off of what we\u00b4re seeing right now, checking fire hydrants, checking pressure, we do believe that the connections on the city service right now should have water,\" Public Works Director Charles Williams said during a briefing. Williams said there still might be isolated pockets of Jackson with low water pressure because of elevation and distance from the water treatment facilities. Overall, however, he said he's feeling optimistic. Residents have been boiling water to cook, clean and brush their teeth since a winter storm passed through the region Feb. 15 and froze machinery at one of Jackson\u00b4s water treatment plants. Jackson on Wednesday received preliminary clearance to lift the boil-water notice on its 16,000 well water connections. The city has around 43,000 surface water connections still under advisory. The city has begun testing the water, and Williams said officials hope to have samples they can give the state Health Department by the end of the weekend. The quality of those samples will determine whether the boil advisory can be lifted.          The faculty and students at Provine High School served prepared meals and distributed bottled water, Thursday, March 11, 2021 in Jackson, Miss. The Jackson Public School District set up sites at several schools to help residents who still are under a boil water notice. Over 400 meals were given out as well as cases of water that school officials hope will be used for cooking since although water pressure has generally returned to much of the city, the water has yet to pass water quality tests. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)  For Jackson, getting water pressure back and the boil advisory lifted are only the first steps to addressing deeper issues with the water system. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said the crisis has been caused in part by decades of neglect of aging infrastructure. Parts of Jackson\u00b4s water system are a century old, he said. A major factor affecting the city\u00b4s ability to update its system has been a rapidly declining tax base due to \"white flight.\" Jackson\u00b4s tax base began crumbling decades ago, starting after the integration of public schools. Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize the water system and other infrastructure. A week ago, the Democratic mayor wrote a letter to Republican Gov. Tate Reeves and other officials to request $47 million in state and federal funding to begin repairing the water system. Since then, the mayor and other city leaders have begun meeting with legislative leaders to discuss options. \"There were deficiencies at the plant prior to the storm that we have been working with the EPA on, we want to try to get those addressed if we get funding and we also want to make improvements in the distribution system,\" Williams said Thursday. \"We believe that working those two areas right there will help us consistently keep the pressure up where it needs to be,\" he continued. Williams said officials are hoping for federal COVID-19 relief funds or other appropriations so they can repair wastewater collection and water distribution systems. \"The work does not stop right now,\" Williams said. \"It's just now beginning.\" ___ Leah Willingham is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        "full article": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was frustrated by the way Manchester United blew victory at the death and allowed AC Milan to grab a potentially crucial away goal in this Europa League tie. Despite being second best for much of Thursday\u2019s last-16 first leg, the Red Devils looked set to head to San Siro next week in the driving seat thanks to teenage substitute Amad Diallo\u2019s first goal for the club. The 18-year-old became the club\u2019s fourth youngest European goalscorer thanks to his superb, improvised header \u2013 a fine effort that was cancelled out deep in stoppage time. United\u2019s soft underbelly from set pieces was exposed when Simon Kjaer met a corner with a header that Dean Henderson will be frustrated not to have kept out as the first leg ended 1-1. \u201cWe dropped too deep in the box so the structure, there\u2019s a yard or two deep from everyone, really,\u201d Solskjaer said of the equaliser. \u201cOf course you\u2019re always disappointed when you concede a goal in that manner. \u201cSimon Kjaer is obviously a good player, he makes a good run, he\u2019s strong and his marker gets blocked off, so he gets in front of him. \u201cDisappointed but then again that can happen. I\u2019ve been part of a team that\u2019s scored in injury time in Europe myself on a set play. \u201cWe know we have to travel there and score a goal and win the game, or score two and draw. \u201cOf course it makes it more difficult. Always when you concede at home, you\u2019re never happy when you do. \u201cOne minute before full time is also disappointing but we\u2019ve got to take that on the chin and just travel down there next week and go for it.\u201d On the impact of the away goal on the round of 16 tie, Solskjaer added: \u201cIt makes it harder but it makes us have to go down there and score goals and win the game. \u201cThat might suit us. It probably will suit us. We\u2019re a team that\u2019s better when we go forward, more direct. \u201cToday we didn\u2019t win the ball well enough or in good enough positions to find the counter attacks. \u201cWe were too slow, we didn\u2019t move our feet well enough in our half and they played well, to be fair, as well.\u201d Solskjaer was annoyed by several aspects of his side\u2019s display against depleted Milan, who travelled to England without the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Theo Hernandez and Ante Rebic. All to play for in Italy next week \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udd34 #MUFC\ud83c\udfc6 #UEL https://t.co/IhcMKRQws3\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 11, 2021   The Red Devils boss was without key men of his own, with the absence of Marcus Rashford and Edinson Cavani compounded when Anthony Martial was forced off with a hip issue. January signing Diallo replaced the Frenchman at the break and made quite the impression, scoring his first United goal just five minutes after coming on. \u201cI think the pass was incredible,\u201d Solskjaer said of Bruno Fernandes\u2019 assist. \u201cI think the pass more or less made the goal, the keeper\u2019s position as well. The flick is probably the only thing he can do and he should do. \u201cBut perfect timing, perfect little weight on the flick. Great moment for the kid.\u201d Milan boss Stefano Pioli was proud of his team\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d spirit at Old Trafford, with Kjaer securing the positive result their performance deserved. \u201cWe are working to grow and bring Milan back where we belong,\u201d said the Rossoneri boss, who was annoyed to see Franck Kessie\u2019s early opener ruled out for handball. \u201cThese are the best games in that sense, so I was happy to face a team like United. \u201cIt was a great performance and a great result, but we need another perfect performance to qualify against such a strong team. \u201cI keep repeating to my players that I\u2019m not coaching a normal group. This an extraordinary group, the lads always give their 100 per cent in every game, they are just incredible. \u201cBefore the game we would have been very happy with a 1-1 draw. Tonight we know that we could have earned even more after this performance.\u201d",

        "full article": "DUBLIN, March 11 (Reuters) - Ireland's Davy Stockbrokers, which is grappling with the fallout from a record central bank fine, has decided to put itself up for sale, the firm said on Thursday. Ireland's largest stockbroker, Davy was fined last week after an inquiry into 16 of its staff who the regulator alleged sought to profit in 2014 by taking the opposite side of a bond deal with a client, without telling the client or compliance officials. Davy closed its bond desk on Monday after it was dropped as a primary dealer in Irish government bonds and the central bank said on Tuesday it remained under close regulatory scrutiny following the 4.1 million euros ($4.9 million) fine. \"The Board of J&amp;E Davy has decided to pursue a sale of the Group,\" it said in a statement, adding that Rothschild &amp; Co had been appointed as financial adviser to manage the process. The Irish Times reported on Wednesday that Bank of Ireland , the country's largest bank by assets, had made an \"exploratory approach\" to Davy. Spokesmen for both Bank of Ireland and Davy declined to comment on the newspaper report. The 16 Davy staff members accused by the central bank of breaching market rules included then-Chief Executive Brian McKiernan, who quit on Saturday alongside two other senior executives. Irish government ministers have raised concerns, however, that McKiernan and others involved still retain a large stake in the business. Davy is an independent company wholly owned by management, staff and former employees. Allied Irish Banks last week bought one of Davy's main rivals, Goodbody Stockbrokers, a leading Irish provider of wealth management, corporate finance and capital markets services. Davy is also the country's largest wealth manager, with around 8.5 billion euros of assets under management, and is a corporate broker for some of the largest firms listed on the Irish stock exchange.

        "full article": "Brett John Callaghan faces up to 20 years jail time for the horrific attack on the 12-year-old last April\u00a0It is the haunting conversation that will alarm every parent - the moment a stranger lured a 12-year-old Sydney girl alone from a park and into his car so he could drug and rape her.\u00a0Court documents have laid bare the evil tactics of predator Brett John Callaghan, 38, who faces 20 years behind bars over a nine-and-a-half hour ordeal he inflicted upon the child last April.\u00a0Callaghan, 38, pleaded guilty to a series of charges this week, admitting what he did to the girl after approaching her and offering to charge her phone at his house 'down the road'.\u00a0According to a statement of agreed facts obtained exclusively by Daily Mail Australia, the child had been waiting for a friend to arrive at a Thornleigh park, about 3.30pm, on Tuesday, April 28, when Callaghan pulled up in a silver Mazda.\u00a0His daughter, 8, was in the car at the time.It was the school holidays and Callaghan's target had been in constant contact with her mum throughout the day. She had been left alone for just a few moments - a friend she had spent most of the day with had just been called home by his mum.\u00a0About 3.34pm, the girl was sitting alone in a stairwell when Callaghan asked her: 'What are you doing here?'         Family were alarmed when the schoolgirl failed to meet up with her mother on April 28 last year - disappearing instead of meeting her friend at the above park in Thornleigh\u00a0\u00a0The victim replied that she was waiting for a friend and supplied his first name, the court documents said.\u00a0Callaghan told her he knew a person with a similar name, leaving the victim with the impression he actually knew her mate.\u00a0They kept talking. During the conversation the girl told him she was 12-years-old. He asked her if she used drugs and also for what the time was.\u00a0The victim didn't know. Her phone was dead. According to the court document, the conversation continued as follows.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       How a girl, 12, is so traumatised she 'can't even watch TV'...

He couldn't find her.\u00a0For the victim, what followed was an ordeal that didn't end until 1.15am the next morning, many details of which are too distasteful to publish.\u00a0         The 12-year-old girl was taken to the offender's granny flat behind his parents' home in DuralThe girl's mother was alarmed when her daughter failed to show up at their meeting point at Hornsby as planned later that afternoon, the court heard.The mum\u00a0rang police, who quickly used CCTV footage to piece together whose car the girl had entered at Thornleigh.\u00a0Police attended Callaghan's home that evening.\u00a0The predator and his victim had already attended and left his granny flat, located out the back of his parents' acreage.Officers spoke to Callaghan's daughter, who confirmed the missing child had traveled in the car with them.\u00a0\u00a0The court documents, released this week, revealed that the girl twice attempted to flee from her abuser.\u00a0Early in the afternoon she tried to run from Callaghan's granny flat. Neighbours heard screams.\u00a0'I need my phone.

        "title": "RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The vengeful Left is cynically using a rift in the Royal Family to launch an all-out assault on the British press",
        "full article": "On an official visit to a school in East London, the Duke of Cambridge is ambushed by reporters desperate for a reaction to damaging allegations made by the Markles in their interview with Oprah Winfrey.'Is the Royal Family a racist family, sir?' hollers one of the media pack, to the visible discomfort of a black female member of staff accompanying the Duke and Duchess.Typical tabloid scum, hijacking a formal engagement to cause the maximum embarrassment to a family already reeling from uncorroborated accusations levelled against them by Harry and Meghan.Have these reptiles no respect? Are there no depths to which they will not sink in pursuit of a sensational headline?Disrupting a visit to promote a children's mental health programme is surely a new low, even by the dismal standards of the gutter Press.Except this wasn't one of Fleet Street's finest gatecrashing the occasion. The shouty inquisitor was Inzamam Rashid, from Sky News, who has just returned from suspension after flouting lockdown to attend his colleague Kay Burley's 60th birthday party.Nor was Rashid satisfied with demanding to know on camera whether the Royal Family is racist. He also yelled: 'Have you spoken to your brother since the interview?' William would have been justified in treating Rashid with the contempt he deserved. Instead he reacted with composed dignity, saying he intended to talk to Harry in due course, and denying the racism allegations.         On Thursday during an official visit to a school in East London, the Duke of Cambridge was ambushed by reporters desperate for a reaction to damaging allegations made by the Markles in their interview with Oprah Winfrey. Pictured: Prince William (left) and Kate Middleton (centre) on ThursdayWhat was he supposed to say? 'Is the Royal Family a racist family?' was straight out of the 'When did you stop beating your wife?' school of journalism.As Eric Morecambe used to say: 'There's no answer to that.'But it didn't stop Sky running the video every hour on the hour. Or BBC News doing the same, while simultaneously condemning newspapers for racism and tabloid excess.Like Boris Johnson, broadcasters are pro-having cake and pro-eating it. They have gleefully repeated all the wild allegations made during the Oprah interview, while pretending piously to remain aloof from the mores and modus operandi of the popular Press.Rolling news channels and radio stations have wheeled out panels of talking heads to pontificate on the alleged racism at Buckingham Palace and monster the newspapers for driving Harry and Meghan out of Britain.The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire tried to badger Ian Murray, of the Society of Editors, into admitting that the entire Press was racist on the strength of two or three headlines.This was just one of a montage of misleading headlines taken out of context and featured on the Oprah show as 'evidence' to support Meghan Markle's unsubstantiated slurs.Murray had put out a statement categorically denying that the Press is ' bigoted'. Yet rather than circling the wagons, sections of the newspaper industry turned on him for not being sufficiently 'anti-racist' and he has now resigned.Somehow, what started out as a squabble within the Royal Family has mutated into yet another full-frontal assault on the Press in particular and freedom of speech in general.         Somehow, what started out as a squabble within the Royal Family has mutated into yet another full-frontal assault on the Press in particular and freedom of speech in general.\u00a0The first casualty was Piers Morgan, who has walked the plank from Good Morning Britain because he said he didn't believe a single word of Meghan's lurid allegations, even though at least half his audience agree with him. Pictured: Morgan (left) with Susanna Reid (right) on Good Morning BritainThe first casualty was Piers Morgan, who has walked the plank from Good Morning Britain because he said he didn't believe a single word of Meghan's lurid allegations, even though at least half his audience agree with him.Piers is big enough and ugly enough to fight his own battles, and he'd probably had enough of getting up at 3am, anyway. Like Kenny, from South Park, he won't stay dead for long.But what should concern us is that ITV's boss Carolyn McCall appears to have caved into complaints not just from some of her own junior staff but also to an email from Markle herself.OK, so even Morgan now acknowledges he was wrong to question Meghan's claims to have entertained suicidal thoughts while trapped in her gilded royal cage.He was stepping into a minefield, especially as ITV is still recovering from the suicides of troubled Love Island presenter Caroline Flack, and a guest on the gruesome Jeremy Kyle show.Mental health issues, like race, are a guaranteed get-out-of-jail card in today's victim culture. Even if they can cover a multitude of conditions from severe depression to feeling a bit fed-up, criticism is a career-ending taboo.That's no excuse for McCall allowing ITV's breakfast show to be edited from California by the very woman being discussed on the programme. Since when did Meghan's remit extend to dictating the content of Good Morning Britain?       Equally disturbing is a report that the BBC took a call from a fancy PR firm hired by the Markles, demanding that debate on the fallout from the Oprah horror show should not be confined to 'old white men'.Still, that would explain why Radio 4's Nick Robinson cut off royal expert Hugo Vickers when he tried to explain the couple's claims about their son being denied a title and being left without security were factually inaccurate.The notion that the BBC is even entertaining editorial advice from a bunch of expensive West Coast spin doctors, employed by a pair of self-promoting multi-millionaires, is truly mind-boggling.Where were the BBC's famous 'fact-checkers' when Markle was speaking 'her truth' to Winfrey? None of her claims were backed up by any hard evidence, and certainly wouldn't stand up in a court of law.Yet because she spouts the fashionable drivel beloved of the 'liberal' Left and the wokerati, her sermon is treated as if it is carved on tablets of stone.It is nothing less than extraordinary the way the self-appointed cultural elites have embraced Meghan as an authentic voice of social justice.In Britain, she has been adopted unreservedly as living proof that the Royal Family, society in general and the evil Press in particular is riddled with endemic racism. Anyone who dissents must be cancelled, cast into the outer darkness.The usual suspects have pounced on her 'revelations' to reactivate their deranged crusade to shackle the Press and control speech. Sadly, but predictably, they have attracted a familiar roll-call of useful idiots, including Kath Viner, the editor of the Guardian \u2014 a newspaper once managed by Carolyn McCall, now of ITV.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: As the Queen's Flight is set to be sold...    RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Rishi keeps giving away money like...      RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: The pandemic has ushered in a baffling...      Share this article Share   A campaign of vilification against newspapers is currently being whipped up by vengeful Left-wing MPs and Hacked Off, an outfit which has boasted such distinguished champions of free speech as Nonce Finder General Tom Watson and IRA stooge Roy Greenslade, employed for years as the Guardian's impartial media commentator. Enemies of our free Press will seize any weapon to hand. For the past ten years, Fleet Street has been under siege, ever since rogue elements at the now defunct News Of The World were caught hacking mobile phones.Politicians still smarting from the exposure of the MPs' expenses scandal set up the Leveson Inquisition, which attempted to snare all newspapers including this one, even though the Mail had absolutely no involvement in phone hacking. Although Leveson didn't lay a glove on most newspapers, it raised the spectre of state control of the Press.That was headed off at the pass by the establishment of a beefed-up watchdog, IPSO, but \u2014 as Gerry Adams said of the IRA \u2014 it hasn't gone away, you know.Thanks to social media, IPSO is regularly inundated with vexatious complainants seeking to control what can and can't be published.So, too, is Ofcom, the body which regulates broadcast content and which reportedly received 41,000 complaints about Piers Morgan after a Twitter storm. Not so long ago, anyone wanting to lodge a complaint would have had to put it in writing. Most wouldn't have bothered.         Harry (left) and Meghan (centre) made several explosive claims about the Royal Family during an interview with Oprah Winfrey (right) on Sunday\u00a0Today, ironically for Piers, who has more than seven million followers on social media, those who live by Twitter, die by Twitter. Craven chief executives like McCall fold in the face of an apparent avalanche of complaints, most of them little more than empty emojis lazily retweeted.As a result, editorial independence is under threat as never before. There used to be a graffito outside Finsbury Park Tube station which read: 'Nothing is true, only what's permitted.'And what's permitted, what's 'true', are only those opinions of which the Left-wing cultural elite approve. ITV effectively sacks Piers Morgan for doubting Meghan's 'truth'. But the BBC backs presenters such as Victoria Derbyshire and Emily Maitlis when they hurl random allegations of 'racism' against newspaper journalists.The self-styled elites are all in favour of 'diversity', except when it comes to diversity of opinion. If they succeed in hobbling the Press, readers and viewers will end up with a one-track, homogenised world view.They want nothing that threatens their cultural and political hegemony. Which is why they hate popular newspapers.We have an unfortunate habit of telling the truth, as opposed to their 'truth'. Confronted with reality, they react like toddlers deprived of another rusk.Truth, real truth, is inconvenient. It's disruptive. They can't fault us when it comes to reporting the facts, so they resort to unfounded smears of racism, against which there is supposed to be no defence.But this newspaper has a proud record of standing against racists, most notably our exposure of the killers of Stephen Lawrence.Unlike some of the broadcasters, newspapers still understand the division between church and state, which is why we don't hesitate to turn over stones \u2014 even if that threatens governments, institutions such as the police, and, yes, even the Royal Family.Despite that, we wouldn't have published the allegations made by the Markles in the Oprah interview without firm proof.       We could do with more disruption here, not more conformity. What's wrong with having a Right-of-centre British TV channel? It would at least redress the balance. The British Left are obsessed with the 'bias' of Fox News. But if it wasn't for Fox, the American TV landscape would be dominated by wall-to-wall 'liberal' pro-Democrat channels, pumping out Left-leaning propaganda.American newspapers are no better. They're not dying because of new technology, they're dying because they're unreadable and have purged conservative voices from their pages, even though 72 million people voted Republican at the last election. The First Amendment doesn't apply at the New York Times or in the newsroom at MSNBC.No wonder the Americans are cheering on the Markles' campaign against the British Press, which is the most editorially diverse on the planet.And, for the record, in case Harry isn't aware, it wasn't the British newspapers that published a sickening photograph of his dying mother, slumped in the back of a Mercedes in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris, just moments after her fatal crash.It was that bastion of liberal values, that custodian of truth and justice, the home of Oprah Winfrey to whom he and his wife have just poured out their woes . . .CBS Television.Will you be speaking to your brother any time soon, sir?",

        "full article": "By Catarina Demony and Sergio Goncalves LISBON, March 11 (Reuters) - Nearly two months into a lockdown imposed in mid-January to tackle what was then the world's worst coronavirus surge, Portugal's government announced on Thursday it would start to gradually ease its strict rules from next week. \"We can open up in a safe way but it has to be a prudent, gradual opening, bit by bit ... we don't want to increase the risk,\" Prime Minister Antonio Costa told a news conference. \"We have to be cautious.\" Kindergartens, pre-schools and primary schools will reopen on Monday, as well as hair salons, libraries and bookshops, Costa said, adding that cafes' terraces, museums, and small stores will open doors on April 5. High school and university students will be able to return to school on April 19, when cinemas, theatres and shopping malls will also reopen. Outdoor events will be allowed under capacity rules. Restaurants can reopen on April 19 too but must close earlier. From May 3, restaurants can reopen with no time restrictions and large indoor and outdoor events can be held following capacity rules yet to be defined, Costa said, warning he will not be afraid to take a step back if the situation worsens again. The measures to ease the lockdown will be re-evaluated every 15 days, Costa said. In January, the pandemic brought the country's fragile health service to its knees but has significantly improved since then, with daily figures dropping sharply. Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million, reported 627 new cases and 18 deaths on Thursday, bringing the total to 812,575 and 16,635 respectively. https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi Controls on the country's land border with Spain will remain in place until Easter and travel restrictions, such as a negative COVID-19 test at arrival or quarantine, on those coming from the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa, will stay in force due to the new variants of the virus. In a presidential decree, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said that although the \"situation was evolving favourably ... external signs remained complex, imposing caution about the steps to be taken in the near future.\" No crisis in recent history has hit Portugal's tourism-dependent economy as hard, with the country's gross domestic product shrinking 7.6% last year, its biggest annual slump since 1936.

He's in on goal as well,' before commentator Peter Drury replied with a baffled expression, saying: 'Surely it has got to be checked [by VAR]'.Spurs fans reacted with fury on social media with one left frustrated by the inconsistencies of VAR by saying: 'VAR is in our game yet this wasn\u2019t given as a pen, not even looked at... someone make it make sense'.A fan account of the club claimed Jose Mourinho's side were robbed after saying: 'THFC have been absolutely robbed. Tanguy Ndombele should have a penalty after being fouled in the box'.One fan stated that while the contact was soft, there was no doubt it was still a foul, saying: 'That is a penalty. Soft, but it is a foul all day long. No touch on the ball, all the contact on Ndombele?'\u00a0         Spurs boss Jose Mourinho was incensed as he confronts the fourth official after the foul                                             Another jokingly replied they wanted an interview with American TV personality Oprah Winfrey to show their dismay.'Why is that challenge on Ndombele not a penalty in this era of madness? I demand an interview with\u00a0Oprah to express my angst!'While another fan suggested the Frenchman should have gone down immediately to win the spot-kick.'Because Ndombele didn\u2019t go down immediately and tried to get to the ball. You literally have to make a scene to get a penalty nowadays, no wonder every footballer rolls on the floor for a couple of minutes when they are fouled.'

But it is understood the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also determined not to amend their programme to avoid the subject.When Sky News reporter Inzamam Rashid shouted out two questions on their departure William did not blink. 'Sir, have you spoken to your brother since the interview?' he asked.The prince replied tersely: 'I haven't spoken to him yet, but I will do.'              Terse: William yesterday answered questions called out by Sky reporter on London school visit with Kate and an unnamed woman on whether the Royal Family was racist. 'We're very much NOT a racist family,' William replied to the questionThe Daily Mail understands that the once-inseparable brothers have not spoken for months. As William and Kate walked on, the reporter persisted: 'Can you just let me know, is the Royal Family a racist family?'William turned so his voice could be heard and said, clearly and firmly, despite his mask: 'We're very much not a racist family.'The frustration in his voice, and on his face, was clear.

They were welcomed by co-head teachers, Stephanie Shaldas and Edmund Coogan, and were introduced to some of the youngest pupils at a play session.Kate, in a pink Max & Co coat, knelt down to talk to children in a pop-up cafe, while William helped a girl building a wall in the playground's construction area.\u00a0Later he sat on a raised floor talking to a little boy who was brandishing a clipboard as Kate went to a water play area and then joined children in a sand pit hunting for treasure.'Is it fun to be back with all your friends?' she asked them.Kate and William then joined teachers and staff involved in the Mentally Healthy Schools project to talk about its aims and impact on children.They sat in a circle outside the school because of Covid restrictions. After the television reporter's questions were fired at William, it looked as though he may have apologised to Miss Shaldas for bringing his family's traumas into the playground.Andrea Silvain, a deputy head at the 1,200-pupil free school, said the last year of lockdowns had brought teachers and parents closer together and families had appreciated the help that the mental health website had given.'We've had some very positive feedback from parents,' she said.'People have been through this lockdown together,' William replied.Children at School 21, which educates around 1,200 pupils aged from four to 18, will be given access to lessons on issues such as anxiety and depression.Ironically, the lessons are on a website financed from an initial \u00a3800,000 grant from the then royal foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.Kate has championed the idea of early intervention by experts to help children struggling with mental health problems.Research shows that one in ten youngsters suffers from some kind of mental health issue, often because of problems in the family such as abuse, addiction, neglect or marital breakdown.On Thursday, Duchess of Sussex's biographer has published an email in which she demands aides release a statement claiming Kate drove her to tears at a bridesmaid dress fitting.Omid Scobie wrote yesterday that Harry and Meghan's exasperation with officials came to a head when Kensington Palace 'urgently requested' Harry join forces with them in co-signing a statement critical of a newspaper report.He said the palace wanted him to deny an 'offensive' article in The Times in January 2020 which claimed that Prince William had 'constantly bullied' the Sussexes before they decided to quit royal duties.He writes that a source revealed Meghan emailed an aide: 'Well, if we're just throwing any statement out there now, then perhaps KP can finally set the record straight about me [not making Kate cry].' He then says she asks why her side of the story was never considered important to anyone at the palace.           Mr Scobie alleged Meghan emailed a royal aide asking if Kensington Palace could 'set the record straight' about claims she made Kate cry during a children's dress fitting in 2018'But, as with many requests made by the couple, her suggestion was ignored,' he writes. 'The Duchess of Cambridge, she was told, should never be dragged into idle gossip.'The article was written for the website of US magazine Harper's Bazaar.The email was clearly a private one, sent by Meghan to only two or three of her most senior staff at most.Its quoting in full raises the question of how it came into the author's possession and was it leaked by the Duchess of Sussex herself?If not, then surely, critics asked yesterday, she would be complaining that a private email had been published without her knowledge.The issue is one that has clearly irked Meghan for some time as she raised it in her interview with Oprah Winfrey on Sunday night.The original story, published in a British broadsheet newspaper in 2018, claimed that Meghan had made Kate cry during a fitting for Princess Charlotte's bridesmaid dress, possibly in a row over whether she should wear tights.           Pictured: Kate Middleton during a visit to Stratford, east London todayIn the programme Meghan says: 'The truth? The reverse happened. A few days before the wedding, she was upset about something \u2013 yes, the issue was correct, about the flower girl dresses \u2013 and it made me cry and it really hurt my feelings.'She went on to claim that Kate apologised and brought her flowers and 'took accountability for it'.But Meghan said that no one at the palace was willing to help her set the record straight, even when friends asked if they could dispute the story for her through the media.'Everyone in the institution knew it wasn't true,' Meghan told Miss Winfrey, who asked: 'So why didn't somebody just say that?' Meghan replied: 'That's a good question.'Mr Scobie, who co-authored the Sussexes' biography Finding Freedom, went on to accuse Buckingham Palace of 'failing to acknowledge racism' aimed at a mixed-raced senior royal and questioned the monarchy's commitment to the ethnically diverse Commonwealth.And shockingly, Mr Scobie wrote: 'If it's not considered appropriate to acknowledge racism or racial ignorance when aimed at a mixed-raced senior royal, then how should the 54 countries of the Commonwealth and its predominantly black, brown, and mixed population feel about the realm's figurehead belonging to an institution that claims to celebrate 'diversity' but in practice appears to uphold white supremacy?'Since the screening of the interview, a raft of close friends and supporters have been given permission to push their case on social media and over the airwaves.Yesterday, Meghan's close friend\u00a0Janina Gavankar\u00a0firmly rejected the Queen's statement that 'recollections may vary' over the claims made by the Sussexes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The actress,\u00a0who has known Meghan for 17 years, said: 'Though their recollections may vary, ours don't.'She also said the duchess gave her backing before she appeared on TV - despite Meghan reportedly agreeing a period of silence to cool tensions with the Palace.\u00a0\u00a0Gavankar appeared on ITV's This Morning to insist the Sussexes were confident of their claims.          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  BBC's Charlie Stayt and Naga Munchetty mock Jenrick's 'small' flag       Watch video  Question Time audience member bravely details knife attack       Watch video  Young boy survives horrific fall from 23rd floor window       Watch video  Roofer unwittingly leaves voicemail insulting woman's appearance           Watch video  Donkey forces cow away from its food with powerful back kicks       Watch video  Food blogger on TikTok shares hack to keep lettuce fresh       Watch video  Robert Jenrick says UK still on course to end lockdown by June       Watch video  Brawl breaks out after anti-maskers force passengers off plane           Watch video  Woman breaks down in tears as she claims Armie Hammer raped her       Watch video  'Appalling': Patel condemns Boris's 'pat her on the bottom' comment       Watch video  Caroline Flack's twin sister says she was 'fascinated' by suicide       Watch video  Makeup artist shares her ultimate blush hack                         Janina Gavankar is pictured with Meghan Markle, whom she has been friends with for 17 yearsShe said:\u00a0'After reading this short statement that came out from Buckingham Palace today, I felt two things.'One side, I thought: I am so thankful that they are finally acknowledging the experience.'But on the other side, I am well aware that the family and the staff were well aware of the extent of it, and though their recollections may vary, ours don't, because we lived through it with them.

Sussexes delivered their damaging allegations of racism against the royal family four nights ago, but the Duke of Cambridge's admission that he has yet to speak to his brother is telling of the very depths of their divide.According to the Finding Freedom biography, their rift stretched back to before the wedding when Harry was angered by what he perceived as his brother's 'snobbish' attitude to Meghan, after William questioned whether he should rush into things with the ex-Suits star.Following the Queen's Sandringham summit in January, which was called to solve the Megxit debacle, William and Harry reportedly stopped speaking for two months.When younger, William and Harry's bond appeared unbreakable, and they were united in their experience of a royal childhood and the trauma of losing their mother.They were each other's best man on their wedding days, and Harry said when he was 21: 'It's amazing how close we've become.'I mean, ever since our mother died, obviously we were close, but he is the one person on this earth who I can actually really ... we can talk about anything.'We understand each other and we give each other support.'Broadcaster Tom Bradby, a friend of the Sussexes who interviewed them for a documentary about their Africa tour, wrote about the rift: 'The fallout began at the time of the wedding in 2018.'Really damaging things were said and done.'The atmosphere soured hard and early, but few meaningful attempts were made by anyone to heal the wounds.'He added: 'There is no doubt Harry and Meghan feel they have been driven out.'On July 1 this year, William and Harry are due to come together to unveil a statue they commissioned of their mother on what would have been her 60th birthday.The announcement last summer raised hopes the project would bring the brothers closer together.But now, amid the fallout from the shocking Oprah interview, that prospect looks uncertain.Advertisement\n'It would've been a big positive for them to talk candidly about how they got past that history, and possibly an injunction for people to be generous.'\u00a0Mr Moore then gives his own opinion: 'Yes, Harry could have helped young white men trying to tiptoe through this minefield.'Mr Phillips adds: 'That's assuming that Meghan actually knows about his past life \u2014 she seems remarkably ill-informed about the family she married into, even though it is the most famous and widely reported clan in history.'\u00a0Meghan said in the Oprah interview that she was so isolated and miserable as a working member of the royal family that she had suicidal thoughts.\u00a0She also said Harry told her that member of the royal family had expressed 'concerns' about the color of her baby\u00b4s skin before the birth of their son, Archie.Members of the royal family are known for ignoring the occasional questions shouted to them by the media during royal visits.\u00a0Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said: 'Imagine if Prince William had been in charge of the palace statement two days ago.'\u00a0\u00a0It comes as the Queen is set to extend a personal olive branch to Harry and Meghan as she takes charge of the fallout from their bombshell television interview.With senior royals still 'reeling' following a series of explosive allegations by the couple, she has issued a 'three-line whip' to prevent staff discussing the situation publicly.It is understood that she intends to try to pour oil on troubled waters by reaching out to her grandson and his wife in California instead.\u00a0The 94-year-old monarch's determination to seize the initiative is deemed to be a sensible one.Harry said he felt let down by his father, who, he claimed, refused to take his calls over the whole Megxit saga.During the interview, the 36-year-old also admitted there was still a huge gulf between him and his brother.He also accused an unnamed member of his family of racism and said the lack of support he and his wife received from the other royals was behind their decision to quit the UK.\u00a0However both Harry and Meghan made a point of trying to 'ring fence' his grandparents from criticism, with the duchess saying how 'wonderful' and generous the Queen had been.She also boasted of being able to call her without needing to speak to officials.\u00a0\u00a0         During the bombshell interview, Harry accused an unnamed member of his family of racism and said the lack of support he and his wife received from the other royals was behind their decision to quit the UK 'Their recollections may vary, ours don't': Meghan close friend attacks Queen's statement on Oprah interview\u00a0Meghan Markle's close friend has firmly rejected the Queen's statement that 'recollections may vary' over claims made by the Sussexes in their Oprah interview.\u00a0Janina\u00a0Gavankar, the actress, said: 'Though their recollections may vary, ours don't.'She also said the duchess gave her backing before she appeared on TV - despite Meghan reportedly agreeing a period of silence to cool tensions with the Palace.\u00a0The monarchy is reeling from the CBS interview, where the couple said a member of the royal family was 'concerned' over how dark Archie's skin would be, and that Meghan was\u00a0not given adequate support for her mental health.An eventual statement from the Queen promised to investigate the matter privately, but also appeared to contest their version of events.\u00a0Yesterday, Gavankar, who has known Meghan for 17 years, took appeared on ITV's This Morning to insist the Sussexes were confident of their claims.\u00a0She said:\u00a0'After reading this short statement that came out from Buckingham Palace today, I felt two things.'One side, I thought: I am so thankful that they are finally acknowledging the experience.'But on the other side, I am well aware that the family and the staff were well aware of the extent of it, and though their recollections may vary, ours don't, because we lived through it with them. There are many emails and texts to support that.'\u00a0Advertisement\nHarry also insisted he hadn't 'blindsided' her with their decision to step down from royal duties as he had too much respect for his 'colonel in chief'.\u00a0And he told Oprah to make clear in publicity for the show that the unidentified family member who Meghan claims expressed 'concern' about how 'dark' their child would be was neither of his grandparents.Courtiers now hope and believe the Queen's approach will help to 'de-toxify' such a volatile situation.'It is difficult to underestimate how shell-shocked everyone is by what has happened,' a source told the Daily Mail.'People are literally reeling from what has happened and some staff would dearly love to publicly rebut some of what has been said about them.'But the Queen has taken a very measured, sensible approach. She is leading by example. This is a matter for her and the family to deal with.'And although they had not been expecting to receive an easy ride, they were stunned at the ferocity of the allegations hurled in their direction.There was significant internal debate as to whether to rebut many of them, but instead the Queen personally opted for a 'compassionate but firm' approach.A statement on her behalf read: 'The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan.'The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.'She added: 'Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.'\u00a0The 61-word, three paragraph statement was in marked contrast to the three hours of interview Oprah boasted that Harry and Meghan had given her.\u00a0A source added: 'There is a long way to go but hopefully things will start to move in the right direction in order for bridges to be built.'It is hoped Harry and Meghan will now take the same approach.\u00a0Before the interview their PR team insisted it would be the 'last word' on the family rift.\u00a0         It is understood that the Queen intends to try to pour oil on troubled waters by reaching out to her grandson and his wife in California. It is expected that they will speak on the phone in the next few days       Meghan Markle made at least 13 trips abroad after her relationship with Prince Harry emerged - despite claiming her passport was seized when she 'joined the family' So much for a 'confiscated' passport! Meghan Markle took THIRTEEN foreign holidays despite claiming Palace aides seized IDs\u00a0Meghan Markle made at least 13 trips abroad after her relationship with Prince Harry emerged - despite claiming her passport was seized when she 'joined the family.'The Duchess of Sussex told Oprah she 'turned over' her passport alongside her driving licence and keys when she was welcomed into 'The Firm' in 2016.In her bombshell interview with the US talk show host - in which she also alleged she was 'silenced' by the Palace - the mother-to-be said 'all of that gets turned over' once you join the Royal Family.She added: 'When I joined that family, that was the last time I saw my passport, my driving licence, my keys - all of that gets turned over.'Meghan, 39, suggested she didn't see her passport again until she and Harry quit as senior royals and moved to California.However, it has emerged the Duchess visited 13 countries as a tourist from when she started dating Prince Harry to September 2019 - when the couple jetted off to Italy for fashion designer Misha Nonoo's lavish wedding.Meghan and Harry announced they were stepping back as senior members of the Royal Family the following January.Sources have claimed Meghan must have presented her passport to officials at 12 countries she visited during this period, the Sun reported.Although the Queen does not require a passport to travel, all other members of the Royal Family are required to carry one when heading abroad.\u00a0\u00a0Advertisement\nInsiders fear even if Harry does manage to patch up relations with his family, irrevocable damage has been done.\u00a0Palace staff watched Harry and Meghan's interview in horror as they claimed she was left completely unsupported when she joined the Royal Family, it emerged last night.The Daily Mail can reveal there is genuine hurt that the couple have perpetuated the image that Meghan was cut adrift and left to fend for herself.In fact, sources say, the duchess was given a string of the Queen's most senior staff as 'mentors' after the couple became engaged, as well as being allowed to hand-pick her own 15-strong team of loyal and talented private office staff.'It is very disingenuous to make such a sweeping generalisation,' one insider said.\u00a0'There was a brilliant team of very experienced and loyal aides to help them. Sadly, she and Harry were willing to listen to no one. And that is the honest truth.'The Queen even personally persuaded her long-standing and extremely popular former deputy private secretary Samantha Cohen, who had just handed in her notice after working for the Royal Household for the best part of two decades, to stay on and work for the couple.\u00a0She was their first joint private secretary, running their private and public lives rather like a chief of staff.\u00a0One of her main roles was to help navigate Meghan through the wedding and prepare her for royal life. These included regular tutoring sessions on everything from royal etiquette to diplomatic protocol at Kensington Palace.Australian-born Mrs Cohen, a mother of three, was considered the safest pair of hands possible.\u00a0Having begun her career in the press office, rising to press secretary, and then moving to the Queen's private office in 2010, she was the most senior woman in the household and one of the Queen's key advisers, seen in the palace corridors as belonging to a more modern breed of royal executive.\u00a0\u00a0'The Queen gave her Sam, her most trusted, her safest set of hands,' a source said. Yet Meghan told Oprah that while the Queen had personally been 'wonderful', she hadn't received any guidance on how to behave as a royal \u2013 leaving her forced to google the National Anthem.'Unlike what you see in the movies, there's no class on how to... how to speak, how to cross your legs, how to be royal,' she said.'There was none of that training that might exist for other members of the family. That was not something that was offered to me.''Nobody prepares you?' asked Oprah.\u00a0Meghan confirmed this adding: 'I'm sorry, but even down to, like, the National Anthem. No one thought to say, 'Oh, you're American. You're not gonna know that'.\u00a0'That's me, late at night, googling... I don't wanna embarrass them. I need to learn these 30 hymns for church.\u00a0'All of this is televised. We were doing the training behind the scenes 'cause I just wanted to make them proud.'She also revealed that on the first occasion she met the Queen, at Royal Lodge, Prince Andrew's Windsor home, his ex-wife the Duchess of York \u2013 with whom he still lives \u2013 had to teach her how to strike a 'deep curtsey' as she had no idea what she would be required to do that in private.Harry backed up his wife's claims, saying one of the main reasons for their decision to quit royal duties was a 'lack of support and lack of understanding'.\u00a0But several sources have told the Mail that their account 'is not one anyone recognises'.         During the interview, Meghan Markle described how 'wonderful' and generous the Queen (pictured together in 2018) had been and boasted of being able to call her without needing to speak to officials 'If you believe Archie has suffered racism then call me a Nigerian prince and give me your credit card': Candace Owens backs Piers Morgan\u00a0Conservative commentator Candace Owens has lashed out at Meghan Markle during an interview with Sean Hannity Wednesday night, describing the Duchess as a 'liar' and a 'narcissist'.\u00a0Owens told the Fox News anchor that Meghan 'couldn't keep her stories straight' during her bombshell interview with Oprah last weekend.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'She [Meghan] said she doesn't read newspapers or check social media. That's not true because she then said that she was suicidal because of bad press,' Owens stated.\u00a0         Conservative commentator Candace Owens has lashed out at Meghan Markle during an interview with Sean Hannity Wednesday night, describing the Duchess as a 'liar' and a 'narcissist'Owens also claimed that Meghan's insinuation that her son, Archie, was not offered a title because of his skin tone was also untrue.\u00a0'If you have seen a picture of Archie and you believe he suffered anti-black racism, then call me a Nigerian prince and give me your credit card,' the outspoken pundit proclaimed, saying that the baby Royal had a light skin tone.\u00a0Owens additionally mocked Meghan for putting in a complaint to British broadcaster ITV because she was upset with critical comments made by Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan.\u00a0\u00a0Advertisement\n'No one wants to get into a tit-for-tat but it is important to stress that this idea the duchess wasn't helped with protocol, that no one taught her to curtsey, she had to google the National Anthem herself, isn't true,' said one.\u00a0\u00a0It was alleged last week that Mrs Cohen was one of those members of staff who experienced bullying at Meghan's hands, which has been denied by the Sussexes' lawyers.As well as being given the services of Mrs Cohen, Meghan was also put on speed dial to the Queen's equerry, Ghanian-born Lieutenant Colonel Nana Kofi Twumasi-Ankrah of the Household Cavalry.\u00a0Equerries are senior officers who help organise the Queen's diary and official functions, often appearing at her side.The Mail also understands that Meghan was able to lean on one of the Queen's most senior ladies-in-waiting, Lady Susan Hussey, the widow of former BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey and one Prince William's godparents.She has been the loyal friend and companion to the Queen since she joined the court in 1960 following the birth of Prince Andrew.Like all ladies-in-waiting, Lady Susan accompanies Her Majesty on engagements and organises her diary, as well as dealing with her correspondence.\u00a0She is not paid for her services. Like Sam Cohen, there couldn't have been a safer sounding board for the duchess to use,' said a source.\u00a0'Lady Susan is very approachable, as are all the ladies-in-waiting, and would have wanted to help in any way they could.'In fact it was said that all of the ladies-in-waiting came over to Kensington Palace to have tea with Harry and Meghan's team... as a getting-to-know-you session.'The calibre of the team made available to Meghan was, sources say, a sign of how committed Buckingham Palace was to supporting her.'The intimation from the interview was that Harry, and particularly Meghan, were on their own,' one insider explained.'Of course no one could ever understand what it must be like being plunged into that world so quickly.'But that's why this team was assembled. Contrary to what has been suggested, Buckingham Palace has learnt from the mistakes of the past and were determined to help them in any way they could. They wanted to make Harry and Meghan a success.'Unfortunately they didn't want to listen. Harry was intrinsically distrustful of the institution and Meghan just really didn't want to know.'",

        "title": "Nevada Supreme Court mulls appeal in 2019 quadruple homicide",
        "full article": "RENO, Nev. (AP) - Nevada\u00b4s Supreme Court wants to hear directly from lawyers on both sides in a death penalty dispute over how much more time public defenders should have to try to prove a Salvadoran immigrant is intellectually disabled and can't be executed if convicted of four 2019 Nevada killings. The justices have scheduled oral arguments April 7 on one of two appeals filed by lawyers representing Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, 22. Public defenders say a Washoe County judge has illegally set a premature April 20 deadline to file a motion to declare him intellectually disabled - five months before the trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 20. The high court also is considering whether Washoe and Douglas counties' district attorneys can prosecute him in court in Reno for all four of the January 2019 homicides. His lawyers say the Washoe County grand jury that indicted him has no jurisdiction over two Douglas County killings. Prosecutors disagree. They argue the crimes are linked, partly because the same gun was used in all four killings during an 11-day crime rampage. Washoe County Chief Public Defender John Arrascada told Judge Connie Steinheimer during a July 2019 hearing he anticipated filing an intellectual disability motion that would bar Martinez-Guzman's execution.          FILE - In this May 20, 2019, file photo, Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, from El Salvador, appears in Washoe District Court in Reno, Nev. Nevada's Supreme Court wants to hear directly from lawyers on both sides in a death penalty dispute over how much more time public defenders should have to try to prove the Salvadoran immigrant is intellectually disabled and can't be executed if convicted of four 2019 Nevada killings. The justices have scheduled oral arguments April 7, 2021, on one of two appeals filed by lawyers representing Martinez-Guzman, 22. (Andy Barron/The Reno Gazette-Journal via AP, Pool, File)  Deputy Defender John Reese Petty said in their most recent Supreme Court filings the motion hasn't been filed yet because they\u00b4ve been unable to gather necessary evidence in Guzman\u00b4s native El Salvador due largely to COVID-19 travel restrictions. The defense says Steinheimer's deadline violates Nevada law, which gives defendants facing the death penalty up to 10 days prior to trial to file the motion. \"This court must allow him the opportunity to investigate, collect, analyze and marshal the best and most reliable evidence on his intellectual disability,\" Petty wrote. Nevada law defines \"intellectually disabled\" as \"significant sub-average general intellectual functioning which exists concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the development period.\" A clinical psychologist concluded in an evaluation that\u00b4s been sealed in district court that Martinez-Guzman\u00b4s general intellectual and cognitive test scores fell well below levels needed to satisfy key elements of Nevada\u00b4s execution exemption, the defense said. But the defenders say the vast majority of information concerning Martinez-Guzman\u00b4s formative years is in El Salvador, where he was born before coming to the United States at age 17. Federal officials have said he\u00b4s is in the U.S. illegally, but they don\u00b4t know how or when he arrived. Much of the dispute centers on Steinheimer\u00b4s insistence Martinez-Guzman\u00b4s legal team doesn\u00b4t necessarily need to travel to El Salvador. She has said that face-to-face interviews are preferable, but there\u00b4s \"no legal requirement that the interviews and assessments of informants be in person.\" She has pointed to \"technological advances ... being utilized around the world\u00b4\u00b4 and suggests alternatives such as video hookups. The defense argues that while such alternatives are used for gathering rudimentary information, they\u00b4re unacceptable in a capital case. \"The stakes are high,\" said Dr. Antonio Puentes, a bilingual neuropsychologist who testified for the defense at a hearing last July. He said if \"you want the real deal that stands up to science and stands up to any kind of legal challenge, then it is all face-to-face.\" Prosecutors haven\u00b4t responded since the Supreme Court set oral arguments. But they wrote in related filings opposing a stay in proceedings in district court - until after the high court rules - that Martinez-Guzman\u00b4s lawyers have made a \"tactical decision\" to wait until closer to the trial to file the disability motion because it will trigger an automatic stay. They argue Nevada law specifies only that such motions cannot occur less than 10 days before the trial date and doesn\u00b4t address whether a judge can set a deadline further out. \"The matter has been continued due to circumstances beyond the direct control of all involved,\" District Attorneys Chris Hicks of Washoe and Mark Jackson of Douglas wrote Monday. While the delay benefits Martinez-Guzman by allowing more time to further investigate his disability motion, they said, \"the effects of time wear on the recollection, health and availability of the witnesses that the state would use to support its case.\"",

        "full article": "The Hunt and Alpine Club in Portland, Maine had lobbied for funding for the restaurant industry included in President Joe Biden's $1.9 tn economic relief package  The beaten-down US restaurant industry is applauding the $28.6 billion in aid targeted at eateries in the massive economic rescue bill that President Joe Biden signed into law Thursday. The $1.9 trillion package establishes the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, a program the industry pushed for last year in the wake of a calamitous drop in revenues during the coronavirus pandemic. \"The creation of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund will be a catalyst to reviving restaurants and saving jobs across the country,\" Tom Bene, president of the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement. The fund provides a lifeline to one of the industries hardest hit by the pandemic shutdowns and restrictions. Foodservice sales have fallen by $255 billion and 110,000 restaurants have closed, the restaurant association said. Hundreds of thousands of restaurants garnered federal support from prior US relief packages through the Paycheck Protection Program, which provided forgivable loans to cover employee pay, rent and some other expenses. But restaurants had been pushing for a dedicated support program given the bruising impact of Covid-19 on the industry, which caused many to take on huge debts to survive. With the new fund, businesses can apply for a grant equivalent to the annual revenue loss from 2019 and 2020. Eligible expenses include payroll, rent, debt obligations to suppliers, protective equipment and outdoor seating construction. Chefs with the Independent Restaurant Coalition, which was formed in March 2020 as the Covid-19 crisis slammed the industry, also cheered the bill. \"This is more than a rescue plan. It is more than a relief package, it is literally a stimulus package that will really have an effect on the entire country's economy,\" said Los Angeles restauranteur Caroline Styne. \"This package will be the vehicle for so many small businesses, bars, and restaurants to survive: everywhere from down south in San Diego, to San Francisco, to Sacramento, and everywhere in between. It will help those who have been unemployed for almost a year now back to their jobs.\"",

Saints general manager Mickey Loomis announced Jenkins' release on Thursday, one day after New Orleans informed receiver Emmanuel Sanders and linebacker Kwon Alexander that they would be cut. Those were the latest among more than a handful of prominent veterans to be released, including tight ends Jared Cook and Josh Hill, and punter Thomas Morstead. The Saints also have yet to retain the services of defensive end Trey Hendrickson, the club's 2020 sacks leader, who is due to become a free agent next week. Cutting Jenkins will lower New Orleans' salary-cap figure by about $7 million. The Saints still needed to eliminate about $25 million in payroll by the time the new league year starts on Wednesday. Jenkins started all 13 games in which he played in 2020, tying for the team high in interceptions with three. He made 54 solo or assisted tackles and was credited with 12 passes defensed. ___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "title": "Amen to that, Wills! ROBERT HARDMAN hails Prince William's steely, wise reply as he publicly rejects Harry and Meghan's race claims against Royal Family",
        "full article": "He could have said nothing at all. In the circumstances, it would not have been surprising.The Royal Family do not normally respond to shouty potshots from the media on the basis that a) it only encourages more of the same and b) they are not politicians with an opinion on everything.This week, however, has been anything but normal. And the Duke of Cambridge is in a uniquely sad and painful position. His once-doting brother and his sister-in-law have landed a series of wounding blows on him, his family and his wife. They are accusations which will linger and fester for years to come.The most serious of them all \u2013 racism \u2013 has been presented in a manner so nebulous as to be almost unanswerable. All things considered, is it any wonder that when that was thrown at him point blank yesterday, he replied: 'We're very much not a racist family'.To which, I have no doubt, the vast majority of people in this country will say: 'Amen to that'.This sensible, steely intervention will be long-remembered in years to come.         The Royal Family do not normally respond to shouty potshots from the media on the basis that a) it only encourages more of the same and b) they are not politicians with an opinion on everythingWhen the Prince of Wales had a similar question tossed at him from the media pen on Tuesday, he declined to comment. That was wise and appropriate. The monarchy, like the country, was still digesting the Sussexes' remarks from the night before and the Queen had yet to release her statement.However \u2013 to coin a phrase \u2013 responses may vary. By yesterday, many people wanted to hear a member of the family say something. Indeed, they probably needed to hear from Prince William \u2013 the person torn in more directions than anyone in the current royal crisis.          RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Indecent exposure allegation that Sarah Everard murder...    'Harry wants America to HATE his own family': Piers Morgan...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n This was not a stage-managed intervention. Under lockdown rules, only a handful of media are permitted to attend royal engagements (they take turns according to a rota system \u2013 and not, as the Sussexes have claimed, by dint of some chummy cartel).Those who were allotted slots at yesterday's visit to an East London school had specifically been told that the duke would not be answering questions. They were also warned, rather primly, to remember that they were on school premises (where, presumably, no one ever misbehaves).Yet, one TV reporter decided that the world wanted an answer and raised his voice. The duke was happy to oblige.         This week, however, has been anything but normal. And the Duke of Cambridge is in a uniquely sad and painful positionPrince William also revealed the depth of the royal fault lines when he said that he had not spoken to his brother since the Oprah Winfrey interview. This was honest, not evasive.Needless to say, social media was soon ablaze. The usual ranks of the perpetually offended were thrilled to take fresh offence. 'How dare Prince William talk about racism!', shrieked the same people who had just been attacking the monarchy for not talking about racism.While they were rattling around in their echo chambers, however, the silent majority \u2013 that overwhelming and constant 75 per cent of the population who have always preferred a monarchy to a republic \u2013 will have seen yesterday's remarks for what they were: welcome words from a taciturn man understandably goaded beyond endurance.For, just as the wartime generation came to know and love a pair of very close, very different royal siblings \u2013 the quiet, serious Princess Elizabeth versus the wilder, cheeky Princess Margaret \u2013 so later generations would come to feel the same about William and Harry.It makes it all the more significant that the quiet, serious Duke of Cambridge spoke out in the way he did.These ostensibly casual remarks amount to an intervention reminiscent of the Queen's words outside Crathie Church in 2014. Shortly before the Scottish referendum, she told worshippers she 'hoped people would think very carefully about the future'. Yesterday was also a reminder of Prince William's coolness in a crisis. This week brings echoes of one of the most febrile situations I have witnessed in Britain in recent years.In the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster, all forms of authority were targets of visceral hostility. Both the Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had to be escorted off the premises. It was a highly volatile situation, stoked by a toxic racial dimension. Everyone was shaking fists.And then, all of a sudden, everything fell silent. I was standing outside the emergency rescue centre, underneath the A40 flyover, as the State Bentley pulled up unannounced.\u00a0Out stepped the Queen and the Duke of Cambridge. It was as if a switch had been flicked. The pair could offer no solutions, of course. But here was the sovereign and future sovereign, showing support and very visibly moved by it all.After meeting people inside the centre, they emerged. At which point, emotions started to crackle. 'What about the children? Queen?' yelled a man in the crowd, and kept on shouting. It was an ugly moment \u2013 until Prince William, ushering his grandmother in to the car, addressed the heckler. 'I'm sorry, I've got to go. I'll be back,' he shouted. 'I'll come back.' And he did.In years gone by, Palace staff had a phrase for a typical royal response in times of crisis: 'going ostrich'.\u00a0Judging by yesterday's firm but measured response from the Duke of Cambridge, no one is sticking their head in the sand this time.",

        "title": "How Gucci's Black Widow dressed to kill: Penthouses, yachts, Ferraris... she had it all. So why DID ex-wife of the fashion house's boss (played in a new film by Lady Gaga) have him gunned down by a pizza chef?",
        "full article": "That spring morning had broken clear and warm, and it was just after 8.30am when Maurizio Gucci, handsome scion of the famed fashion house, stepped out of his Milan apartment to make the short walk to his office on Via Palestro 20, just a stone\u2019s throw away from the city\u2019s fashion district.Clutching a handful of magazines and impeccably attired in a suit, tie and \u2014 what else? \u2014 Gucci loafers, he strode past the public gardens and headed up the short flight of steps on the way to his office.Unbeknown to him, however, another man had fallen in step behind him and, before Maurizio could head inside the building to commence another day\u2019s work at the helm of the Gucci empire, the gunman had pumped three shots into his back. As he collapsed on to the red marble floor, the coup de grace was delivered with a final shot to the head.This shocking act of savagery, in March 1995, soon became one of the most notorious murders in Italy\u2019s modern history, yet for two years investigators struggled to point the finger not only at the assassin, but at whoever had evidently hired him to commit the killing.         Incredibly, the person who had sought a contract killer to end Maurizio Gucci\u2019s life was the mother of his two children, Patrizia Reggiani (pictured). Unhappy at being paid only \u00a3900,000 a year in financial support after their bitter separation, and terrified at the prospect of him remarrying, Patrizia put a hit on her former husbandHad Maurizio run up one debt too many in an attempt to fund his increasingly luxurious lifestyle? Or had there been a fatal rupture within a family known for its bitter internal feuding? In the end, it was neither.Incredibly, the person who had sought a contract killer to end Maurizio Gucci\u2019s life was the mother of his two children, Patrizia Reggiani.Unhappy at being paid only \u00a3900,000 a year in financial support after their bitter separation, and terrified at the prospect of him remarrying, Patrizia put a hit on her former husband.This incredible story \u2014 a blend of high glamour, money and brutality \u2014 has now come into focus once more with the release yesterday of the first photo from the set of House Of Gucci \u2014 a dramatisation of the events leading up to Maurizio\u2019s murder.Directed by Ridley Scott, the British filmmaker of Gladiator fame, and featuring star turns by Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons, the film features Lady Gaga as the gaudily bejewelled Patrizia Reggiani, and Star Wars\u2019 Adam Driver playing her ill-fated husband, Maurizio.The tale has everything one would imagine of a design label synonymous with luxury, not to mention a villainess whose turn of phrase could give satirist Dorothy Parker a run for her money.         When Patrizia (pictured) was eventually found guilty of commissioning the hit on her husband, it was rumoured that Gucci stores throughout Italy symbolically hung sets of silver handcuffs in their windows       As Patrizia explained when asked by a reporter why she didn\u2019t undertake the hit herself: \u2018My eyesight is not so good. I didn\u2019t want to miss.\u2019Dubbed the Black Widow by the Italian press, Patrizia Reggiani\u2019s 1998 trial captivated and horrified the well-heeled denizens of Milan in equal measure.The Gucci brand, popularised by icons such as Elizabeth Taylor, Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren, suddenly found its name tainted with scandal.When Patrizia was eventually found guilty of commissioning the hit on her husband, it was rumoured that Gucci stores throughout Italy symbolically hung sets of silver handcuffs in their windows.Yet the love story between Patrizia and Maurizio had started, as they all do, so promisingly. They met at a party in Italy where Maurizio reportedly asked a friend, \u2018Who is that beautiful girl dressed in red who looks like Elizabeth Taylor?\u2019   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Bring back Piers Morgan: Groundswell of support for...    Riddle over 'flashing' incident: Watchdog probes Met as it...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n And as Patrizia claimed in a later interview, \u2018he fell madly in love with me. I was exciting and different.\u2019 Indeed, the two were very different. Maurizio was the grandson of Guccio Gucci \u2014 founder of the eponymous fashion house \u2014 while Patrizia came from rather more humble beginnings.Her mother Silvana had been a waitress who later married Ferdinando Reggiani \u2014 an older, wealthier man who had made his fortune in the haulage business.He subsequently adopted her daughter Patrizia and showered them both with gifts such as mink coats. Indeed, so quickly did Patrizia grow accustomed to the finer things in life that years later, when Maurizio embarked on his courtship and arrived at her doorstep in a small car, she considered him a \u2018loser\u2019.After agreeing to date him, she insisted he buy her a Ferrari.Unsurprisingly perhaps, the Gucci family were initially sceptical of Maurizio\u2019s new love.After his mother died when he was just five years old, his father Rodolfo, formerly an actor in Italy, ran the Gucci company with his older brother Aldo (Maurizio\u2019s uncle), and was so concerned that Patrizia was marrying his only son for his money that he cut off Maurizio\u2019s funding and entreated the Cardinal of Milan to call a halt to their planned wedding. But to no avail.         Directed by Ridley Scott, the British filmmaker of Gladiator fame, and featuring star turns by Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons, the film features Lady Gaga (right) as the gaudily bejewelled Patrizia Reggiani, and Star Wars\u2019 Adam Driver (left) playing her ill-fated husband, Maurizio       Maurizio and Patrizia married in 1972 when both were around 24 and subsequently had two daughters \u2014 Alessandra and Allegra.For a decade at least, the couple were happy and even Rodolfo (played in the movie by Jeremy Irons, with Al Pacino playing his brother Aldo) softened his stance after the birth of his grandchildren, buying the family several properties, including a luxury penthouse in New York\u2019s Olympic Tower.The city became a favoured stomping ground as the Guccis socialised with Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the Kennedy kids, and tootled around Manhattan in a car complete with their number plate \u2018Mauizia\u2019.There were lavish parties, totally befitting the excesses of the Eighties, and trips to private islands on their yacht, The Creole. There was also a home in Acapulco and a ski chalet in St. Moritz, whose surroundings, one imagines, were not dissimilar to those in the new image featuring Lady Gaga and Adam Driver.But then things started to sour. In 1983, Rodolfo died, and as Maurizio took control of the family business, it soon began to flounder.This, according to Patrizia, was due to the fact that he \u2018stopped listening to me\u2019 and lacked any kind of original thinking. Or as she more colourfully put it: \u2018My husband was like a pillow \u2014 he carried the imprint of the last one who sat on it.\u2019         Maurizio was the grandson of Guccio Gucci \u2014 founder of the eponymous fashion house \u2014 while Patrizia came from rather more humble beginningsPerhaps sensing a lack of support on the part of his wife, in May 1985 Maurizio packed his bags for a business trip to Florence and never returned.But if her doubts about her husband\u2019s business acumen eventually proved correct (in 1993 he sold his holding in Gucci to a Bahrain-based investment company for $170 million), worse was to come.Though they had divorced in 1991, Patrizia continued to refer to him as \u2018my husband\u2019 and after dismissing a settlement of \u00a32.5 million plus \u00a3650,000 per year as \u2018a mere bowl of lentils\u2019, she ended up with \u00a3900,000 a year in financial support.Most worrying for Patrizia, however, was the fact that Maurizio was due to marry Paola Franchi, a younger, glamorous blonde.As subsequently emerged during the trial, Patrizia feared if Maurizio remarried, the power, money and status she had acquired would disappear and that should the couple have children, her daughters\u2019 inheritance would disappear, too. Something had to be done.That something, it later emerged, came in the shape of Benedetto Ceraulo, a debt-ridden pizzeria owner, who wanted the six-figure price that had now been put on Maurizio Gucci\u2019s head.         Though they had divorced in 1991, Patrizia continued to refer to him as \u2018my husband\u2019 and after dismissing a settlement of \u00a32.5 million plus \u00a3650,000 per year as \u2018a mere bowl of lentils\u2019, she ended up with \u00a3900,000 a year in financial support       Despite the fact he was hardly a criminal mastermind, the authorities struggled to piece the clues together. Investigations initially focused on Maurizio\u2019s many business enemies and irregularities in his own dealings.He had run up many debts thanks to his extravagant lifestyle, and had even been accused by his own family of faking his father\u2019s signature in order to acquire the Gucci fortune.But his lover Paola continued to suspect Patrizia had a hand in his murder, and after receiving an anonymous tip some two years after the murder, police were finally forced to follow that lead.As it turned out, Patrizia hadn\u2019t sufficiently covered the tracks of her ire towards her ex-husband.On the day her husband was gunned down she had written the word Paradeisos (Greek for Paradise) in her Cartier diary.In the documentary Lady Gucci: The Story Of Patrizia Reggiani broadcast this year, she admitted, \u2018I was furious with Maurizio [after the divorce]. I went around asking everyone, even the local grocer: \u201cIs there someone who has the courage to murder my husband?\u201d\u2019In the end it wasn\u2019t the grocer but the pizza guy who helped her carry out the plan. When the case went to trial in 1998, conflicting stories began to emerge.A longstanding friend of Patrizia, Pina Auriemma \u2014 a high society psychic, no less \u2014 who had been struggling with debts herself, claimed that \u2018in a moment of weakness\u2019 she gave in to her friend\u2019s requests to find a hitman.For her part, Patrizia, who showed up at the trial swathed head-to-toe in Gucci clothing and accessories, claimed Pina hired the hitman without her authorisation and had then blackmailed her after the murder had taken place.Yet Pina the psychic failed to foresee what was coming: she was sentenced to 25 years for her part in organising the crime.Benedetto the hitman was given a life sentence and the getaway driver and a night porter also involved in the murder were sentenced to 29 and 26 years in prison respectively.As for Patrizia, she was handed a 29-year sentence, despite her lawyers arguing she would have been unable to plot such a crime on account of an operation she had in 1992 for a brain tumour.Paradoxically though, she confessed, \u2018I didn\u2019t think they would have caught me.\u2019Patrizia spent her time in Milan\u2019s San Vittore Prison sleeping \u2018a lot\u2019 and taking care of her plants.She was even allowed to care for her pet ferret Bambi there \u2014 a special privilege negotiated by her lawyers \u2014 although Bambi was to suffer an unfortunate demise when a fellow inmate accidentally sat on him.In 2011, Patrizia turned down the opportunity of being moved to an open prison where inmates were expected to work, saying: \u2018I\u2019ve never worked in my life and I\u2019m certainly not going to start now.\u2019While her sentence was reduced to 26 years on appeal, she ended up serving just 16 years until her eventual release in October 2014.After her release she continued to court attention by strolling around Milan with a pet parrot on her shoulder. A court ruled she was still entitled to the \u00a3900,000 a year from her murdered ex-husband\u2019s estate, and awarded her \u00a316 million to cover her time in prison.She once opined: \u2018I\u2019d rather cry in a Rolls than be happy on a bicycle.\u2019Now 72, she shares her home with her parrot and dog and, while suitors have come and gone, she astonishingly claims the man she ordered killed was her \u2018only true love\u2019. Her daughters Alessandra, 44, and Allegra, 40, who were last believed to live in Switzerland, have little to do with her.Having lived a life as colourful as any Gucci print shirt, one would imagine Patrizia is thrilled at having the flamboyant Lady Gaga portray her on screen.Yet when asked on the Italian TV show Storie Italiane how she felt about the movie, her reply was uncharacteristically circumspect.\u2018I have two daughters,\u2019 she replied with some dismay.\u2018I don\u2019t like that they relive their father\u2019s situation.\u2019Whether they like it or not, the extraordinary story of their mother\u2019s monstrous jealousy is about to become infamous all over again.\u00a0House Of Gucci will be released later this year.",

        "title": "World stock markets hit two-week high as inflation worries abate",
        "full article": "By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets climbed for a third straight session on Thursday to hit its highest level in two weeks, as a dip in government bond yields helped curb inflation concerns and give a boost to equities. Euro zone bond yields fell after the European Central Bank said it was ready to accelerate money-printing to keep a lid on euro zone borrowing costs, using its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) more generously over the coming months to stop any unwarranted rise in debt financing costs. Germany's 10-year government bond yield was last at -0.333%, after falling as far as -0.367%, the lowest level since Feb. 18 and further away from the near one-year high of -0.203% in late February. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.475%, the first time it had dipped below 1.5% in a week. It last fell 2/32 in price to yield 1.5266%, from 1.52% late on Wednesday. On Wall Street, the easing inflation worry helped support equities, with the highly valued technology sector leading the way higher, up 2.12%. Expensive stocks, many of which are in the tech sector, have been highly sensitive to the rise in yields. In contrast, shares of bank stocks lost 0.47%. Still, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs, the tech-heavy Nasdaq paced the gains, rising more than 2% on the day. \"A lot of it depends on rates, a lot of it depends on that initial prick that started that transition from large cap tech to the rest of the market and small caps,\" said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. \"If rates continue to trend higher that trend will continue, if rates kind of stall out like they have over the next couple of days then we could have a back and forth that hopefully isn\u00b4t as volatile as it has been the last couple of days, but we should expect there is going to be a lot of action.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 188.57 points, or 0.58%, to 32,485.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 40.46 points, or 1.04%, to 3,939.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 329.84 points, or 2.52%, to 13,398.67. Sentiment was also boosted by weekly jobless claims data, which pointed to a recovering U.S. labor market as vaccine rollouts have helped lead to economic reopenings. European stocks climbed, with the pan-European STOXX 600 higher for a fourth straight day, its longest winning streak in five weeks, with the index closing at its highest level since Feb. 21, 2020. The STOXX 600 index rose 0.49% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.37%. An auction of 30-year U.S. debt on Thursday was viewed as slightly weak, but nowhere near the disappointing seven-year auction in late February that helped fuel inflation concerns and sent yields higher. Analysts largely expect inflation to pick up as vaccine rollouts lead to a reopening of the economy, but worries persist that additional stimulus in the form of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package set to be signed by U.S. President Joe Biden could overheat the economy. The dollar was weaker for a third straight day coming off a 3-1/2-month high of 92.506 on Tuesday. The dollar index fell 0.48%, with the euro up 0.52% to $1.1987. Oil prices resumed their climb following two days of declines, buoyed by the brightening economic outlook and a decline in the dollar. U.S. crude settled up 2.5% at $66.02 per barrel and Brent was at $69.63, up 2.6% on the day.

        "full article": "Maryland lost decisively to Michigan twice during the regular season. The Terrapins will get another shot at the Wolverines in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament in Indianapolis on Friday. The eighth-seeded Terrapins (16-12) advanced with a 68-57 victory over ninth seed Michigan State on Thursday. Michigan, the Big Ten's regular-season champion, recorded an 84-73 win at Maryland's home court on New Year's Eve, then blew out the Terrapins 87-63 at Ann Arbor, Mich., on Jan. 19. In the first meeting, Wolverines center Hunter Dickinson dominated in the lane with 26 points and 11 rebounds. In the rematch, Michigan knocked down half of its 24 3-point attempts. \"They've just whipped us both times,\" Maryland coach Mark Turgeon said during a Big Ten Network interview. \"We've got to just try to play better against them. Their size is just amazing across the board. You double the post, they can make threes. You don't double the post, those guys can score on you. It's a tough one for us.\" The Terrapins put themselves in a tough spot entering the conference tournament, losing their final two regular-season contests. The win over the Spartans helped their NCAA Tournament prospects. Maryland got off to a slow start, trailing by 12 midway through the first half. From that point, the Terrapins shut down the Spartans' attack. They forced 18 turnovers, leading to 27 points. \"We played for 40 minutes,\" Turgeon said. \"They came out hot. They had 19 (points) at the second media timeout, which wasn't us. After that, we were really good defensively.\" The duo of Eric Ayala and Aaron Wiggins combined for 40 points, 15 rebounds, six assists and five steals. \"We wanted to come into the game with positive energy,\" Ayala said. \"Coach has been talking about it all year, just playing with positive attitudes.\" The Terrapins led by as much as 19 against Michigan State, which defeated Michigan on Sunday. \"We shared the ball better,\" Turgeon said. \"We moved our bodies better. We just played with great toughness and we weren't going to be denied today.\" The fourth-ranked Wolverines (19-3) lost two of their final three regular-season games after ranking as high as No. 2. Their bigger concern is the health of starting guard Eli Brooks, who suffered a left ankle sprain in the early going on Sunday. His status for this week's tournament is uncertain, although the Wolverines seem resigned to playing without him for at least Friday's game. He was still wearing a walking boot as of Wednesday. \"Eli is such an important player for us, offensively and defensively. (He and Franz Wagner) are probably our best defenders on the team,\" Dickinson said. \"When we don't have him, it's obviously a lot tougher to win. Like Coach (Juwan Howard) always says, it's a next-man-up approach and we're going to miss him a lot.\" Brooks averages 8.7 points per game -- tied with Mike Smith for fourth on the team -- but his contributions go far beyond that, assistant coach Phil Martelli said in a radio interview. \"He's the most valuable player on this team, plain and simple,\" he said. \"The most invaluable piece, both to his teammates and to the coaching staff, is Eli Brooks. We talked about what this team is about. It's about balance and that's what Eli brings.\" --Field Level Media",

        "title": "Sacklers boost opioid settlement offer to $4.3 billion -sources",
        "full article": "By Mike Spector NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP have offered roughly $4.3 billion to resolve sprawling opioid litigation, up from $3 billion initially proposed in settlement discussions underway in the OxyContin maker's bankruptcy proceedings, four people familiar with the matter said. Sackler family members are now willing to contribute $4.275 billion to help settle about 3,000 lawsuits brought by U.S. communities seeking to hold them and Purdue responsible for damage wrought by the opioid epidemic, the sources said. Purdue and representatives for the Sacklers declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests. Details of a far-reaching settlement could be outlined in a Purdue reorganization plan filed in a U.S. bankruptcy court next week. Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 facing on onslaught of opioid litigation. In November, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company pleaded guilty to three felonies arising from its marketing of prescription opioid painkillers. A previous proposed settlement that Purdue values at more than $10 billion guaranteed $3 billion from the Sacklers over seven years, with additional funds from family members contingent on sales of other international businesses they own. That offer as a practical matter decreased to $2.775 billion after the Sacklers agreed to pay $225 million to settle a Justice Department civil probe. Under terms of the latest proposal, the Sacklers could still use proceeds from sales of those businesses to cover the higher $4.275 billion payout, but would need to make good on it regardless. It is not clear how long the Sacklers would take to pay the proposed higher amount, but it would likely be a period of years, the sources said. ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS Settlement negotiations are ongoing and no final agreement, including on how much the Sacklers will pay, has yet been reached among the family members, Purdue and U.S. communities suing over the opioid crisis. Elsewhere in the settlement negotiations, some litigants have been pushing for Purdue to explore a sale in lieu of a current proposal to dissolve itself and shift assets to a public benefit company or similar entity run on behalf of plaintiffs and no longer controlled by the Sacklers, two people familiar with the matter said. Attorneys general from two dozen states and Washington, D.C., have opposed that plan because the new entity would continue selling OxyContin, which they view as improperly entangling them with the addictive painkiller. Purdue in November admitted to defrauding U.S. officials and paying illegal kickbacks to both doctors and an electronic healthcare records vendor, part of widespread criminal misconduct that facilitated improper opioid prescriptions. The company overall agreed to $8.3 billion in criminal in civil penalties to resolve U.S. Justice Department probes, most of which will go unpaid. A $3.54 billion criminal penalty and $2.8 billion civil penalty are set to be considered alongside trillions of dollars in unsecured claims as part of Purdue's bankruptcy proceedings. Purdue agreed to pay $225 million toward a $2 billion criminal forfeiture, with the Justice Department foregoing the rest if the company's bankruptcy reorganization creates a public benefit company or similar entity steering the remaining $1.775 billion to U.S. communities for combating the opioid crisis. Sackler family members have not been criminally charged. They agreed to pay $225 million to resolve allegations they caused false claims for OxyContin to be made to government healthcare programs such as Medicare. They have denied the allegations. The opioid epidemic has claimed the lives of roughly 450,000 people across the United States since 1999 due to overdoses from prescription painkillers and illegal drugs such as heroin and fentanyl, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Purdue's bankruptcy filing halted litigation against the company and its Sackler family owners. Since then, the company has been working toward proposing a reorganization plan that would serve as blueprint for settling the thousands of outstanding lawsuits. Purdue's proposal to resolve cases in a deal it values at more than $10 billion is largely contingent on future donations of overdose reversal and addiction treatment medications the company has under development. How much the Sacklers will contribute has long been a key sticking point in negotiations among family members, Purdue and plaintiffs. Many states rejected their initial $3 billion offer as too low. In December, two Sackler family members offered apologies when testifying before a congressional panel over the role OxyContin played in the opioid crisis. The family members, both of whom previously served on Purdue\u00b4s board, insisted they were assured by management that the company was meeting regulatory and legal requirements as the opioid crisis unfolded.

In a way, reverse dieting is progressively overloading your meals with calories and nutrients, as opposed to sudden jumps in energy intake.\u00a0While reverse dieting can be applied in a variety of scenarios, the first example that comes to mind is gradually increasing calorie intake after being in a prominent deficit - for example, following a bodybuilding comp prep, or simply after a prolonged fat loss phase.\u00a0You may notice some weight gain in the process, even if you\u2019ve applied a slight increase while definitely staying in a calorie deficit. Don\u2019t panic - it\u2019s highly unlikely to be fat! Extra food causes a little bit of fluid retention, which is temporary, normal, and will self-resolve over time.Source: Bodies By Rachel\u00a0Advertisement\nShe said the slow approach works best for those struggling mentally with the idea of weight regain - or those who have been on a low or 'aggressive' calorie weight-loss eating plan.To jump straight back to new maintenance, Sophie said dieters would have 'more flexibility to eat out and enjoy non-dieting life' and will notice an energy increase, better sleep and mood.\u00a0\u00a0Sophie explained that you need to listen to your body and understand how\u00a0efficient, or inefficient your metabolism is, how long you've dieted for, how frequent or aggressive before choosing an approach.'My advice would be to add 100 to 200 calories every two weeks to begin with, then make changes weekly, and slow it down as your calories get higher,' she said.\u00a0'It may seem like a lot, but you'll honestly burn that amount just with daily movement and a higher TEF (thermic effect of food) you'll get from eating and digesting more food.'She suggested keeping track of how you progress, how quickly you regain weight, and make\u00a0slow, deliberate changes as you go. What are Sophie's top tips for lasting fat loss?\u00a0  1. Eat less than you burn in a day.         Sophie (pictured) shared the tips online.

        "full article": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - A measure to renew billions of dollars in emergency aid for millions of Brazilians struggling amid the COVID-19 pandemic passed in the lower house of Congress on Thursday, though lawmakers were still working on the details. The bill, already approved by the Senate, allows for a maximum spending of 44 billion reais - $7.9 billion - though the initial measure did not specify how much families would receive, or for how long. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes earlier said it should be between $175-$375, for up to four months. A similar cash transfer program last year totaling 330 billion reais helped nearly 70 million Brazilians, nearly a third of the population, and was widely credited with helping to avoid an even worse economic crash. But it was discontinued on Dec. 31. In Rio de Janeiro\u00b4s long-derelict port neighborhood, 34 year-old Tassiana Nascimento Costa said last year\u00b4s emergency fund had enabled her to feed her two children and that life had become a lot more difficult since it was discontinued. Costa, who usually makes a living selling bottled water and other drinks in the streets, said her income fell from about 200 reais a day to just 50 or 70 reais. And with the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases and deaths, she\u00b4s afraid of catching the virus and is no longer working, relying solely on a family allowance, a separate government aid program. If the amounts cited by Guedes are approved, the pandemid aid would bring her an additional $18 each month. \"As I can\u00b4t work at the moment, this helps,\" Costa said. \"But it won\u00b4t change my situation much.\"          Residents sit as they eat food donated by aid groups at an occupied building amid the new coronavirus pandemic, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Wednesday, March 10, 2021.

(AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo)  Last year\u00b4s program boosted Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\u00b4s popularity, and his ratings have dropped since it came to an end. It also helped stave off an even deeper recession in Latin America\u00b4s largest nation. Brazil\u00b4s economy contracted 4.1% last year, less than the 5.3% plunge forecast by the International Monetary Fund in April 2020. Brazil is passing through its worst moment of the pandemic. The number of new COVID-19 cases is still surging, with a new record high 2,286 deaths reported on Wednesday. New measures aimed at limiting activity, or the strengthening of existing ones in some Brazilian states, could also add financial pressure to Brazil's poorest.",

        "title": "Weekend Preview: Phoenix Raceway",
        "full article": "This is an important weekend on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule as teams compete Sunday in the Instacart 500 at Phoenix Raceway (3:30 p.m. ET on FOX, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio) - the 50th race at the recently-renovated venue that will host Championship Weekend in November. Not only is there a trophy to win, but teams will use the race to help prepare for the title-stop later in the season. Joe Gibbs Racing driver Denny Hamlin arrives in Phoenix leading the driver standings by 38 points over Team Penske's Brad Keselowski. However, neither driver has hoisted a trophy yet this season. Four different drivers - Michael McDowell (Daytona 500), Christopher Bell (Daytona road course), William Byron (Homestead-Miami) and last weekend's winner, Kyle Larson (Las Vegas) - have won a race to start the season and secured a position in the June 13 NASCAR All-Star Race at Texas Motor Speedway. Plus, they have locked themselves into the playoffs. Should a fifth different driver win this weekend it would mark the first time since 2017 that a season has opened with five different winners. The record is 10 different winners - launching the 2000 schedule. Only one of these 2021 winners - Byron - made the 2020 playoffs. That leaves the more typical headline-makers such as Hamlin, an eight-time winner in 2020 and the 2012 season champion, and Keselowski, a four-race winner last year, still vying for their first trip to Victory Lane. Count 2020 NASCAR Cup Series champion Chase Elliott and perennial title-chasers Kevin Harvick, Joey Logano and Kyle Busch among those still driving for a victory in 2021 as well. Team Penske's Joey Logano is the defending race winner of this week's Phoenix event, which marked the last regularly scheduled race to run in 2020 before the sport took a time-out for COVID-19. Harvick, the driver of the No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, owns a stellar record at Phoenix with a series-leading nine victories -- 18 top 5s and 25 top 10s in 36 starts. He leads the series in pre-race driver rating (110.6) at Phoenix and has the best average finish (8.917) as well. A win this weekend would make him one of only six drivers in NASCAR Cup Series history to earn a double-digit victory total at a track, an esteemed list that includes Richard Petty, Darrell Waltrip, Jimmie Johnson, David Pearson and Dale Earnhardt. Harvick started the year with three top-10 finishes but suffered a 20th-place showing last week at Las Vegas. The last time he finished outside the top-10 in Phoenix was 2013 - 16 races ago. He was runner-up to Logano last March and finished seventh in November. His last win at the 1-mile track was spring 2018. With a $178 million facility renovation at Phoenix - from track surface and configuration to grandstands and parking - Harvick is eager to restore his winning ways. \"Our Jimmy John's team won several races on this configuration,\" said Harvick, who is ranked seventh in the Cup standings. \"It's still the same racetrack that we've won the majority of our races on. The only thing that's changed is the start-finish line. As you look at last year, we ran really well at the first race and really poorly at the second race. \"A lot of that just depends on where the grip level is and where your car settings are for that particular weekend. But it's still a racetrack where we expect to go and contend for a win every time and, if we don't, the expectations were not met.\" Hamlin, the points leader, has four top-5 finishes in the last six Phoenix races, including one of his two career wins there (2019 playoffs). The driver of the No. 11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota was 20th in this spring race last year and fourth in the season finale. Twice (2010, 2017) he's led more than 190 laps but didn't win the race. Keselowski, driver of the No. 2 Team Penske Ford, is racing for his first win at Phoenix. He has a pair of runner-up finishes in the last five events, including the Championship Finale last November. Elliott, who claimed his first NASCAR Cup Series title with a win at Phoenix last November, has only one top-10 finish in 2021 - a runner-up in the Daytona 500 - even though he's led laps in all four races. Elliott has six top-10 finishes in 10 Phoenix starts and in the two races last year led 246 of the 402 scheduled laps. \"I am definitely looking forward to getting back to Phoenix this weekend,\" Elliott said. \"Our last trip there was something I will never forget. Obviously, it's a new season, eyes forward for now and just thinking about what we need to do to be fast and have our car where it needs to be. \"I also hope we can learn a lot while we are there because you want to be prepared if you are in the Championship 4 at the end of the season.\" XFINITY SERIES KEEPS PRODUCING DIFFERENT WINNERS There have been four different winners in as many NASCAR Xfinity Series races this season and plenty reason to expect a fifth in Saturday's Call 811 Before You Dig 200 presented by Arizona 811 (5:30 p.m. ET on FS1, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Championship leader Austin Cindric, who won the season-opening race at Daytona International Speedway, arrives at the one-mile Phoenix Raceway as the most recent race winner. His victory there last November earned the 22-year-old his first NASCAR championship and has by all accounts, helped put Cindric on a high-octane performance course in 2021. He is the only driver to earn top-5 finishes in every race this season and his 163 laps led is nearly double that of any other driver. Last week's Las Vegas race winner, A.J. Allmendinger, is second with 93 laps out front. Both Cindric and Allmendinger are well aware that their stiffest competition this weekend may well come from 24-year-old Joe Gibbs Racing driver Brandon Jones, who is ranked third in the Xfinity Series championship standings. The driver of the No. 19 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota is the defending winner of the Phoenix spring race, finished third in the season finale race. And Jones has finished top 10 in four of his last five starts on the desert oval. His 3.556-second win over Harrison Burton last March was the largest margin of victory in nine Xfinity Series races at Phoenix - since Kyle Busch dominated the race by more than six seconds in November 2016. \"Our 19 Toyota team is thrilled to be heading back to Phoenix,\" Jones said. \"We had a pivotal win there last spring when we won against our teammate Kyle Busch. You take that strong win and mix it with us coming off our third consecutive top-four finish in the past three races. This momentum gives us the confidence to build on and focus on winning at Phoenix Raceway. \"As we look at data and notes from last year, I have already picked up on several areas where I can improve. This is an important weekend for our team to learn as much as possible; with Phoenix being the track that will hold the title to the Xfinity Series Championship later this year.\" They will undoubtedly face a challenge from series veteran and JR Motorsports driver Justin Allgaier, a two-time Phoenix race winner - the only current full time Xfinity Series driver with multiple wins (2017, 2020) at the 1-mile track. His 461 laps led at Phoenix is most among series regulars and he's scored top-10 finishes in nine of the last 13 races. Another Joe Gibbs Racing driver, Daniel Hemric, shows up in Phoenix extremely motivated. He finished runner-up to Allmendinger at Las Vegas last weekend - the eighth second-place finish in the series for the well-liked North Carolinian. He has three top-5 finishes in four races this year and his effort last week will put him in pole position this week at Phoenix, where he has a pair of top-5 finishes in six Xfinity Series starts, including a runner-up in fall 2018. This weekend marks the second NASCAR Xfinity Series start for 18-year-old Ty Gibbs, grandson to NASCAR Hall of Famer Joe Gibbs, who showed some serious competitive mettle by winning at the Daytona Road Course in February - his series debut in the No. 54 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota. Gibbs has an ARCA Menards Series West victory at in three Phoenix starts. If Gibbs were to win in his first two consecutive races he would become the first driver in NASCAR Xfinity Series history to accomplish the feat. The rookie's veteran team has every expectation for another solid outing. \"The No. 54 team is excited to go back to the racetrack with Ty Gibbs in Phoenix,\" said team crew chief Chris Gayle. \"Ty did such an exceptional job at the Daytona Road Course of being cautious and learning as a rookie driver, mixed with being very aggressive late in the race when he was in position to win the event. He's really good at Phoenix and we're looking forward to helping him progress and learn more at his first oval event for this team.\" Other drivers deserving a watch this week include 22-year-old JR Motorsports driver Noah Gragson, who had a rough start to the 2021 season but rebounded last week with a fifth-place finish at his home track in Las Vegas - his first top 5 of the year. Gragson has never finished worse than 11th in four Phoenix starts with results of seventh in this race last year and runner-up in the November finale. Jeb Burton, who is competing in his first full-time season with Kaulig Motorsports, has been ranked among the top-five in the standings all season. The 28-year-old son of former Daytona 500 winner Ward Burton has finished top-10 in every race this year with best showings of fourth place at the Daytona International Speedway season-opener and at Homestead-Miami Speedway in South Florida two weeks ago. He finished 17th in his only Xfinity Series start at Phoenix back in 2016.

        "title": "Zion National Park search for woman cost $60K, report says",
        "full article": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A search for a California woman who was missing for two weeks last fall at Zion National Park in Utah before being found alive cost about $60,000, park officials said Thursday. The cost estimate was provided by park officials who also released investigative reports revealing the search was about to be scaled back the morning that Holly Suzanne Courtier of Los Angeles was found in a hammock near a trail thanks to a tip from someone who saw her there, the report said. Heavily redacted reports don't say what happened to Courtier or why it was so difficult to find her in a park that is relatively small compared to other sprawling national parks. During the search, the park and the nearby town of Springdale were filled with missing person signs featuring pictures of Courtier and the clothes she was wearing in a case that generated national interest. After park rangers found Courtier on Oct. 18, 2020, she walked about 1,000 feet (305 meters) to a nearby road and was taken to a park building where she agreed to be interviewed by rangers. What she told them, however, is redacted in the report. \"In this case, the harm to personal privacy is greater than whatever public interest may be served by disclosure and would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\" Zion officials said in a statement. Her family and park officials had feared the worst. The park is known for its towering red rock cliffs and hikes that take people along narrow trails with steep drops nearby. After Courtier was found, the family thanked park officials in a statement but said nothing else publicly. Courtier\u00b4s daughter, Kailey Chambers, told CNN in October after that her mother hurt her head early in her hike and became disoriented. Crews began searching for Courtier after she didn\u00b4t show up for her scheduled pickup in the park by a private shuttle on Oct. 6, authorities said. The daily searches included dozens of rangers, search dogs, drones and helicopters. Courtier's family was at the southern Utah park after she went missing and started their own daily organized searches on Oct. 14, the report said. Park officials gave the family daily updates and shared drone footage, but kept their searches separate from those conducted by volunteers because they didn't want to accept liability for the volunteers, the report said. On the morning she was found, a Zion official leading search efforts informed the team that the operations would be scaled back to halt doing daily trail searches and respond only to tips. \"In the absence of any clues it was no longer practical to put people in areas or on trails with no foreseeable end,\" said the unnamed official, according to the repot. A short time later, a tip was received that led to Courtier's discovery. Someone reported seeing what appeared to be a person in a hammock near a trail the night before around sunset. Search teams went to the location and found her lying the hammock, the report said. The costs of the search included thousands of dollars spent on search supplies such as GPS devices and thermal monoculars. It also includes thousands of dollars spent on food and snacks for search teams, the report shows. The National Park Service doesn't charge visitors for the cost of search and rescue efforts, which are done to keep visitors safe, said park spokeswoman Amanda Rowland. More than 4 million people visited Zion each of the four years prior to 2020 when temporary closures due to the pandemic dropped the figure to about 3.6 million, park figures show.",

The 60-year-old man was charged on Thursday by detectives from the fraud and extortion squad with five counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception. He has been summonsed to appear at Melbourne Magistrates Court on March 26. Detectives on Friday said the charges related to finance that was allegedly fraudulently obtained between April and July 2019, when the man was employed at a Melbourne-based property company. They allege the finance was purported to be for the purchase of Melbourne apartment buildings and their planned lease.",

        "title": "Kentucky NCAA hopes end after being bounced from SEC tourney",
        "full article": "Kentucky's season ended with a missed last-second shot in the SEC Tournament. But things began spiraling downward for the Wildcats long before Thursday's disappointing 74-73 setback against Mississippi State that sealed their fate: No NCAA Tournament this year. When the Bulldogs' Iverson Molinar made two free throws with seven seconds left, it assured the Wildcats (9-16) will miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2013 and just the second in John Calipari's 12-year tenure in Lexington. With Duke withdrawing from the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament due to a positive COVID test, it will be the first time since 1976 that both the Blue Devils and Kentucky will not be in the NCAAs. Digesting the reality and enduring a losing season at college basketball's winningest program will make for a long offseason for the Wildcats. \"I've never lost this many games in my life in basketball consecutively like this,\" graduate guard Davion Mintz said. \"I know other guys on this roster haven't, either. But now you know how it feels. You don't want to climb back into that hole. You don't want that pain to come back.\"          Kentucky players leave the court after losing to Mississippi State in an NCAA college basketball game in the Southeastern Conference Tournament Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)  Kentucky dug that deep hole in the season\u00b4s first month, and it became harder to climb out of as the losses piled up. The Wildcats were able to string together a couple of three-game winning streaks, but still finished the season seven games under .500 in the pandemic-shortened season. Those spurts merely halted slides of six and four games, respectively, which meant the blue-blood program needed to mount its longest winning steak of the season and win the SEC Tournament to extend the season. \"We were a couple of wins away from being a team, even with a bad record, we were right there,\" Calipari said of Kentucky's NCAA prospects. \"But at the end of the day, you've gotta win games and you've gotta be tough and you've got to play winning basketball. ... We were never able to get fully engaged in that.\" The last time Kentucky was out of the Big Dance was in 2013 after going 21-12 - then was promptly bounced from the NIT by Robert Morris in the first round. Don't look for the Wildcats in any postseason tourney this year. It's the program\u00b4s first losing campaign since going 13-19 in 1988-89, one that approached historic proportions as Kentucky\u00b4s worst since the 1926-27 squad began 1-8 on the way to a 3-13 ending. An opening-game rout of neighboring Morehead State - which went on to win the Ohio Valley Conference Tournament for an automatic NCAA bid - was followed by a six-game losing streak that included a loss to rival Louisville. The Wildcats rebounded to win their first three SEC games, only to seesaw between a four-game skid and three-game winning streak. Developing chemistry took time for a team that returned just sophomore forward Keion Brooks Jr. and welcomed 10 new faces. Like many teams, the Wildcats had little practice or free time together because of pandemic restrictions. Injuries that sidelined Brooks the first nine games and Terrence Clarke for more than two months until Thursday didn't help either, leaving the Wildcats vulnerable in the post. One of the main issues for the Wildcats was putting up points, as Kentucky ranked 200th in Division I in scoring. The offense began showing some promise in mid-February, though not consistent enough to get the wins needed to get close to .500 and merit postseason consideration. The inconsistent play that led to many ebbs and flows also raised questions about the talent level of the consensus No. 1 ranked recruiting class, along with the Hall of Famer\u00b4s one-and-done model. His coaching methods and rotations also came under fire. It's unclear which Wildcats freshmen will enter the NBA draft. The most likely candidate is freshman forward Isaiah Jackson, who blossomed into a formidable rim protector before recently revealing his offensive skills. He\u00b4s projected as a lottery pick despite fouling out with just seven points and three rebounds in 19 minutes against MSU. Guard Brandon Boston Jr. battled offensive consistency all season but is rated as a first-round selection on several draft sites. Mintz and Wake Forest transfer Olivier Sarr - are likely gone as seniors, though both could return if the NCAA grants an extra season of eligibility because of the pandemic that created pauses for many programs. Whatever happens, Kentucky has work to do to bounce back from this low point in program history. \"I'm disappointed in the record, but not disappointed in these kids,\" Calipari said, being careful not to look too far ahead. \"We weren't what we thought we could be in different spots, but we'll address that when this winds down.\" ____ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/College-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25          Kentucky fans watch the final moments of the second half of a loss to Mississippi State in an NCAA college basketball game in the Southeastern Conference Tournament Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Nashville, Tenn.

        "full article": "Judge Peter Hall, the Vermont judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, died Thursday at the Rutland Regional Medical Center. He was 72. Hall\u00b4s judicial assistant Rose Rizzico, who confirmed his death, said he had been suffering from cancer. Hall was appointed to the seat on the New York appeals court, which hears cases from New York, Connecticut and Vermont, in 2004 by former President George W. Bush. Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston said that, during his years on the court, Hall distinguished himself as a thoughtful and humane jurist who was generous and considerate with his colleagues. \"Judge Hall was committed to public service and taught us all by his example,\" Livingston said in a statement. \"He was a kind and very dear friend. This is a sad day for the judges of the Court of Appeals.\" Hall announced last week that he was taking senior status, the term used for a judge deciding to take a reduced workload.

Hall, on the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, died Thursday, March 11, at the Rutland Regional Medical Center in Rutland, Vt. He was 72. (Hazel Brewster/Vermont Lieutenant Governor's Office, via AP)  His last public appearance came last month, when he traveled to Montpelier to swear in Vermont Lt. Gov. Molly Gray, who had clerked for him in 2014 and 2015. \"He has worked tirelessly and with great humility and integrity, on the bench in New York and in his Chambers in Rutland, Vermont to offer his voice, Vermont\u00b4s voice, in the Court\u00b4s pursuit of justice,\" Gray said in a statement when Hall took senior status. Vermont U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy said Hall was a good friend. \"Vermont and the country are richer for his many years of service,\" Leahy said in a statement. Hall was born in Connecticut in 1948 and moved to Vermont at age 11. A tribute to Hall from the appeals court said that Hall's great-great-grandfather served as governor of Vermont and he always considered himself a native Vermonter. Hall graduated from Cornell Law in 1977 and went on to serve as a law clerk to Vermont's late U.S. District Court Judge Albert Coffrin. He also served as Vermont's U.S. attorney. After he joined the appeals court, Hall said he enjoyed spending one week a month in New York and then working the rest of the time in Vermont. \"He loved being in New York with the judges,\" said Rizzico. Hall is survived by his wife Maria Dunton, five children and five grandchildren.

        "full article": "Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos says there is still no news on his future as he approaches the end of his contract with the Spanish giants. The 34-year-old Spain defender will see his current deal expire in June, and as yet there has been no official word on any extension. Ramos has not played since suffering a knee injury in the Spanish Super Cup defeat by Athletic Bilbao on January 14.  Following a minor surgical procedure, Ramos has been back in training with the Madrid squad and could be involved again for the Champions League last-16 tie against Atalanta. The veteran centre-back has been linked with a move to both Manchester United and Tottenham, now managed by former Real boss Jose Mourinho. Ramos, though, gave little away when the subject was brought up during a Q&A to promote his upcoming new documentary series on Amazon Prime. \u201cI would like to say something, but there\u2019s nothing new to tell you. Everything is the same,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cI have just been thinking about coming back from my injury, to try to finish the season the best way possible, to fight well and get close to the titles which are at stake. \u201cIn terms of (contract) renewal, there is no news I can tell you today.

I\u2019m honest, humble and hard working. It is on the basis of performance that the player should be judged. \u201cI can play five more years at the highest level.

Gene mutations are inherited - you receive one copy of the MTHFR gene from each of your parents.*\u00a0MTHFR is a gene that provides the body with instructions for making a certain enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). When you eat foods that contain folic acid, MTHFR converts it into methyl-folate (folate's active form).\u00a0*\u00a0Methyl-folate is critical to methylation, which helps to optimise a huge number of processes in your body including the production of DNA, metabolism of hormones, and proper detoxification.\u00a0* There are a number of ways you can find out if you have MTHFR.

He has only started four times during this disrupted campaign, the last of which came at the Etihad Stadium against West Ham on February 27.Aguero missed four weeks in the autumn, having damaged his hamstring in the first meeting against David Moyes's side on October 24, but since returning from the bench against Olympiacos in the Champions League on November 23, he has played just 171 minutes.         The striker is increasingly disillusioned with the way Pep Guardiola is using him this season         Aguero's season has been hampered by injury but he's hardly played since regaining fitnessIt has led the 32-year-old to believe Guardiola has already made a decision. City insist that is not the case and are adamant that Aguero's outstanding achievements in the past decade \u2013 he has scored 254 goals since his \u00a335million move from Atletico Madrid \u2013 entitle him to leave on his own terms.Guardiola said on Tuesday: 'We have to be calm. The club will speak to his agent.'Signing a marquee striker in the next window will be a priority for City \u2013 the club's technical staff are firm admirers of Joao Felix, Atletico Madrid's outstanding young forward \u2013 and Aguero, remarkably, is without a goal in the Premier League since January 21, 2020.But he is irritated that he is not getting opportunities to change that anomaly. Guardiola's argument is that Aguero is not physically at the level to complete 90 minutes consistently and the tension around games means this is not the moment to ease players in.Aguero overcame a difficult first 12 months with Guardiola in 2016-17 \u2013 particularly when he had a spell in and out of the side shortly after Gabriel Jesus had been signed \u2013 but he made tweaks to his game and became City's talisman.There are, however, some parallels in that Guardiola is not reliant on City's No 10 and it is likely he Aguero will seek talks with his manager.

        "full article": "By Dania Nadeem and Carl O'Donnell March 11 (Reuters) - Novavax Inc's COVID-19 vaccine was 96% effective in preventing cases caused by the original version of the coronavirus in a late-stage trial conducted in the United Kingdom, the company said on Thursday, moving it a step closer to regulatory approval. The vaccine was also about 86% effective in protecting against the more contagious virus variant first discovered and now prevalent in the UK. It was only around 55% effective in a separate, smaller trial in South Africa, where volunteers were primarily exposed to another newer, more contagious variant that is widely circulating there and spreading around the world. In both trials, the vaccine was 100% effective in preventing serious illness and death. Results from the final analysis of the UK trial were largely in line with interim data released in January, which also showed the Novavax shot to be 96% effective against the original version of the coronavirus and around 86% effective against UK variant. The company expects to use the data to submit for regulatory authorization in various countries. It is not clear when it will seek U.S. authorization or if regulators will require it to complete an ongoing trial in the United States.

        "title": "Ethiopian 737 MAX crash families set to obtain key Boeing documents",
        "full article": "By Tracy Rucinski March 11 (Reuters) - Families of victims of the deadly 2019 Ethiopian Airlines jet crash may obtain as soon as Thursday Boeing's reports to U.S. regulators that helped keep its 737 MAX flying after a prior disaster with the same jet in Indonesia five months earlier. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), an independent U.S. government investigative agency, told Boeing Co in a letter on Monday it should turn over nearly 2,000 documents to lawyers representing families who want to determine what the company knew about its flight systems after the Indonesian crash on Lion Air. The agency said international rules mandate the release of the documents after two years from the crash date, even though Ethiopia has yet to produce a final crash report which the agency cited in blocking the documents until now, according to the letter reviewed by Reuters. Boeing said it plans to produce the investigation-related information to the plaintiffs beginning today following the NTSB guidance that, at the second anniversary of the Ethiopian accident, the restrictions would be lifted. The plaintiffs lawyers said they expect the papers to show what Boeing executives knew of defects in the flight system of the newly designed aircraft following the Indonesian crash. An automated flight-control system called MCAS has been implicated in both crashes, which together killed 346 people. The plane continued to fly until the Ethiopian crash prompted a global grounding. \"What we want to see are the documents upon which Boeing resisted the grounding of the airplane and based its assertion to its customers that the airplane was safe,\" plaintiffs' attorney Justin Green told Reuters. Any evidence showing that Boeing executives were aware of the 737 MAX problems could expose Boeing to huge punitive damages, which are unusual in air transportation accidents because planes rarely fly with a known deadly defect. Boeing has already provided plaintiffs 112,587 documents encompassing millions of pages, Greene said, but the records under pursuit are believed to be an important part of the case. BUILDING A CASE Boeing has said it has implemented changes that ensure accidents like the ones in Indonesia and Ethiopia never happen again, and numerous aviation regulators have re-approved the plane for flight. The company resolved a 737 MAX criminal probe in January with a $2.5 billion Department of Justice settlement and has mostly settled the Lion Air crash litigation. It still faces an investor lawsuit in Delaware against its board and around 140 lawsuits by families of the Ethiopian crash. In the DOJ settlement Boeing admitted that two of its 737 MAX technical pilots, who are still under criminal investigation, had deceived the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about MCAS. While the settlement exonerated Boeing's senior managers, legal experts said it bolsters one part of the plaintiffs' punitive claim that Boeing intended to defraud the FAA and succeeded. However, the experts said punitive damages are rarely awarded in aircraft crash cases, in part because they are difficult to prove. Boeing could argue, for example, that the Ethiopian Airlines' pilots were informed after the Lion Air crash about the steps to follow in the event of an MCAS failure, said Kenneth Quinn of International Aviation Law. Still, Boeing will likely work hard to settle the cases and avoid a jury trial, a path followed by most companies involved in crash lawsuits, according to Gary Kennedy, former general counsel for American Airlines. \"From the company's perspective, the worst thing is a headline that relives the final moments of someone's life onboard that aircraft,\" said Kennedy, who was with American during litigation stemming from the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and a separate deadly crash in New York two months later.

The right-hander threw 20 pitches, all fastballs, off a mound Tuesday, Yankees manager Aaron Boone revealed Thursday. \"It was a lot of fun for me to get over there on Tuesday morning to be there to see that first one and just to see how he's moving around,\" Boone said. \"There's just a confidence ... he's kind of exuding in his health, just watching him play catch, the way his body is, the kind of shape he's in and the free and easy way in which he's throwing. He was really efficient the other day -- really kind of throwing it exactly where he wanted. He was coming out hot. We almost said, `Hey, back off a little bit. It's coming out a little too well.\" After taking Wednesday off, he was scheduled to throw off flat ground Thursday. The 27-year-old had elbow surgery Feb. 27, 2020. A two-time All-Star, Severino has appeared in 99 games (88 starts), all with the Yankees, and is 42-26 with a 3.46 ERA. --Field Level Media",

Coronavirus variants could cause third wave in Ontario: expert panel New variants of the coronavirus are spreading rapidly in Ontario and unless they are better controlled, the province risks facing a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, an expert panel advising the province's government said on Thursday. It warned that the next few weeks are critical as the progress made in bringing the coronavirus under control in the province has stalled. Exclusive: EU told to expect no AstraZeneca vaccines from U.S. in near future - sources Washington has told the European Union that it should not expect to receive AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in the United States any time soon, two EU sources said on Thursday, in a new blow to the bloc's supplies. The U.S. message could complicate vaccination plans in the 27-nation EU, which has been grappling since January with delays in deliveries from vaccine makers. Special Report: Insider alleges Eli Lilly blocked her efforts to sound alarms about U.S. drug factory (Reuters) - On a chilly spring morning in 2019, Amrit Mula arrived in her office at pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co's factory in Branchburg, New Jersey, to find a desk drawer open that she had kept locked. Her files were missing. Mula was a top human resources officer at what was one of America's largest biotech plants. Over the years, she had been investigating employee complaints about manufacturing problems related to multiple drugs, including the company's blockbuster diabetes medication, Trulicity, according to internal company documents and email correspondence reviewed by Reuters. Pfizer/BioNTech say data suggests vaccine 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infection Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE said on Thursday that real-world data from Israel suggests their COVID-19 vaccine is 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infections, meaning it could significantly reduce transmission. The companies also said the latest analysis of the Israeli data shows the vaccine was 97% effective in preventing symptomatic disease, severe disease and death. That is basically in line with the 95% efficacy Pfizer and BioNTech reported from the vaccine's late-stage clinical trial in December. Exclusive: Sacklers boost opioid settlement offer to $4.3 billion - sources Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP have offered roughly $4.3 billion to resolve sprawling opioid litigation, up from $3 billion initially proposed in settlement discussions underway in the OxyContin maker's bankruptcy proceedings, four people familiar with the matter said. Sackler family members are now willing to contribute $4.275 billion to help settle about 3,000 lawsuits brought by U.S. communities seeking to hold them and Purdue responsible for damage wrought by the opioid epidemic, the sources said. Denmark, Norway and Iceland suspend AstraZeneca COVID shots after blood clot reports Health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland on Thursday suspended the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine following reports of the formation of blood clots in some people who had been vaccinated. Austria earlier stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism. J&amp;J to make up to three billion COVID-19 vaccines in 2022: chief scientist Johnson &amp; Johnson's chief scientist said the company expects to produce up to 3 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine next year, after the European Union approved the one-shot immunization on Thursday. The company is bringing on three manufacturing plants to produce the key drug substance. It also will have seven plants globally that will handle final production steps and bottling into vials known as fill and finish. Pfizer vaccine production on the rise as pandemic hits one-year mark Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE will exceed their original global production target for COVID-19 vaccines by as much as 20% this year, as they ramp up production a year into the global pandemic, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Thursday. The companies also released real-world data from Israel earlier on Thursday suggesting their vaccine was 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infections, suggesting it could significantly reduce virus transmission. Hungary publishes Chinese, Russian vaccine contracts amid COVID-19 surge Hungary said on Thursday it was paying the equivalent of about $37.50 per dose for Chinese company Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine and $9.95 per dose for the Russian Sputnik-V vaccine, adding it was publishing the purchase contracts to push for more transparency. \"Hungary's government stands for making vaccine contracts public,\" Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas wrote on Facebook, attaching 30 pages of documents that appeared to be the vaccine contracts. Europe clears J&amp;J's single-shot COVID-19 vaccine as roll-out falters Europe approved Johnson &amp; Johnson's single dose COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, paving the way for the first shots to be delivered in a month as the bloc seeks to speed up a stuttering inoculation campaign and boost its supplies. The COVID-19 shot is the fourth to be endorsed for use in the European Union after vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-Oxford University and Moderna, and is recommended for those over 18 years of age, the European Medicines agency (EMA) said.

        "title": "EXPLAINER: Ex-cop trial to include 'spark of life' on Floyd",
        "full article": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Prosecutors trying a white former Minneapolis police officer in George Floyd's death plan to use a legal doctrine called \"spark of life\" to humanize Floyd in front of jurors. It\u00b4s a doctrine with roots in a 1985 state Supreme Court case, and one that several legal experts said makes Minnesota a rarity in explicitly permitting such testimony ahead of a verdict. Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank told Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill on Wednesday that he plans to invoke the doctrine during Derek Chauvin's trial. It allows prosecutors to call witnesses to testify about crime victims' lives, ostensibly to portray them as more than a statistic. Defense attorneys complain the doctrine allows prosecutors to play on jurors' emotions and has nothing to do with evidence. If Cahill allows prosecutors to go too far, he could hand Chauvin grounds for an appeal. Here's a look at the doctrine and the potential ramifications of it coming into play during Chauvin's trial. WHAT IS THE \"SPARK OF LIFE\" DOCTRINE? The doctrine emerged in 1985 when a defendant accused of killing a police officer argued to the Minnesota Supreme Court that the prosecutor prejudiced the jury with a speech about the officer's childhood, his parents and his marriage. The prosecutor became so emotional the trial court had to take a recess.          In this image taken from video, defense attorney Eric Nelson, left, and defendant, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, right, listen to Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill during pretrial motions, prior to continuing jury selection in the trial of Chauvin, Thursday, March 11, 2021, at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Minn. Chauvin is accused in the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd. (Court TV/Pool via Pool)  The Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors could present evidence that a murder victim was \"not just bones and sinews covered with flesh, but was imbued with the spark of life. The prosecution has some leeway to show that spark and present the victim as a human being as long as it is not an \"attempt to invoke any undue sympathy or inflame the jury\u00b4s passions.\" HOW IS SPARK-OF-LIFE TESTIMONY RELEVANT? Victim statements about the impact a crime has had on their lives are common during the sentencing portion of trials across the country. But allowing the introduction of deep biographical information about a victim ahead of a verdict is rarer. The idea is to use witnesses to present a victim as a human being, essentially allowing the victim to speak from beyond the grave, legal observers say. \"This puts some personal nature back into the case for somebody who's treated so impersonally in an unfortunately biased system,\" Frank told Cahill. Defense attorneys counter that the doctrine allows prosecutors to play on jurors' emotions and contributes nothing to jurors' understanding of the crime. \"I've never encountered this before,\" said John Gross, an associate law professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has worked as a public defender in New York City and taught criminal defense strategies at Syracuse University and the University of Alabama. \"It's pretty obvious how much potential prejudice that could have on the jury. It's a little surprising to me this is potentially fair game in Minnesota. If it isn't evidence of guilt, why is it there?\" HOW FAR CAN THE PROSECUTOR GO? The doctrine gives judges tremendous discretion on what to allow during spark-of-life testimony. Frank told Cahill he plans to bring in photographs of Floyd at various stages of his life and present at least two witnesses. He described one as a family member who will speak about Floyd's family, his childhood, how Floyd's mother was important to him and how Floyd was \"a brother to this witness,\" Frank said. The other witness will testify about Floyd's life since he moved to Minnesota from Houston in 2014, Frank said, as well as his drug use in an attempt to head off Chauvin's attorneys. The defense is expected to argue that Floyd's drug use killed him, not Chauvin's decision to press his knee into Floyd's neck for around nine minutes. Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson noted such testimony should be limited and they will face cross-examination if the testimony becomes too fawning. Cahill said he won't allow cross-examination about Floyd's drug use but testimony about whether Floyd was a peaceful person or prone to violence could open the door to the defense introducing evidence of his criminal record. \"It can't go on for too long because it distracts from the merits,\" the judge said. COULD THE STRATEGY BACKFIRE ON PROSECUTORS? Yes. If defense attorneys are allowed on cross-examination to introduce Floyd's criminal record and drug problems they could raise doubts about what killed him in jurors' minds. If the state's witnesses offer too much information Chauvin could argue on appeal that Cahill let too much spark-of-life testimony in. \"It puts a judge in a precarious position,\" said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. \"If too much is brought in, does it set up the possibility of an appeal, that the judge erred and allowed too much emotion? The smart defense attorneys will figure out how to use this.\" ___ Find AP's full coverage of the death of George Floyd: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd          In this image taken from video, defense attorney Eric Nelson speaks to Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill during pretrial motions, prior to continuing jury selection in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Thursday, March 11, 2021, at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Minn.

I love my kids, and I\u2019m told I\u2019m a pretty good dad, and sometimes I enjoy it... but most of the time it\u2019s just draining,' he wrote.\u00a0'I explain it as being like an introvert at a party full of strangers \u2014 it\u2019s not that caring for kids is painful or whatnot, just like talking to strangers isn\u2019t painful. It\u2019s just draining. It sucks the energy out of you, whether you\u2019re good at it or not.\u00a0\u00a0'I understand that there are people out there who enjoy spending time with kids, just like there are people who enjoy talking to strangers \u2014 and suffice it to say I\u2019m just not one of them,' he added.\u00a0\u00a0                                                               Feeling drained:\u00a0Some of the parents said they love their children but miss their old lives'So I guess I want my kids, but what I really want is for my kids to magically be old enough that they\u2019re no longer draining, and for me to get my life back a little.'\u00a0One parent admitted to not having any love for the child, saying: 'I've just been trying to fake it until I make it and there's a connection. Seven years now and nothing but disdain for the child. I see a therapist weekly but it doesn't help.'Without going into detail, another person explained: 'You hate them, and you hate yourself for hating them.'\u00a0Some of the parents said they were resentful that they are stuck raising their nieces and nephews because their siblings are unfit parents.\u00a0'I have custody of my brother's kids. I didn't want them,' one person confessed. 'My brother's kids are not as well behaved as my children. It is very frustrating. I love them. I will protect them and take care of them. I find myself very upset by the fact that I just can't seem to love them as much as my children. It's depressing.\u00a0                                    Hard to handle:\u00a0Some of the parents said they were resentful that they are stuck raising their nieces and nephews because their siblings are unfit parents'I hate myself because I feel this way. I wish it was just my children a lot of the time. My brother's kids put a strain on my marital relationship, because they act out so much.'\u00a0\u00a0A number of the parents who responded in the thread were struggling to raise children with severe special needs, something they didn't anticipate when they decided to have a baby.\u00a0One mom who has a six-year-old daughter who is severely autistic with a global developmental delay said her child is 'non-verbal' and 'screams for hours' every day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'I don't feel like a mom, I feel like a caregiver. I get little joy in taking care of her and I am constantly worn down. I'm exhausted,' she said.\u00a0'This is going to sound absolutely terrible and this is why I'm using an alt. but raising her is not like raising a child. You raise a child to be a decent adult \u2014 you teach them manners, respect, education and kindness and you hope that as they grow up they will make friends, get good grades in school and go on to have a fulfilling life.\u00a0                           Feeling drained: Many of the parents who have special needs children said they feel like 'caretakers,' not parents'This feels like I am raising a very high maintenance pet that will not evolve into anything more.'\u00a0Other parents with special needs children could relate.\u00a0'When you have a kid you kinda get this idea in your head on how things are gonna be. How you're going to teach them things, share special moments as they learn and have this cool amazing bond,' one person explained. 'Then your kid comes into this world and is not at all what you expect.\u00a0'My kid is special needs and has major developmental delays. He's two and basically just lives in his own world. Doesn't communicate, doesn't respond to his name and has basically missed every single milestone out there.'The Reddit user confessed to feeling a range of negative emotions, including regret,\u00a0 despair, and guilt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It wasn't his fault he came into the world this way. He didn't ask to be here. So there's a lot of complex emotions going on,' the parent added. 'However bad it makes me feel though \u2014 I just kind of wish he didn't exist.'",

Occasionally you see somebody who has two of these qualities. Very rarely someone such as the great Bryan Robson comes along with all three.This 22-year-old is the playmaking type who has already packed more than 100 games into his short career. A friend suggested I assess him and I was pleasantly surprised by his quality.\u00a0Playing on the left side of a midfield three, he showed enough ability to make me query why he has not played at a higher level. Here, I saw calmness, composure and the vision to spot a precise pass.When hemmed in by the corner flag, he produced a lovely shimmy to cross a delightful deep ball. He was the hub of the team and there was an expectation that when he was on the ball near the opponents\u2019 penalty area, he would create a goal chance.At close quarters, he showed lovely balance as he trapped the ball in one movement, and slid it past two challenges.

        "full article": "By Mathieu Rosemain and Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle Barzic PARIS, March 11 (Reuters) - French conglomerates Vivendi and Bouygues are among the bidders for Bertelsmann's controlling stake in French broadcasting group M6, two sources close to the matter told Reuters. French telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel and Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky are also interested in buying the M6 stake held by Bertelsmann's RTL Group subsidiary, added the sources, who asked for anonymity because the talks are private. Italy's biggest commercial broadcaster, Mediaset, is also looking into the asset, a separate source said. RTL's 48% stake in M6 had a market value of about 1.1 billion euros ($1.32 billion), according to the French company's closing share price on Thursday. Reuters reported in January that Bertelsmann had approached potential bidders including Vivendi and telecoms firm Altice Europe about selling its stake in M6. Vivendi, Bouygues, Mediaset and Bertelsmann declined to comment. Niel and Altice Europe were not immediately available for comment. Etienne Bertier, chairman of CMI France, Kretinsky's media entity in France, also declined to comment. A full sale of RTL's stake in M6 would mark the departure of Bertelsmann from France after it agreed to sell Prisma Media, France's No. 1 print magazines group, to Vivendi in December. Vivendi's chief executive, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, said earlier this month that the media giant, controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore, was \"scrutinizing\" the potential sale of RTL's stake in M6. RTL, which will report full-year earnings on Friday, reiterated comments made in January that there was a \"strong case for consolidation in the European broadcasting sector\" and the it was reviewing its options. French newspaper Les Echos was first in reporting that at least four candidates were interested in the purchase of RTL's stake in M6, citing Vivendi, Bouygues' subsidiary TF1, Niel and Kretinsky.

WGME-TV's Taylor Cairns was shocked to receive the call Monday evening while at the scene of an armed standoff in Livermore Falls, Maine. He informed police who used the phone to continue a conversation with the suspect while posing as a reporter. WGME-TV said it was alarmed and reached out to state police for answers. State Police Maj. Bill Ross called it an impromptu decision and a \"unique circumstance\" and acknowledged it was \"not a good practice.\" The hours-long standoff ended with the suspect, Donald White, dead and all three hostages safely released. White, 44, was shot by a trooper and took his own life with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities also found multiple explosive devices in the home. Police posing as journalist sets a dangerous precedent that lead to blurred roles and an erosion of public trust in journalism, critics said. The phone never should have been handed to police \"without a warrant or other legal means of compulsion,\" Michael Socolow, a journalism professor at the University of Maine, told the Bangor Daily News. Dan Kennedy, a professor of media ethics at Northeastern University, agreed that the incident \"raises media ethics concerns\" but recognized that \"in-the-moment\" decisions were required. \"You can see what a difficult situation everybody was in,\" Kennedy told the newspaper. \"Lives were at stake here.\" Maine State Police and the TV station declined further comment Thursday.

        "full article": "CLEVELAND (AP) - A federal judge in Ohio has ruled that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lacked the authority to issue a nationwide moratorium on rental evictions, the second such ruling issued by a federal judge in two weeks. U.S. District Judge J. Philip Calabrese, sitting in Cleveland, ruled Wednesday that the CDC went beyond what the federal Public Health Service Act allows it to do in ordering a halt to evictions. However, he did not grant an injunction that would have stopped the agency from enforcing the moratorium. The ruling comes two weeks after U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker in the Eastern District of Texas determined that the moratorium was unconstitutional. The Justice Department is appealing that order. The National Association of Homebuilders and a group of property owners from across northern Ohio had filed a federal lawsuit last October, claiming the CDC\u00b4s order was overreaching and arbitrary. The chair of the NAHB said the group was pleased with the judge's ruling. \"Saddling landlords with the responsibility to provide free rent during this pandemic ignores their financial obligations and ability to provide safe, decent and affordable housing,\" Chuck Fowke said in a statement. \"Even during emergencies, federal agencies must abide by the law.\" The suit was one of several filed in federal courts across the country by property owners who have struggled financially because of the coronavirus. Other courts around the country have upheld the eviction ban, said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. She added that challenges to the moratorium made little sense when tens of billions of dollars in federal rental assistance are coming in the recently passed coronavirus relief bill. \"These attempts to overturn the moratorium are frivolous,\" Yentel said. \"These landlords that are bringing these suits and working so hard to overturn the eviction moratorium will be made whole by the unprecedented amount of resources that Congress has made available. But it is going to take time to get the money into their hands.\" The CDC eviction moratorium was signed in September by President Donald Trump and extended by President Joe Biden through March 31.",

Amp Energy of Ontario, is taking the initial steps to use up to 190 acres on several parcels of land in Shutesbury, owned by W.D.

Amp is dangling the promise of $450,000 for the town in the first year of payment in lieu of taxes through what is called a municipal partnership.

Tyra Cox added 21 points with seven 3-pointers - both career highs - as FGCU made 15 of 48 for its 300th straight game with at least 10 made 3s. The Eagles were 9 of 29 from distance in the first half. Morehouse was 10 of 16 from the field for the fifth-most points an Eagle has scored in an ASUN tournament game. Deshari Graham scored 15 points and Ashley Malone added 12 for Jacksonville (4-17). ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",

        "full article": "By Hugo Greenhalgh LONDON, March 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A British charity on Thursday launched the world's first fund to support LGBT+ people whose vulnerability to climate change is worsened by poverty and discrimination. The LGBTQI Climate Fund will give up to 5,000 pounds ($6,987) to campaigners advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in climate-related emergencies, said GiveOut, which gives grants to LGBT+ organisations globally. \"LGBTQI people face disproportionate economic hardship (due to climate change),\" Lee Dibben, a spokesperson at GiveOut, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"They're not sat at the table and are being excluded from government decision-making.\" Extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts and hurricanes, are becoming increasingly common with climate change forcing people from their homes, disrupting services and stoking conflict over resources. LGBT+ people often face heightened risks from such disasters because they find it hard to secure well-paid jobs, safe housing and government services in developing countries where gay sex is a crime and discrimination against trans people widespread. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - when some 1.2 million people were evacuated in the worst disaster in U.S. history - trans people faced discrimination in emergency shelters in New Orleans, with some even being turned away, local media reported. Similarly, Dibben said LGBT+ people reported feeling unwelcome in shelters run by religious organisations during the cyclone season in the Pacific island nation of Tonga. One of GiveOut's grantees, the Tonga Leitis Association, has been training those in charge of emergency shelters to accommodate LGBT+ people, and is campaigning for their inclusion in consultations on climate change measures. In its first year, the LGBTQI Climate Fund aims to raise 15,000 to 30,000 pounds for smaller LGBT+ groups around the world. Dibben said GiveOut hoped to encourage more corporate sponsors to join electric vehicle start-up ev.energy in supporting the fund to help finance research, local initiatives and enable activists to attend climate change conferences. Leaders in developing countries and the United Nations chief Antonio Guterres last year called on rich countries to give more financial support to cut emissions and protect people in poorer countries from extreme weather and rising seas.

        "full article": "The NFL lost $4 billion in revenues in 2020 compared to the prior year, the Sports Business Journal reported Thursday. Citing a source, the publication said revenues in 2020 totaled $12 billion, down from $16 billion in 2019 -- a drop of 25 percent. Revenues had been projected to reach $16.5 billion. And while the NFL played a full 16-game season, plus the playoffs, in 2020, games were played with limited or no fans in attendance because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bulk of the revenue decline was absorbed by the individual teams, who couldn't benefit from sales revenue tied to tickets, parking and concessions or local sponsorships during the pandemic. League revenues, which reached $9.5 billion in 2019, did not incur as steep of a drop because the NFL received full media payments, Sports Business Journal said. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has joined the campaign to increase the superannuation rate. The federal government is considering abandoning its legislated promise to raise the super guarantee, arguing it could come at the cost of jobs and wage rises. But Industry Super Australia has commissioned a study that found lifting the guarantee to 12 per cent would grow the economy by $12 billion, grow wages and create more than 10,000 jobs. Mr Turnbull has added his voice to the campaign, in a move likely to infuriate some members of the Morrison government. \"Australia's superannuation system is the envy of the world,\" he said on Friday. \"The legislated increase to 12 per cent should be maintained, not just to deliver a more secure retirement for millions of Australians, but to build stronger economic growth and higher wages.\" ISA chairman Greg Combet said the report dispelled the myth that once money went into super it simply \"disappeared into thin air\". \"We know that's not the case and the pool of patient capital has a positive and lasting impact on employment, wages and economic growth,\" he said. \"The consequences of cutting super are crystal clear - it leads to permanently slashed wages, jobs lost, and the economy crimped all while adding to the aged pension and leaving Australians far worse off in retirement.'",

        "full article": "CARSON, Calif. (AP) - French midfielder Samuel Grandsir has agreed to a three-year contract with the LA Galaxy. The Galaxy announced the move Thursday for Grandsir, who had been with AS Monaco since 2018. The 24-year-old Grandsir made only 12 appearances for Monaco, which acquired him from Troyes. He scored three goals while spending last season on loan with Brest, and he spent part of the 2018-19 season on loan with Strasbourg. \"Samuel is an attack-minded, talented player who will strengthen our roster,\" Galaxy general manager Dennis te Kloese said. \"He has demonstrated to be an outstanding and talented player in a very respected and competitive league. We are confident he will show his potential.\" The Galaxy signed Grandsir with targeted allocation money, and he will occupy an international roster spot. The Galaxy's offseason moves had focused largely on their defense, with the club acquiring defenders Jorge Villafa\u00f1a, Oniel Fisher and Derrick Williams along with goalkeeper Jonathan Bond. The five-time MLS Cup champion franchise still has a third designated player spot open alongside Javier \"Chicharito\" Hern\u00e1ndez and Jonathan Dos Santos. Cristian Pav\u00f3n occupied that spot in 2020, but the 25-year-old forward's future is unclear after he was charged with sexual abuse in his native Argentina earlier this month. Attorneys representing Pav\u00f3n have strenuously denied the allegations against him. The Galaxy had been negotiating to reacquire Pav\u00f3n, who returned to Boca Juniors in the winter after spending the past 1 1/2 seasons on loan in Los Angeles. The Galaxy open their preseason schedule March 20, with their season opener set for April 18 in Miami. Their home opener is April 25 against the New York Red Bulls. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

Find the best deal using our calculator      Now, turning convention on its head, swings and hammocks are increasingly popping up in living rooms and other social spaces, suspended from ceilings or frames as either a focal point of a room or as a curious addition to a room's atmosphere.STYLISH 'SEATS''Swings are an item of nostalgia, conjuring up the best childhood memories,' says Charlotte Clemons of From The Oak Tree, a personalised oak gift company.'We have created swings for people's homes to hang from beautiful beams, ceiling joists and frames. It offers an extra seat but also brings a sense of adventure to a home.'If it is now wrong to assume that swings are just for the garden, it would also be incorrect to say that they are reserved for those who have large spaces.In fact, they can help solve the opposite problem. Given that neither touches the ground, one's eye travels through the item, meaning it will not add clutter to a room, or take up much space.         They are on the large side but a hammock offers more design options than a suspended swingOn the contrary, in a difficult room to decorate, for example in a long space, a swing can do the job of dividing without the need for walls.Hannah Foster, owner of online boutique Gift Pop, is delighted with her indoor swing, a welcome addition to her recently-acquired industrial rural barn in Berkshire.'Happiness is the swing in our kitchen,' she tells me from Berkshire, from where she runs her business. 'Everyone who visits wants a go. I get to chat to the children for five minutes longer if they are on the swing.\u00a0'As they need to hold on, they can't be on a phone.

Ibbi Interiors has a range of unusual, yet charming, seating options for both inside and out.So don't let the garden hog your favourite furniture: just bring it indoors. It will work come rain or shine. What your home really needs is... Gingham\u00a0 Gingham is set to be one of the top homeware trends this spring and summer. Yes, the red-and-white tablecloth beloved of louche 1960s bistros is back.Some believe the roots of the word gingham lie in the Malay language; others say it takes its name from Guingamp, a town in Brittany, where the fabric was made.         Scotts of Stow has a red and white tablecloth, (pictured), (\u00a312.95 to \u00a319.95, scottsof stow.co.uk)Your home needs a gingham item now because it has a wholesome feel, while also looking contemporary.Arlo & Jacob's gingham Helena Sofa (\u00a32,227) is sharp but comfortable.\u00a0However, your outlay on gingham need only be modest.

        "title": "Gallo's early power surge brings hope for big 2021 season",
        "full article": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) - Joey Gallo's spent several spring trainings in Arizona so the Texas Rangers slugger knows the difference between a real homer and the cheap high fly balls that can drift out of the park in the forgiving desert air. The 27-year-old says his power surge through the first two weeks of exhibition games is for real. \"It\u00b4s a different environment, it\u00b4s a different field,\" Gallo said. \"But for me, look, I know I have power. I know the balls that I\u00b4ve hit so far this spring would probably go out of Globe Life Field anyway.\" Gallo has hit an MLB-high five homers through his first seven games, giving the Rangers hope that he can bounce back from a tough 2020 season. The 6-foot-5, 250-pounder has always had an all-or-nothing approach that often ends in a homer, walk or a strikeout. But in last year's pandemic-shortened season, it was a lot more \"nothing\" than \"all.\" He finished with a .181 batting average and 10 homers which is one of many reasons the Rangers finished last in the AL West with a 22-38 record.          Texas Rangers' Joey Gallo gestures as he crosses home plate on a home run during the first inning of the team's spring training baseball game against the Cleveland Indians, Tuesday, March 9, 2021, in Surprise, Ariz. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)  Gallo's hoping to return to his 2019 All-Star form when he had a career-high .253 batting average and .389 on-base percentage. He's pleased with his start but also understands it only matters if it carries over into April. \"I wish these counted,\" Gallo said. \"That would be awesome, but they don\u00b4t.\" Here are a few other players who were impressive during the first two weeks of exhibition action. ___ 1B Matt Olson, Athletics: The Athletics slugger is much like Gallo in trying to bounce back from an uneven 2020 when he hit just .195, though he did have a team-high 14 homers. He's had a good start with seven hits in his first 14 at-bats, including three homers and three doubles. LHP Madison Bumgarner, Diamondbacks: The four-time All-Star had an encouraging first outing, striking out six batters over two innings while giving up one hit. The 31-year-old signed an $85 million, five-year deal with D-backs before last season but struggled in 2020 when he finished with a 1-4 record and a 6.48 ERA. Also encouraging: His fastball velocity was back in the 90-91 mph range after sitting in the high 80s for much of last year. 2B/SS/3B Nico Hoerner, Cubs: The versatile Hoerner can play just about anywhere and is looking like he might be ready to take a step forward offensively. Chicago's 2018 first-round pick out of Stanford has nine hits in his first 13 at-bats, including three doubles and a homer. He could potentially be the team's starting second baseman on opening day. LHP Robbie Ray, Blue Jays: The 2017 All-Star had a tough time with his control last season - walking 45 batters in 51 2/3 innings - and was dealt at the trade deadline from Arizona to Toronto. He's shown dominant stuff at different points throughout his career and struck out a career-high 235 batters in 2019. He's looked closer to that version through two starts, striking out eight batters in 4 1/3 innings 2B Brendan Rodgers, Rockies: The third overall draft pick in 2015 has seven hits in his first 18 at-bats, including two homers, and looks like he might be able to seize the starting job at second base. The 24-year-old has been a top prospect for several years and hit .350 with nine homers in 2019 at Triple-A Albuquerque. RHP Lance Lynn, White Sox: Chicago added the 33-year-old in an offseason trade and his first two starts have been solid. He's given up no runs over 4 2/3 innings while striking out eight. The durable right-hander pitched an MLB-high 84 innings for the Rangers last season and had a 6-3 record with a 3.32 ERA. ___ AP Baseball Writer Stephen Hawkins contributed to this report. ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          Texas Rangers' Joey Gallo, right, celebrates with Isiah Kiner-Falefa after hitting a two-run home run during the first inning of a spring training baseball game against the Kansas City Royals, Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, in Surprise, Ariz.

(AP) - Trinidad and Tobago national team regular Joevin Jones agreed Thursday to a two-year contract with David Beckham's Inter Miami of Major League Soccer. A 29-year-old old midfielder and left back, Jones has nine goals in 76 international appearances and was a second-half substitute in the Soca Warriors' 2-1 win over the United States in October 2017 that prevented the Americans from reaching the World Cup. Jones has played for W Connection (2009-14), HJK Helsinki (2014), the Chicago Fire (2015), the Seattle Sounders (2016-17, 2019-20) and Darmstadt (2018-19).

        "full article": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Luis Palau, an evangelical pastor who was born in Argentina and went on to work with Billy Graham before establishing his own powerhouse international ministry, died Thursday. He was 86. The Luis Palau Association said he died at his home in Portland, Oregon. He had announced in January 2018 that he had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. \"It is with a mixture of sadness and joy that we share with you that Dad passed away early this morning. He died suddenly and very peacefully, just as he had hoped,\" his family said in a statement Thursday. \"This is hard news, but Luis is experiencing the beauty of the Lord face to face.\" Born to an affluent family in Buenos Aires, Palau rose from obscurity to become one of the most well-known international Christian evangelists. Over a career that spanned more than half a century, he authored 50 books and addressed 30 million people in 75 countries at evangelical \"festivals\" that were his modern-day take on the more traditional crusades that boosted his mentor and idol, Graham, to fame. \"In many ways, I feel the Lord has much more in store for me. Yet whatever tomorrow holds - I\u00b4m completely at peace. Both Patricia and I are,\" he wrote to his followers after the diagnosis. \"As we look back, we praise the Lord. Fifty-seven years of marriage. How many places we\u00b4ve been. How many people we\u00b4ve reached with the Gospel.\" His radio programs, including the international Spanish-language \"Luis Palau Responde,\" are broadcast on 3,500 stations in 48 countries, and his Portland-based Luis Palau Association organizes dozens of events each year on five continents.          FILE - In this March 20, 2003 file photo Argentinian evangelist Luis Palau, left, discusses preparation's for BeachFest, his multi-media Christian revival, with assistant Fred Conklin as they stroll Fort Lauderdale Beach, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Palau, an evangelical pastor who was born in Argentina and went on to work as Billy Graham's Spanish interpreter before establishing his own international ministry, died Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Portland, Ore. He was 86. (AP Photo/Marianne Armshaw, File)  The vastness of his evangelical empire, especially among Spanish-speaking faithful, long ago earned him the nickname the \"Billy Graham of Latin America.\" A decade ago, Palau began transferring day-to-day operations of that empire to three of his four sons, including one who is now an international evangelist in his own right. \"Everything is ready, so if the Lord wants to take me home ... I\u00b4m ready,\" he said in a January 2018 video to his followers. \"I\u00b4ve preached about heaven ... and I\u00b4ve often preached about the second coming and the resurrection, and now, it\u00b4s reality for me.\" Condolences came in from other faith leaders as news of Palau's death spread Thursday. \"Luis Palau was the Apostle Paul to the Spanish-speaking world. He was a leader whom God used him to usher in the great revival that swept South and Central America, and that was just the beginning,\" said the Rev. Johnnie Moore, president of The Congress of Christian Leaders. \"Today, we lost a giant in Christian history.\" James Dobson, who broadcasts the Christian radio program \"Family Talk\" to 1,300 stations, called Palau \"a beloved friend.\" \"His passion for sharing Jesus Christ around the world was immeasurable,\" he said in a statement. Palau was steeped in faith early in life by his father, a businessman who had been introduced to Christianity by a missionary. But when Palau\u00b4s father died suddenly, the family fell on hard times. In an autobiographical video interview on his website, Palau recalls his mother dividing a loaf of bread among her children or cutting a steak in eight pieces for dinner. Palau, who had hoped to become a lawyer, was working an entry-level job at a bank when he heard Graham on the radio in 1952. It was transformative, he would later say, and Palau decided he wanted to become an evangelist himself one day. \"I would have gladly had a business or been a lawyer - either one - but the real commitment of my life was to win people to Jesus Christ. There\u00b4s nothing greater in the whole world,\" he said in an interview on his website. Palau moved to Oregon in 1960 to attend the Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland and met his future wife, a fellow Bible school student named Pat. The couple married in 1961 and had four sons, building their early family life around missionary work. Palau interned with Graham in 1962 during a crusade in Fresno, California, and served as Graham\u00b4s Spanish-language interpreter during crusades in South and Central America in the 1960s. Palau began his Spanish-language radio program in Colombia and gave sermons in Latin America throughout the 1970s. Now a U.S. citizen, Palau began attracting tens of thousands to his appearances in Colombia, Peru, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico and Spain. In 1978, Palau incorporated his ministry in Portland and later set an attendance record at the city\u00b4s enormous waterfront park during an evangelist event. Reaching an American audience had presented a challenge. In 1999, Palau shifted his emphasis from traditional crusades - the longtime staple of evangelists - to edgier, more modern-feeling Christian outdoor \"festivals\" to draw nonbelievers. The events had corporate sponsors and featured Christian rock bands, skate parks and family activities. \"It revolutionized everything we do,\" Palau told The Associated Press in 2003. \"I\u00b4d never go back to the old model unless God held a gun to my head.\" ___ Follow Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus.",

        "full article": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Veronica Burton scored 25 points with 13 rebounds and six assists to lead fifth-seeded Northwestern over fourth-seeded and No. 13-ranked Michigan 65-49 on Thursday in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament. The game was tied at 30-all at halftime but the Wildcats held the Wolverines to a season-low 19 second-half points in avenging a pair of regular-season losses, including a 63-58 defeat last Saturday. Northwestern advances to the semifinals for the first time since 2016 where it will take on top-seeded and No. 7-ranked Maryland on Friday. The Terrapins beat eighth-seeded Nebraska 83-73 in Thursday's tournament opener. Burton, the two-time Big Ten defensive player of the year, was 7-of-14 shooting and 9 of 11 from the free-throw line in finishing two points shy of her career high. The double-double was her second this season. Lindsey Pulliam added 18 points, leaving her five shy of 2,000 for her career. Burton had a pair of baskets to cap a 6-0 run to start the second half and the Wildcats led thereafter, finishing the third quarter with another 6-0 run, including two buckets by Pulliam for a 46-38 lead. Three-pointers by Burton and Lauryn Satterwhite midway through the fourth made it a 14-point bulge and the lead remained in double figures. Conference player of the year Naz Hillmon scored 26 points with 12 rebounds for her 13th double-double this season, including nine of the Wolverines' 19 second-half points. Leigha Brown added 10 points and 10 rebounds for her first career double-double.

        "title": "J&J to make up to 3 bln COVID-19 vaccines in 2022 -chief scientist",
        "full article": "By Julie Steenhuysen and Ludwig Burger CHICAGO/FRANKFURT, March 11 (Reuters) - Johnson &amp; Johnson's chief scientist said the company expects to produce up to 3 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine next year, after the European Union approved the one-shot immunization on Thursday. The company is bringing on three manufacturing plants to produce the key drug substance. It also will have seven plants globally that will handle final production steps and bottling into vials known as fill and finish. \"All these will function together to deliver the 1 billion by the end of the year,\" Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&amp;J's chief scientific officer, said in an interview. \"Next year, we can do more than two billion vaccines, and even up to three if we maximize capacity. With Merck on board, we will be north of 2 billion,\" he added, referring to a recent agreement for rival Merck &amp; Co to produce J&amp;J's vaccine. Stoffels also said he was confident J&amp;J will be able to deliver a planned 55 million doses to the European Union in the second quarter. An EU official told Reuters this week that J&amp;J had flagged possible supply issues that may complicate these plans. \"We trust that we can deliver close to that amount in Q2,\" Stoffels said, adding that final production steps would be the biggest challenge. \"It\u00b4s the fill and finish which was the critical part and there we learned we had later access, we started later and had later access to facilities,\" he said. J&amp;J's shot is the fourth to be endorsed for use in the EU after vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech , AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc. Europe is scrambling to get immunization campaigns off the ground after an early supply shortfall from Pfizer, since resolved, and more persistent issues with AstraZeneca. J&amp;J\u00b4s vaccine is expected to be used widely around the globe because of its one-shot convenience and logistical advantage of being shipped and stored at normal refrigerator temperatures. Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two doses and must be shipped frozen. Thursday's approval included authorization in Europe of Maryland-based Emergent Biosolutions Inc, which is making active drug substance for the vaccine. \"Emergent is a very critical supplier. It\u00b4s important for both the U.S. and Europe and other parts of the world,\" Stoffels said, adding it can deliver enough drug substance for \"up to a billion vaccines a year.\" Stoffels said in the United States, the company was only allowed to seek emergency use authorization for one manufacturing plant to produce drug substance. Initial U.S. doses are being made at the company's plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. J&amp;J is awaiting U.S. approvals of the Emergent plant for drug substance, and for Catalent Inc , a contract manufacturer that will handle fill and finish from a new manufacturing line in Bloomington, Indiana. Stoffels said as soon as J&amp;J received U.S. authorization for the vaccine, U.S. regulators started reviewing the company's additional production plants. He said early \"hiccups\" have been resolved and the company expects to deliver on its promise of 100 million doses before the end of June. In Europe, Stoffels said the company plans to significantly scale up production of its Leiden plant. Additional capacity will come on board likely over the summer, he added. Indian drugmaker Biological E Ltd will handle both drug substance and fill and finish for J&amp;J's vaccine. The company's managing director told Reuters last month that Biological E was looking to contract manufacture roughly 600 million doses of J&amp;J's COVID-19 vaccine a year. Biological E is in the process of installing and validating equipment in the plant, which Stoffels said he expects to be ready in the second half of this year.

        "title": "IDB unveils new credit guarantee to remove COVID-19 vaccine sales hurdle",
        "full article": "By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) on Thursday unveiled what it called the first-ever financial instrument to address liability concerns that have slowed the sales of COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries and emerging market economies. IDB President Mauricio Claver-Carone said the regional development bank created the new \"financial backstop\" after concerns voiced by many of its 26 borrowing members, including Argentina, Peru and Brazil. He told reporters the IDB was the first international financial institution to offer such partial credit guarantees for vaccine contracts, addressing companies' indemnification demands and removing a hurdle in pandemic response efforts. Latin America accounts for 8% of the world's population, but it has reported 27% of global COVID-19 deaths, he said. \"Essentially, it's a financial instrument that will provide guarantees for contingencies and liabilities, either with the countries or the pharmaceuticals,\" he said. \"This would help both the countries and the vaccine makers resolve the indemnity obligations - and therefore remove that key obstacle to the vaccine contract negotiations,\" he said. \"Hopefully this will help with the bilateral negotiations.\" Claver-Carone conceded the instrument was not \"a silver bullet\" and said the IDB, Latin America's main development lender, would continue work with borrowing countries on other vaccine issues, as well as helping them set up regulatory frameworks. Argentina and other countries in Latin America have raised concerns about what Claver-Carone called \"more and more onerous\" contractual demands made by pharmaceutical companies in their negotiations for the sale of COVID-19 vaccines. \"It could very well be a game-changer,\" he said, referring to the bank's decision to offer partial credit guarantees. \"We really think that this can break ... the most significant bottleneck that exists for their negotiations.\" He said the bank had been working closely with Argentina, El Salvador, Belize, the Bahamas, Panama, Ecuador, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Dominican Republic on vaccine concerns since announcing $1 billion in additional funding for the purchase and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in December. Claver-Carone, who became the bank's first U.S. president in October, also welcomed legislation introduced by U.S. senators that would boost the bank's capitalization to $20 billion from $12 billion. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and professor at Columbia University, dismissed the liability issue as \"a red herring,\" saying that most countries had taken on the liability issues. Claver-Carone pushed back against that characterization, saying the issue featured in his bilateral talks with all 26 borrowing members in recent weeks. He said the new instrument could ensure repayments over decades if the credit guarantees were triggered, and the IDB could also use some of the $1 billion it had set aside for the vaccine drive.

        "title": "Mexican court blocks law favoring state electricity plants",
        "full article": "MEXICO CITY (AP) - Even sooner than critics had expected, a court in Mexico issued an injunction Thursday to block a new law that favors government-owned power generation over cleaner private electrical plants. The law went into effect Tuesday, and within two days the court granted an injunction to block it. The ruling was sought by a company that operates a 160-megawatt wind farm in the southern Pacific coast state of Oaxaca. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has said the law is meant protect government-owned fossil-fuel plants against what he call unfair competition from private wind, solar and natural gas-fired power plants. But investors, many of them foreign, say it violates the U.S.-Mexico Canada free trade pact and Mexico\u00b4s commitments to cut carbon emissions. They claim it also creates a de-facto government monopoly, hurts competition and will make Mexicans buy dirtier, more expensive electricity. \"There is a societal and public interest in suspending the law,\" the Second Administrative District Court wrote in the ruling. It said the action aims to protect \"the continuity of public policies\" that were enacted in 2013 \"to promote sustainable development, competition in the electrical sector and protect the environment.\" Many wind, solar and gas-fired power stations were built in Mexico by foreign companies following the previous administration's energy reform that L\u00f3pez Obrador opposed. The president is a string supporter of state-owned enterprises and fossils fuels. The new law says electricity must first be bought from government-owned generating plants, which largely run on fossil fuels like coal, oil and diesel. If any demand remains, power will be purchased from renewable and private natural gas-fired plants. The bill has drawn complaints from private business groups and U.S. investors, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce saying in February the law \"would directly contravene Mexico\u00b4s commitments\" under the trade agreement, known as the USMCA, which places strict limits on how much a government can favor its own firms over outsiders. L\u00f3pez Obrador wants to defend state-owned firms and argues that Mexico should become energy self-sufficient, a conviction he says was strengthened after winter storms in Texas temporarily cut off supplies of imported natural gas early this year. With electricity use down during the pandemic, Mexico\u00b4s state-owned power company, the Federal Electricity Commission, faces declining revenue and increasing stocks of fuel oil it has to burn in power plants, though the dirty fuel has lost customers worldwide. The commission also has come under pressure to buy coal from domestic mines. The commission announced Thursday it would seek bids for construction of six new gas-fired power plants totaling about 4.3 megawatts, which it said were intended to improve the country's energy security.",

        "full article": "A man stands next to flaming tires at a make-shift roadblock set up by anti-government demonstrators in Beirut in a protest against dire economic conditions and a political impasse  France and the United States hit out at Lebanon's warring politicians on Thursday, with Paris saying they were failing to help the country as it slid towards \"total collapse\". \"It's tempting to say it is a case of non-assistance to a country in danger by Lebanese politicians,\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a news conference. \"Everyone knows what needs to be done.\" France has taken a leading role in trying to break the political deadlock in its former protectorate, with President Emmanuel Macron visiting the country twice last year. Lebanon's deeply divided political class has failed to agree on a new cabinet since a massive explosion in Beirut port last August that killed more than 200 people and led to the government's resignation. Le Drian said \"nothing has happened\" since Macron's visits when he pushed a plan for the political parties to form a non-sectarian government of experts which would be tasked with carrying out economic reforms and tackling corruption. \"I do believe that it is still not too late, but we're running out of time before total collapse,\" the French minister added. The US supported Le Drian's statement, saying that Lebanon's leaders have shown \"inaction in the face of multiple ongoing crises\". \"The Lebanese people -- we believe they deserve a government that will urgently implement the necessary reforms to rescue the country's deteriorating economy,\" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in Washington. \"Lebanon's political leaders need to put aside their partisan brinksmanship, they need to change course, they need to work for the common good and common interest of the Lebanese people,\" he said. Lebanon is mired in protests and an economic crisis, which has brought surging unemployment and spiralling prices while the currency has plunged to lows to the dollar on the black market. French officials have repeatedly voiced their exasperation at what they see as Lebanese politicians failing to put the interests of the country before their own.",

        "title": "Art world rocked as digital 'NFT' work fetches $69.3 mn",
        "full article": "\"Everydays\" -- a unique virtual-only work by US artist Beeple -- sold for $69.3 million at auction  A digital collage by American artist Beeple sold Thursday for a record $69.3 million at Christie's auctioneers, as virtual art rapidly establishes itself as a new -- and highly profitable -- creative genre. \"Everydays: The First 5,000 Days\" became the most expensive ever \"non-fungible token\" (NFT) -- a collectible digital asset that uses blockchain technology to turn virtual work into a unique item. Christie's said Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, is now among the top three most valuable living artists in any medium alongside Jeff Koons and David Hockney. The 39-year-old artist said that his work, on a JPEG, had \"as much craft, message, nuance and intent as anything made on a physical canvas.\" \"Artists have been using hardware and software to create artwork and distribute it on the internet for the last 20+ years but there was never a real way to truly own and collect it. With NFTs that has now changed,\" he added. \"I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the next chapter in art history.\" \"Everydays\" was the first purely digital NFT work of art to go under the hammer at a major auction house. Its buyer has not been publicly identified. The collage is based on a project beginning on May 1, 2007, when Beeple was a bored web designer and started to create a work of art each day, without interruption, to improve his drawing and graphic design. After 5,000 consecutive days, \"Everydays\" brought together his daily pieces in digital form, beginning with a simple image of his Uncle Jim and ending on a detailed graphic portrait of characters from Donald Trump to Buzz Lightyear to Michael Jackson, depicted as dystopian muses around a child drawing. - Millions watch auction - Since 2007, Beeple has accumulated nearly two million Instagram followers and collaborated with major brands and famous musicians, attracted by his imaginative graphic universe. But he had never sold any work under his own name until recently, when the new technology catapulted him into orbit as one of the most fashionable artists in the world. NFTs have a documented provenance that cannot be altered, guaranteeing authenticity and making the work ownable -- in contrast to most material on the internet where content is easily duplicated.          Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, is now among the top three most valuable living artists in any medium alongside Jeff Koons\u00a0and David Hockney  \"Beeple's success is a testament to the exciting possibilities ahead for this nascent marketplace. Today's result is a clarion call to all digital artists. Your work has value,\" said Noah Davis, a contemporary art specialist at Christie's. The auction house said a record 22 million people watched the dramatic final minutes of the two-week sale as the price rocketed among competing bidders from 11 countries. Nearly all of those who actively participated in the auction (91 percent) had never done so before, Christie's said. More than half of them were between the ages of 25 and 40. Todd Levin, a New York art adviser, told The New York Times that he had mixed emotions about the sale. \"On the one hand, it's super exciting to witness a historical inflection point,\" Levin said. \"On the other hand, the amount of money involved could skew and damage a nascent emerging market.\" At the end of February another of Beeple's works, \"Crossroads,\" was resold for $6.6 million on the platform Nifty Gateway, which specializes in virtual works. Beeple, from Charleston, South Carolina, received a 10 percent cut. And an animation that he himself had sold at the end of October last year for a symbolic dollar was recently acquired for $150,000. Though bewildering to many, a manic appetite for virtual objects authenticated through blockchain technology has spread through different markets. Twitter boss Jack Dorsey is selling his first tweet, from back in 2006, which reads \"just setting up my twttr,\" at an ongoing auction, with bidding reaching $2.5 million. Dramatic \"moments\" from National Basketball Association games have also become collectable items as non-fungible tokens -- despite remaining freely viewable online. A 10-second clip showing a spectacular sequence by superstar LeBron James fetched $208,000 on the NBA Top Shot site last month. tu-mdo-bgs-cat/sst/acb",

        "title": "Shaken by pandemic, soccer avoids financial collapse",
        "full article": "LIVERPOOL, England (AP) - Wandering around the concourses of the third tier of Anfield\u00b4s main stand provides a glimpse into the past. To the last day of normality in English soccer, before the world changed. One year later, the betting boards are still filled with the odds for Liverpool\u00b4s Champions League meeting with Atletico Madrid. That game, on March 11, 2020, was the last time an English stadium had a capacity crowd. That same day, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. On the one-year anniversary, most games around Europe were still being played in empty stadiums. But after an initial total shutdown of soccer and fears that clubs may go bankrupt because of the loss of ticket revenues, the sport seems to have emerged largely intact. And with vaccine rollouts gathering pace across Europe, there is hope that fans will soon be back in the stands. \"We are no longer in full crisis,\" Andrea Agnelli, the Juventus chairman who leads the European Club Association, said this week.          Chelsea's Mason Mount, third from left, scores his side's opening goal during the English Premier League soccer match between Liverpool and Chelsea at Anfield stadium in Liverpool, England, Thursday, March 4, 2021. (Phil Noble, Pool via AP)  But it's been a year where soccer became directly intermingled in the politics of trying to control the spread of the coronavirus. The British government initially ruled out any restrictions on sports events, and the Liverpool-Atletico game went ahead with a capacity crowd of 52,267 fans. At that time, Spanish authorities had already imposed a ban on events in Madrid with more than 1,000 people. In the end it was the Premier League itself that decided to pause for 100 days after prominent infections at Arsenal and Chelsea. In France, the domestic league was abandoned entirely on government orders, while the other major leagues also took long breaks. The 2020 European Championship was postponed until 2021, as was the Copa America in South America. The Champions League wasn't completed until August in empty stadiums in Lisbon. After the initial lockdown, fans were briefly allowed to return in pockets of Europe -- Liverpool was allowed up to 2,000 supporters in December at Anfield - but the second wave of infections and the spread of new variants sparked new lockdowns. \"Especially at Liverpool we missed (the fans) because we have the most special atmosphere probably in the world of football,\" Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp said this week. \"So it\u00b4s clear it makes a massive difference.\" At least there was no second complete shutdown of soccer in Europe, which helped prevent the financial apocalypse feared at the start of the pandemic. But there has been a significant impact caused by the loss of matchday and commercial revenue, and rebates owed to broadcasters due to the disruptions to the schedule. Accountancy firm KPMG assessed the finances of 43 clubs in Europe and found that total revenue dropped 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) - or 13% - last season. Agnelli, the ECA head, warned in January that European football teams face losing up to $10 billion due the pandemic. Juventus has already revealed that losses more than doubled year-on-year to 113 million euros in the final six months of 2020. The Italian champion was among leading clubs to convince players to waive parts of their salaries. Arsenal and Barcelona also got their millionaire stars to accept pay cuts. Barcelona has still been one of the clubs hardest hit as the pandemic compounded its existing financial problems. The Catalan club currently has debts over 1 billion euros. The Premier League fears clubs are losing 100 million pounds ($140 million) a month as long as the turnstiles remain locked. The impact of the pandemic was noticeable in the January transfer window when spending across England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France dropped from almost 1 billion euros in 2020 to around 275 million euros this year. \"I don\u00b4t think the market will ever go back to where it was because the business models were sometimes too stretched,\" said Andrea Sartori, KPMG\u00b4s global head of sports. \"So I think the crisis has helped rethink the overall business model of football because it\u00b4s hard to operate in an industry where many, many clubs are operating in a cost to revenue ratio which is well in excess of 65% like Barcelona.\" Postponing Euro 2020 has already cost UEFA hundreds of millions of euros. That's why the governing body is determined to have stadiums at least half-full when the tournament goes ahead across the continent in June and July. The lingering financial damage caused by pandemic to the wider economy is also felt by soccer clubs, as it could have an impact on sponsorship deals and broadcasting revenue. The Premier League is in the midst of auctioning TV rights to the world\u00b4s richest soccer competition and could be in for a shock. \"There\u00b4s certainly going to be a rights correction and it may be seen and interpreted by many as rights deflation,\" said Simon Green, the head of BT Sport, which airs Premier League games in England. But the overall outlook is a lot more optimistic than it was when soccer was largely shut down across the continent, and no one knew for sure when it might resume. \"We are now starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,\" La Liga President Javier Tebas said. \"In spite of loss of income of 2 billion euros, it could have been 7 billion euros. Especially the large clubs have been able to cope throughout this crisis.\" ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          Atletico Madrid's Kieran Trippier attempts a shot at goal in front of Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold during a second leg, round of 16, Champions League soccer match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid at a packed Anfield stadium in Liverpool, England, Wednesday, March 11, 2020.

        "title": "Jenrick `calls in\u00b4 controversial plan for new coal mine",
        "full article": "Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has decided to \u201ccall in\u201d a controversial application for a new coal mine near Whitehaven, his department has announced. In a letter to Cumbria County Council, the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said Mr Jenrick believed the application had raised issues of \u201cmore than local importance\u201d. It said that he had decided that a public inquiry should be held to explore the arguments put forward by both supporters and opponents of the proposal by West Cumbria Mining. \u201cThere are occasions when it is appropriate for Secretary of State to use his call-in powers, and he considers that this application should be called in for his own determination,\u201d the letter said. The announcement was welcomed by the environment campaigners, who warned that it would have undermined the Government\u2019s green credentials as it prepared to host the Cop26 international climate change summit in Glasgow later this year. Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said it was \u201ca startling, but very welcome U-turn by the Government\u201d. He added: \u201cPlanning permission must be refused: ending coal use, whether for power generation or for industry, is crucial for facing down the climate emergency. \u201cIt was not possible for the Government to maintain, as it claimed only two months ago, that this was just a matter of local importance and the decision will now rightly be taken at national level.\u201d The announcement came after the council said last month it would reconsider the application by West Cumbria Mining to mine for coking coal for use in steel production. The move prompted the company to\u00a0 declare last week that it was lodging papers with the High Court to commence judicial review proceedings. In its letter, the MHCLG noted the application had first been submitted in 2017 and had already been considered three times by the council\u2019s planning committee without it reaching a final outcome. It said that in taking his decision, Mr Jenrick had taken into account the latest recommendations of the Climate Change Committee for the sixth carbon budget which will set legal limits for emissions between 2033 and 2037. \u201cThe Secretary of State recognises that proponents and opponents take different positions on that matter, and considers that this should be explored during a public inquiry. Furthermore controversy about the application has increased,\u201d the letter said. \u201cOverall the Secretary of State considers that this application raises planning issues of more than local importance, and further considers that the limbs of the call-in policy relating to potential conflict with national policies \u2026 and substantial cross-boundary or national controversy are satisfied.\u201d For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said ministers had been forced to act following months of pressure. \u201cThe truth is that this mine is terrible for our\u00a0fight against climate change, won\u2019t help our steel industry and won\u2019t create secure jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe saga of this mine is a symptom of a Government that isn\u2019t serious about its climate ambitions and refuses to invest at scale in a green future to provide the jobs that workers have a right to expect.\u201d Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Tim Farron said allowing the mine to go ahead would be would be \u201can almighty backwards step\u201d in the fight against climate change. \u201cIn the year that Britain hosts Cop26, it is blindingly obvious that we won\u2019t be taken seriously on the world stage with this coal mine hanging round our neck. I hope this public inquiry leads to these plans finally being axed,\u201d he said. Greenpeace UK\u2019s chief scientist Doug Parr said it should never have taken ministers so long to act as the case for the mine was \u201cuntenable from the start\u201d. He said: \u201cThe Government may have just about saved its blushes, so long as the mine is canned. \u201cBut with plans still to expand airports and a green homes programme left in ruins, there\u2019s a long way to go before Boris Johnson can truly have the full credibility required of a man hosting vital climate talks later this year.\u201d",

        "title": "Blues start toughest stretch of season vs. Golden Knights",
        "full article": "The St. Louis Blues will begin the toughest portion of their schedule when they host the Vegas Golden Knights on Friday. The Blues play 21 of their remaining 30 games against their top three West Division rivals: the first-place Golden Knights, third-place Minnesota Wild and fourth-place Colorado Avalanche. After winning six consecutive games, the Golden Knights lost two games in Minnesota this week. Meanwhile the Blues went 4-0-2 during a six-game West Coast road trip. \"We've battled hard to this point, but you all know that our toughest games are yet to come with playing a lot of Colorado and Vegas and Minnesota, teams we haven't really played a whole lot,\" Blues forward Brayden Schenn said. \"But at the same time, we're getting ready to get some bodies back, get some of our star players back.\" The Blues are missing key forwards Jaden Schwartz, Robert Thomas, Tyler Bozak and Ivan Barbashev due to long-term injuries. Also missing are top defensemen Colton Parayko (upper-body injury) and Carl Gunnarsson, who suffered a season-ending knee injury. But winger Vladimir Tarasenko, who has scored 33 or more goals five times in his career, has returned from offseason shoulder surgery. He has one assist in his first two games in the lineup. \"It's so nice to have him back,\" Blues center Ryan O'Reilly said. \"How smart he is. The areas (where) he goes. I find when I get that puck, he's always back to this area. When he goes there, sometimes he draws a couple guys to him because he's that good of a scorer.\" Blues third-line center Oskar Sundqvist could return to the lineup for these back-to-back games against Vegas at Enterprise Center. He missed the last two games with an undisclosed injury, but he practiced Thursday. Meanwhile the Golden Knights will be without defenseman Alex Pietrangelo, the former Blues captain who was looking to play his first game back in St. Louis after exiting as a free agent. Pietrangelo suffered an upper-body injury Saturday while blocking a shot. \"Not a great sign that he returned home for evaluation,\" Golden Knights coach Peter DeBoer said. \"I'm not concerned it's long long-term, but he's out for the foreseeable future.\" The Knights will be looking to clean up their game after suffering the two losses in St. Paul. \"We didn't break the puck out well; we didn't transition the puck well,\" Vegas captain Mark Stone said after Wednesday night's 4-3 loss to the Wild. \"We didn't make proper plays in the (offensive) zone. We just didn't get any sustained zone time. To be honest, our execution was trash.\" The Blues are likely to start Jordan Binnington in goal, even though he is 1-3-1 with a no-decision in his last six starts. The Golden Knights are likely to counter with Marc-Andre Fleury, who was pulled for rookie Logan Thompson during the third period Wednesday. The Golden Knights sent goaltender Robin Lehner to the AHL's Henderson Silver Knights on a conditioning assignment, so he is close to returning from his upper-body injury. --Field Level Media",

        "title": "U.S. Postmaster acknowledges 'extreme delays' in some mail, says USPS needs big changes",
        "full article": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told lawmakers on Thursday that there are still \"extreme delays\" in some mail deliveries and that a 10-year strategic plan will revise existing service standards. DeJoy also informed lawmakers in a letter seen by Reuters that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) needs about $8 billion to electrify its forthcoming delivery vehicles fleet to the \"maximum extent\" feasible. The letter said that as many as 12,500 postal routes \"make electric vehicles unfeasible or impractical.\" With the \"right level of congressional support,\" DeJoy said he could commit \"to a majority of the Postal Service's delivery fleet being electric within 10 years.\" In February, electric-vehicle maker Workhorse Group Inc lost out when USPS awarded a $482 million contract to Oshkosh Defense to finalize production for the next-generation postal vehicles. Last month, DeJoy said USPS was committed to having EVs make up at least 10% of its new fleet. The USPS faces a $160 billion projected loss over the next decade and is looking to cut costs as it faces shrinking first-class mail volumes, DeJoy told a hearing of the House of Representatives Appropriations subcommittee. The reorganization would keep existing six-day delivery and would not close rural or small post offices. But he acknowledged service standards will be relaxed as part of the plan. The current standards are \"not achievable,\" DeJoy said. \"We cannot go to California from New York in three days without going on planes and we don't own planes.\" Last week, USPS said it was offering early retirement to thousands of non-union employees as it consolidates postal districts in an effort to stem billions in red ink. The USPS faces shrinking volumes of first-class mail, increased costs of employee compensation and benefits, and higher unfunded liabilities. It reported net losses of $86.7 billion from 2007 through 2020. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating that it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree health care and pension liabilities, a requirement labor unions have called an unfair burden not shared by other businesses. Draft House legislation in circulation includes eliminating a requirement to pre-fund retiree health benefits and have employees enroll in government-retiree health plan Medicare for a saving of $40 billion to $50 billion over 10 years.

        "title": "Hendrick off to fast start with 2 wins heading into Phoenix",
        "full article": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Hendrick Motorsports celebrates each race win with a Victory Bell t hat is carted across the campus for every employee to ring. If not for the pandemic, the bell would have made two trips so far this season. The Hendrick folks believe the count should actually be at four. Hendrick Motorsports is off to a blazing start this season with two wins through NASCAR's first four races, a marked uptick for an organization that went deep into the schedule the last few years before its program found a rhythm. William Byron and Kyle Larson have Hendrick on a two-race streak heading into this weekend's race at Phoenix Raceway, where Chase Elliott won in November to clinch his first Cup Series championship. Elliott and Alex Bowman are winless through the first month, but Bowman won the pole for the Daytona 500 and Elliott, a week after a runner-up finish in that marquee event, had the field covered at Daytona's road course until a questionable caution jumbled the race. \"I mean, certainly the Hendrick guys have come to play,\" said Kyle Busch, a former Hendrick driver who has since won two Cup championships with Joe Gibbs Racing.          Kyle Larson does a burnout after winning a NASCAR Cup Series auto race Sunday, March 7, 2021, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)  The momentum is a carryover from last season when Elliott gave Rick Hendrick his first title since Jimmie Johnson won it in 2016. The team had failed to advance a driver into the championship round in the three years between titles, a stretch that included an embarrassing 2018 season in which Elliott accounted for the only three wins for the entire organization. The slow rebuild has focused on behind-the-scenes reorganizations and improving performance on 1.5-mile tracks. Hendrick Motorsports trailed its rivals in nearly every statistical category, including victories, at those tracks last season. But after two stops at the bread-and-butter NASCAR circuits, Hendrick Motorsports is undefeated on intermediate tracks. NASCAR this year has diversified the schedule but there are still two 1.5-mile tracks in the third round of the playoffs, where a win earns an automatic berth into the championship finale. \"We've delved in pretty deep as a group to try to get our collective knowledge base higher,\" said Chad Knaus, who moved this year to vice president of competition at Hendrick after nearly two decades as a crew chief. \"Each team has its own identity, for sure, and the leeway to do whatever it is that they need to do, but they really collectively work together.\" Knaus even suggested that winning seven championships with Johnson might have precipitated the lean years. Johnson went winless his final three seasons and the Hendrick organization needed significant time to adapt to the new Camaro introduced by Chevrolet in 2018 and then again in 2020. The team has now had a full season with the new Camaro but Hendrick is also not following the lead of one team. \"Sometimes if you get somebody in there who is too overpowering, or maybe even too successful, they can lead the group in the wrong direction,\" Knaus said. \"The success that Jimmie and I had for years, it ruined a lot of advancement at Hendrick Motorsports. We won races that we maybe shouldn't have and what happens is a driver and a crew chief say `Well, let\u00b4s just do it like the 48.' That's not always the healthiest thing.\" This quick start has given Hendrick 265 victories, just three short of the record held by Petty Enterprises. The boss isn't celebrating just yet. \"I think you build momentum slowly in this sport,\" Hendrick said. \"We've still got work to do. We've got work to do in the pits. But we've got good speed. I just feel like the chemistry is so good right now. I don\u00b4t know if I ever remember it being any better across the board with all four cars.\" ___ More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          FILE - In this Feb. 10, 2019, file photo, team owner Rick Hendrick laughs on pit road during qualifying for the Daytona 500 auto race at Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Fla.

        "title": "Oklahoma killer's conviction overturned based on McGirt",
        "full article": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - An Oklahoma man\u00b4s murder convictions and death sentence have been overturned following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that much of eastern Oklahoma remains an American Indian reservation. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals on Thursday reversed the decisions against Shaun Bosse, 38, because the crimes occurred on land within the Chickasaw Nation's historic reservation and the victims were Native American. Bosse was convicted and sentenced to death in the 2010 killings of Katrina Griffin and her two young children. The victims were found inside a burning mobile home near Dibble, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City. In a ruling last year known as the McGirt decision, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Oklahoma prosecutors lack the authority to pursue criminal charges for crimes committed on tribal reservations in which the defendants or the victims are tribal citizens. \"We're grateful to the Court of Criminal Appeals for considering our arguments as seriously as they did,\" said Bosse's attorney, Michael Leiberman. \"He's relieved to know his death sentence will be vacated.\" Bosse's case could now be retried in federal criminal court.          FILE - In this undated file photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections is Shaun Michael Bosse of Oklahoma. Bosse's murder convictions and death sentence were overturned Thursday, March 11, 2021, by a state court based on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that much of eastern Oklahoma remains an American Indian reservation. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction and sentence of Bosse, 38, because the crime occurred on land within the Chickasaw Nation's historic reservation and the victims were Native American. (Oklahoma Department of Corrections via AP, File)  Although federal prosecutors have the authority to pursue the death penalty under certain circumstances, if the killing is determined to have occurred on tribal lands, the tribal nation must also agree to allow the death penalty. While some Oklahoma-based tribes have indicated they\u00b4re considering that option, only one tribe - the Sac & Fox Nation of Oklahoma - has explicitly authorized the death penalty in federal cases. In a separate case involving a Native American defendant, the state appeals court overturned the weapons and kidnapping convictions for a crime that took place within the historic boundaries of the Cherokee Nation. The court also rejected Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter's request that the court find the state has concurrent jurisdiction with federal and tribal governments. Hunter, state Senate Pro Tem Greg Treat and House Speaker Charles McCall called for Congress to allow the tribal nations to enter compacts with the state on criminal matters. \"We have successfully compacted on important issues, but compacting on criminal jurisdiction requires federal legislation first,\" they said in a joint statement. \"Crimes are being committed every day on lands now recognized to be reservations, and today\u00b4s decisions only place greater burdens on federal resources that are already stretched.\" Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said he would support a criminal jurisdiction compact with state and federal prosecutors. \"We continue to believe that Congress must authorize compacting that preserves 100% of McGirt and give tribes and the state increased flexibility and the option to cooperate to a greater degree on criminal matters,\" Hoskin said. Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby said he also would support such compacts and has been in contact with the U.S. Attorneys Office regarding Bosse's case. \"We are in communication with the United States Attorney and appreciate his assurance that federal charges will be timely filed\" against Bosse, Anoatubby said. \"We will continue our efforts to see justice done for the victim\u00b4s family.\" Acting U.S. Attorney Robert Troester said his office had been preparing for the ruling. \"Since last year\u00b4s Supreme Court decision in McGirt, we have been working closely with our tribal, federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to prepare for today\u00b4s decision and to protect those living within the boundaries of the Chickasaw Nation,\" Troester said in a statement.",

He was the chief executive of BHP from 2013 to 2019, and also spent 22 years at Shell rival BP.His time at BHP was overshadowed by a deadly dam collapse at an iron ore mine in Brazil \u2013 the country's worst ever mining disaster.An iron mine run by BHP and Brazil's Vale had been dumping its liquid waste behind a dam.When the dam eventually burst, it released more than 40m cubic metres of sludge, knocking down most of the village of Bento Rodrigues, killing 19 people, and destroying local wildlife.Mackenzie will also be taking over at a time when Shell is perceived to be behind BP in its plans for the energy transition.         Green target: Shell is aiming to reach net zero - meaning it will balance out any emissions it produces - by 2050The company is aiming to reach net zero \u2013 meaning it will balance out any emissions it produces \u2013 by 2050. But there has been discord within Shell over its strategy \u2013 and in late 2020 a slew of executives at its clean energy division all left the group.\u00a0In a statement, the company said: 'Andrew brings to Shell his experience of leadership, his global outlook, and a deep understanding of the energy business and climate action.'\u00a0But others were more critical. Mark van Baal, the founder of environmental activist shareholder group Follow This, said the appointment was 'a kind of insult to responsible investors who are increasingly voting for change'.Follow This has spent years campaigning for Shell to crack down on its emissions and tabled resolutions on the issue at its annual meetings.Van Baal said: 'This is a very bad signal to responsible investors who increasingly ask for the company to embark on the energy transition away from fossil fuels to renewables.   'I think institutional investors who are serious about climate change will not like this.'Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said Mackenzie would need to prove his critics wrong.He said: 'As chairman he'll be more of a mouthpiece than rolling his sleeves up. But that being said, he's got this incredible experience, there's little doubt in his CV, and there'll be a lot of crossover in terms of experience.'Shell's other main priority is recovering from the blow dealt by the pandemic, which sent it nosediving to a \u00a315.6billion loss last year and forced it to cut its prize dividend by two-thirds.The oil major will be aided by rising oil prices \u2013 which had crashed as the use of car and jet fuels slumped during lockdown but are now back at pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0Documents filed by Shell yesterday showed chief executive Ben van Beurden's pay packet fell by 42 per cent to \u00a35million after 2020's dire performance.

        "full article": "March 11 (Reuters) - Referee Darren Drysdale has been handed a back-dated suspension after confronting Ipswich Town midfielder Alan Judge on the pitch last month and is free to officiate again, the FA said on Thursday. Drysdale, 49, locked heads with Judge after the Ireland international's appeal for a penalty in a League One game against Northampton Town had been turned down. \"The match official admitted that his behaviour during the 90th minute of an EFL League One tie between Ipswich Town and Northampton Town on Tuesday 16 February 2021 amounted to improper conduct,\" the FA said in a statement. Drysdale, who apologised for the confrontation, told the FA's Regulatory Commission that he lost his cool when Judge shouted at him and said he was \"cheating\". \"I accept that I should not have moved my head towards Alan Judge as this only inflamed the situation. At no time was there any physical contact,\" he said. \"My action of moving forward was as a posture of authority and with the player being significantly shorter than me, this led to me looking down at him.\" The FA said the suspension ran from Feb. 19 to March 10 as Judge had been removed from refereeing EFL games in that period and it would have been a \"disproportionate penalty\" for him to serve suspension of another four games.

        "full article": "By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, March 11 (Reuters) - Brazil's real on Thursday rallied 2% against the dollar, boosted by another round of central bank intervention in the swaps market and inflation data that analysts said sets the seal on an interest rate increase next week. February's 5.2% annual inflation rate was higher than expected and well above the central bank's year-end target of 3.75%, cementing expectations it will raise its benchmark Selic lending rate by 50 basis points next week and adding fuel to the real's rally in recent days. The lower house of Congress also approved the basic text of a bill reviving federal cash transfers to help millions of poor families affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, removing some of the fiscal uncertainty that has weighed heavily on Brazil's currency. With global market sentiment also positive, the real jumped 2% to close at 5.54 per dollar. The currency is on course for its best week in more than three months. \"The market is pricing 50 basis points hike at the next meeting, followed by more hikes down the road,\" said Agustin Sicouly, head of Latin American currency trading at Barclays. \"It (higher rates) will give the currency some carry and yield,\" he said. The central bank's $1 billion sale of foreign exchange swaps followed two separate interventions on Wednesday, one a $1 billion sale of FX swaps and the other a $405 million spot market sale. The bank's FX swaps intervention this year now stands at $7 billion. It has also sold $5.58 billion in the FX spot market, all in the last few weeks. Sergio Goldenstein, strategist at OHMResearch and a former central bank director, believes inflation and fiscal risks have forced the central bank into taking an active policy of pushing the dollar lower. \"The central bank has finally decided to 'break' those long of the dollar, pushing it lower,\" he tweeted late on Wednesday. \"This puts long speculative or hedge dollar positions at risk, and attempts to avert or mitigate a negative spiral.\" (Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Paul Simao)",

        "title": "FOREX-Dollar at one-week low as optimism lifts riskier assets",
        "full article": "By John McCrank NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - The dollar fell to a one-week low on Thursday as the European Central Bank said it would keep a lid on borrowing costs and an auction of 30-year Treasury bonds was met with sufficient demand to help stabilize yields, giving a boost to riskier assets. The ECB said it was ready to accelerate money-printing to keep eurozone yields down, signaling to skeptical markets it was determined to lay the foundation for a solid economic recovery. In the United States, the response to the Treasury auction, which followed 3-year and 10-year auctions earlier in the week, helped allay concerns about investors' ability to absorb an increase in debt needed to finance the response to the pandemic. \"We've had a series of good news this week as far as the Treasury auctions are concerned and certainly the ECB delivered a little bit more than what we were expecting as far as being a little bit more dovish and try to up its purchases,\" said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities. \"It's a signal that we may be looking at a fairly significant tailwind behind risky asset prices.\" Investors had been concerned the auctions could go poorly after a weak seven-year sale last month helped to spark a dramatic sell-off in government debt prices. World equity markets surged, with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow indexes hitting all-time highs on Thursday, helped by a raft of positive news, as weekly jobless claims fell more than expected and U.S. President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law. The \"risk-on\" tone in the market was helped by soft U.S. consumer prices data on Wednesday that helped ease concerns about a possible spike in inflation as economies reopen from the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The market had probably got itself a little bit too oversensitive about rising runaway inflation - which there isn't yet,\" said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale. The safe-haven dollar was down 0.41% at 91.435 against a basket of currencies, its third-straight day of declines after touching a three-month high of 92.506 on Tuesday. The euro was around 0.44% higher against the dollar, at $1.19815. It is down around 2% this year. \"The European outlook has disappointed many people and the expectations for the eurozone are still beleaguered by COVID-19, and that's kind of preventing the euro from really taking off today,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at FX broker OANDA. Elsewhere, Australian and New Zealand dollars rose for the third session in a row, both at their highest in a week versus the U.S. dollar, helped by rising commodity prices . In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was up 2.6% at $57,300.83 . The digital currency has recovered from some recent losses but not surpassed its all-time high of $58,354.14, reached on Feb. 21.

        "full article": "By Simon Evans MANCHESTER, England, March 11 (Reuters) - A stoppage-time header from defender Simon Kjaer earned AC Milan a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in their Europa League last-16 first-leg match at Old Trafford on Thursday. Teenager Amad Diallo's 50th-minute goal had put United ahead before Kjaer angled in a fine header from Rade Krunic's corner in the final moments. The draw was justice for Stefano Pioli's Milan who had two goals ruled out in the opening 45 minutes as they opened up United with surprising ease. The 18-year-old Diallo, who joined United from Serie A club Atalanta in January, came on as a halftime substitute and claimed his first goal for the English side five minutes later. The Ivorian winger used clever movement to get behind the Milan defence, was picked out by a lofted ball from Bruno Fernandes and found the target with a smart back-header over Milan keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. United had been fortunate to go in level at the break. Rafael Leao had a fifth-minute effort ruled out for offside and then were very lucky when a Franck Kessie strike was ruled out for a questionable handball call by VAR. United keeper Dean Henderson had to make several saves but the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side should have gone ahead in the 39th minute when Harry Maguire somehow hit the post from point-blank range at the back post. Dan James missed another sitter after United had gone in front, turning Mason Greenwood's cross wide when unmarked and five metres out. Newly crowned Scottish champions Rangers fought back to earn a 1-1 draw at Slavia Prague. Romanian Nicolae Stanciu fired the Czech side ahead in the sixth minute with a superb strike but Steven Gerrard's side drew level through Filip Helander. The Scots had keeper Allan McGregor to thank, though, for his fine save in the final moments of the game from Lukas Masopust. Ajax Amsterdam will be confident of their place in the last eight after beating Switzerland's Young Boys 3-0 with second- half goals from Davy Klaassen, Dusan Tadic and Brian Brobbey. Spain's Villarreal enjoyed a 2-0 win at Dynamo Kyiv with Pau Torres poking home the opener on the half-hour mark, before Raul Albiol doubled the lead in the second half.

But when was the last time all 15 England starters hit top gear in the same match?It is a change of attitude and tempo I want to see and a radical tightening up of discipline \u2014 from Maro Itoje downwards.That is what cost them the game in Cardiff last time and I trust that defeat and the manner of it has been hurting and will inspire a backlash.England have had referee Wayne Barnes in this week to provide clarification in certain areas but discipline is down to the players and coaches. It is a determination to be in control while playing on the edge.       Saracens' Elliot Daly has been playing out of position at full back and has looked hesitantThe headline selection is, of course, Max Malins at full back and I welcome it both as a recognition of his talent and of the fact that Elliot Daly has not reached his usually high standards.Daly has been playing out of position at full back.\u00a0His best Test rugby has been on the wing and I would have loved to see him play at outside centre at some stage.\u00a0He is not an instinctive full back and has looked hesitant. That has affected his confidence and I suspect that, deep down, he might be relieved not to be starting at 15.Daly is a major talent and I hope that being dropped will remotivate him and see a return to his best. What he probably needs is a run of five or six games in a position of his choosing for Saracens.         Eddie Jones has picked a strong England team, capable of beating any side on their dayMalins is a real attacking threat and earlier this season it was a delight watching him look to the manner born in Pat Lam's star-studded Bristol back division. What a learning ground for a young, attack-minded full back.That was two months ago and he has played almost no rugby in the interim, which is not ideal \u2014 lack of rugby has affected the Sarries contingent.\u00a0But Malins' general confidence is high and at full back he does at least know he will be involved from the off, unlike Ollie Lawrence when he was brought in at 12 only to be by-passed in the games he started. Malins' inclusion will not be welcomed by Fabian Galthie and France.The result does not overly matter. It is more important that we see England flick a switch mentally and start showcasing their great talent and play at tempo \u2014 a tempo which was on show against Wales when, in bursts, they produced some of their best attacking rugby in a long while. Much more of that and we will really see how good this France team are.          RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       CHRIS FOY: Eddie Jones has rediscovered his daring streak by...

That should be the refereeing body's top priority, before they start wondering whether they can borrow NASA's Hubble Space Telescope for closer looks at tight offside calls.The average supporter can become baffled while watching his or her team in the Premier League. Sometimes a referee or VAR makes a call which leaves those at home saying, 'Eh?'Then Stockley Park scramble to release an explanation. Instead, let's hear what is said between the referee and his VAR in those key moments. They will still make the odd mistake.\u00a0         Erik Pieters seemed to handle the ball but no explanation was given for no penalty being given\u00a0They will still get told their interpretation was wrong and be bashed by keyboard warriors. But at least the average viewer would be able to understand how and why the officials came to a conclusion.That Erik Pieters handball against Arsenal \u2014 let's hear why referee Andre Marriner and VAR Kevin Friend didn't think it met the criteria for a penalty against Burnley. It happens in other sports. Why not the most popular sport of them all? Australian referee Jarred Gillett, who is VAR for Newcastle v Aston Villa on Friday night, wore a mic for his final A-League match Down Under. Look it up online. It worked perfectly.

It has done exactly what I feared it would do: slowed down the game, robbed us of spontaneity and presented us with a new set of problems to replace the old ones.\u00a0However, as we look to move forward, the most pressing matter is to change two important laws of the game.The offside law in its current form is a joke. The advantage has been taken from the attacking team and that is wrong. Similarly, handball has become less of a deliberate infringement and more of a way to punish unfortunate accidents.         VAR has slowed the game down and robbed fans of the spontaneity that brought joy\u00a0The only way to defend safely these days is to tie your arms behind your back. VAR is not to blame for these issues. In picking them up and bringing them to a referee's attention, VAR is actually doing its job perfectly.If we really want players to be called offside by the width of an armpit, then VAR is the only way to make that happen.\u00a0So before we start dismantling technology that so many people called for so loudly, let's look at the laws of the game. They are failing us.\u00a0 MIKE KEEGAN - Ditch it and give refs the powerVAR \u2014 a system overseen by humans \u2014 was brought in to eliminate human error. How does that work?It is not fit for purpose because it is fundamentally flawed. We are told it is there to rectify 'clear and obvious errors' and yet we have this ludicrous situation where the game is stopped, Stockley Park cannot make a decision and the referee is dragged over to watch the incident on a screen before making the call. A nonsense.         Fractional offside decisions are infuriating and not in the spirit of what the law intendedAnd what of VAR's impact on the offside rule? I am fairly certain that when, in 1863, the rule was brought in, it was to prevent goal-hanging \u2014 and not to stop someone scoring because their elbow was an inch beyond the defender's backside.The whole thing is a sorry, unnecessary mess.Keep goal-line technology, ditch VAR. Let's give power back to the referees \u2014 at least we can hold them accountable when they get it wrong.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       EXCLUSIVE: How do YOU want to fix this VAR mess?

        "full article": "AC Milan scored a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser to secure a 1-1 draw with Manchester United from the first leg of their Europa League last-16 clash at Old Trafford. United, missing Edinson Cavani and Marcus Rashford through injury, looked to have done enough for a slender victory after taking the lead through teenager Amad Diallo\u2019s header at the start of the second half. However, AC Milan made the Premier League side pay for not scoring a second goal when Simon Kjaer headed in from a corner. A disappointing end to the first leg of our last-16 tie.\ud83d\udd34 #MUFC\ud83c\udfc6 #UEL\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 11, 2021   The Italians thought they had taken an early lead when Rafael Leao broke clear to fire past Dean Henderson \u2013 but the forward was ruled offside. Milan had the ball in the net again in the 11th minute when Franck Kessie slotted in after a throw-in, but this time the goal was ruled out following a VAR review for handball in the build-up. Diallo replaced Anthony Martial for the second half \u2013 and the 18-year-old made an instant impact as he flicked home a quick free-kick from Bruno Fernandes to head United in front in the 50th minute. United, though, could not find a second goal, with Daniel James failing to turn in a ball across the six-yard box from Mason Greenwood. It proved costly as Milan forced a dramatic equaliser in stoppage time when defender Kjaer headed in. Newly-crowned Scottish champions Rangers battled back to earn a 1-1 draw away at Slavia Prague.

The Light Blues equalised 10 minutes before half-time when Filip Helander tapped the ball in from close range after a deep free-kick was knocked through the Slavia penalty area. Goalkeeper Allan McGregor produced a fine late save from Lukas Masopust to give Rangers every chance in the second leg at Ibrox. \ud83d\udcf8 Davy Klaassen celebrates putting Ajax ahead! \u274c\u274c\u274c#UEL pic.twitter.com/iDNcjvj9pw\u2014 UEFA Europa League (@EuropaLeague) March 11, 2021   Ajax beat Young Boys 3-0 to take control of their last-16 tie. Midfielder Davy Klaassen broke the deadlock just after the hour when he drilled in a 20-yard effort. Former Southampton frontman Dusan Tadic drilled in a second with eight minutes to go, and substitute Brian Brobbey beat the offside trap to score a third in stoppage time. Villarreal also look to have one foot in the quarter-finals after they won 2-0 at Dynamo Kiev, with some 12,750 fans at the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex.

The Premier League side went ahead in the 34th minute when on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Martin Odegaard fired a long-range effort past Olympiacos keeper Jose Sa for his first Arsenal goal. Olympiacos were gifted an equaliser just before the hour when Dani Ceballos was caught out trying to pass back to goalkeeper Bernd Leno and Youssef El-Arabi drilled the ball in from 20 yards. With 11 minutes left, defender Gabriel powered in a looping header following a short corner before substitute Mohamed Elneny crashed in a 25-yard effort off the inside of the far post. Tottenham warmed up for Sunday\u2019s north London derby with a 2-0 home win over Dinamo Zagreb. Spurs went ahead in the 25th minute when Harry Kane knocked home a rebound after Erik Lamela\u2019s shot came back off the post.

        "full article": "BERLIN (AP) - AC Milan defender Simon Kj\u00e6r scored in injury time Thursday to secure a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in the first leg of the Europa League\u00b4s round of 16. Kj\u00e6r capitalized on poor defending to head in a corner in the 92nd minute to give the Italian side a slight advantage ahead of the second leg next week. Roma, Tottenham, Arsenal and Ajax all put one foot into the quarterfinals with comfortable wins. But the meeting of two former European heavyweights remains evenly poised. United took the lead after 18-year-old substitute Amad Diallo scored his first European goal just five minutes after coming on. But the home team was disorganized for Rade Kruni\u00b4c\u00b4s late corner and goalkeeper Dean Henderson was unable to keep out Kj\u00e6r\u00b4s thumping header. \"We should have attacked the ball with the men we had there,\" United coach Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said. Milan had two early goals ruled out at Old Trafford. Rafael Le\u00e3o was offside in the fifth minute, while Franck Kessi\u00e9 displayed brilliant technique to score in the 11th only to see the goal chalked off through VAR as the ball had struck his arm.

(AP Photo/Dave Thompson)  The visitors remained in control until United captain Harry Maguire somehow struck the post from point-blank range with the goal at his mercy after Bruno Fernandes headed on a corner in the 38th. Fernandes was United\u00b4s key player, providing a lofted ball over the top for Amad to head in the opener in the 50th minute. KANE DELIVERS Harry Kane scored twice to put Tottenham in a commanding position with a 2-0 home win over Dinamo Zagreb. The England striker converted a rebound after Erik Lamela\u00b4s effort hit the post in the 25th, and wrapped up the win in the 70th. K\u00e9vin Th\u00e9ophile\u00ad-Catherine failed to deal with Serge Aurier\u00b4s cross leaving Kane to score with a low finish. ARSENAL COMFORTABLE Mohamed Elneny put Arsenal in touching distance of the quarterfinals by sealing a 3-1 win over Olympiakos in Greece. Martin \u00d8degaard opened the scoring with a thunderous long-range strike in the 34th but the visitors missed further chances in the first half. Youssef El-Arabi capitalized on poor pass from Arsenal `keeper Bernd Leno to equalize in the 58th. Gabriel restored the visitors\u00b4 lead in the 80th with a header, five minutes before Elneny made sure of the win when the home side failed to close him down and he let fly from outside the penalty area. FANS IN THE STANDS Spanish team Villarreal beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 in Ukraine despite several thousand vocal fans being allowed into the game. Gerard Moreno set up defender Pau Torres to score after the home team failed to clear a corner in the 30th minute, and was involved again for the second. Villarreal captain Ra\u00fal Albiol scored on the rebound in the 52nd after Georgiy Bushchan saved Gerard\u00b4s header. OTHER GAMES Stephan El Shaarawy scored his first goal for Roma since returning to the club in January, helping the Italian team to a 3-0 win over visiting Shakhtar Donetsk.

        "full article": "State governments will get a big influx of federal money from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that could suddenly enable them to undertake large, expensive projects that have long been on their to-do lists, including high-speed internet for rural areas and drinking water improvements. The aid plan, approved by Congress in close party-line votes and signed by President Joe Biden on Thursday, includes $195 billion for states, plus separate funds for local governments and schools. While the package contains considerable short-term financial relief for businesses and individuals who have suffered from the outbreak, its Democratic supporters also see it as a rich opportunity to help states attack poverty more broadly and accomplish the kind of big things government used to do. Since most state budgets are not in the tailspins that many feared last spring, states can use their share of the money to go way beyond balancing the books and dealing with the direct costs of the coronavirus pandemic. \"There are no words to describe the impact that has on a state that has long had extreme and persistent poverty,\" said New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat. \"This is exactly the investment that we have always deserved and that we need now more than ever.\" Even Republican governors who have argued against the plan are drawing up ambitious plans similar to what's on the wish lists of Democratic lawmakers and governors.

State governments will get a big influx of federal money from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that could suddenly enable them to undertake large, expensive projects that have long been on their to-do lists, including high-speed internet for rural areas and drinking water improvements. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)  In Democrat-controlled California, GOP-held Idaho, and Vermont, with a Republican governor and Democratic legislative majority, priorities include drinking water and rural broadband projects. In New Mexico, officials expect to use $600 million to pay off debts to the state\u00b4s unemployment fund - a move that would prevent a spike in payroll taxes for businesses - and still have more than $1 billion for projects such as economic development grants, road improvements and others still to be determined. While the behemoth CARES Act adopted last March included $150 billion for state, local and tribal governments, that help was restricted mostly to direct pandemic-related costs. The new package gives states much more flexibility. Republican governors are arguing that the economy is already in recovery and that all the spending will eventually need to be repaid by the taxpayers. They also object to a formula that distributes more money per capita to states with higher unemployment rates, which they see as penalizing them for keeping more of their economies open through the pandemic. \"Instead of using the bipartisan blueprint of previous federal coronavirus relief bills, this legislation is literally a wish list for California and New York,\" said Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. \"It\u00b4s a slap in the face for my fellow Georgians.\" The Republicans who control state government in Georgia are working on plans to cut taxes - something being pursued in other GOP-run states, including Arizona and Iowa. But that might run afoul of a provision in the relief package that bars the money from being used to pay for tax cuts. Around the country, it turns out that the state budget picture generally isn\u00b4t as bleak as it was expected to be. Last year's relief spending helped by sending money directly to governments, businesses and individuals. It helped keep workers on the payroll and paying taxes. Further, investors who supply much of the tax revenue in states like New York and California, which announced a $15 billion surplus in January, had a good year because of the soaring stock market. And the job losses from the pandemic were deepest among lower-wage workers, who account for a smaller portion of tax revenue. An analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes \"pro-growth\" policies, found that 28 states brought in less revenue in 2020 than 2019. The hardest-hit states included Florida, Hawaii, Nevada and Texas, which rely heavily on tourism and sales taxes. The amounts states are in line to receive from the COVID-19 relief package exceed the revenue declines in every state, though, and amount to more than 100 times the combined revenue loss, the group found. Even while objecting to the Democratic measure in general, Idaho Gov. Brad Little outlined some of the same priorities as his Democratic counterparts. \"We know the debt is mortgaged from our grandkids,\" he said, \"and I will push to use those funds to directly support them through long-range investments in education, broadband and water infrastructure.\" ___ Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

New Houston Texans coach David Culley reiterated Thursday, March 11, 2021, that the team has no intention of trading Watson, despite the star quarterback's request to be dealt. (AP Photo/Matt Patterson, File)  Watson, who led the NFL in yards passing last season, has been unhappy with the direction of the team for some time. He made his request to be traded not long after the season ended. Sports Illustrated reported in January that Watson was upset the Texans didn\u00b4t initially request to interview Kansas City offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy for their coaching vacancy. They eventually did interview Bieniemy before hiring Culley. O\u00b4Brien was fired after the Texans opened the season 0-4 and they finished 4-12 after winning the AFC South the previous two seasons. Culley said they do not have a contingency plan at quarterback if Watson decides to hold out if he isn\u00b4t traded. Asked if Watson was committed to him and the team, Culley replied: \"Yes, he is.\" When pushed about how he knows that, Culley didn\u00b4t provide any details indicating Watson has told him that. \"Well, he\u00b4s a Houston Texans,\" he said. \"And again... I feel like that with the commitment that we\u00b4ve made to him, I feel like that that same commitment will be there with us.\" The situation with Watson comes amid a time of unprecedented upheaval for the franchise. The Texans granted J.J. Watt\u00b4s request to be released last month with one year remaining on his contract. He recently signed with the Cardinals for two years, joining star receiver DeAndre Hopkins - who O\u00b4Brien traded before last season for very little return. Watson is in a different situation than Watt after signing a four-year, $156 million contract last year. Watson\u00b4s contract makes a trade more difficult because of the future dead money for Houston, which gave him a $27 million bonus that is prorated. Culley is in his first head coaching job after spending more than two decades as an NFL assistant. He seems undaunted by the uncertainty surrounding Watson and is looking forward to getting going with his new team. \"My enthusiasm has gone through the roof right now,\" he said. \"It\u00b4s gone up even more. If you saw me before then, you see me now and you hear me now, you see it\u00b4s gone through the roof, and it\u00b4s getting higher and higher every day as I get excited about this football team and where we\u00b4re headed.\" ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "full article": "ROME (AP) - A U.N. epidemiologist who publicly denounced the World Health Organization\u00b4s withdrawal of a report on Italy\u00b4s coronavirus response has resigned, citing the \"unsustainable situation\" he faced at the agency as a whistleblower. Francesco Zambon said Thursday his resignation was effective March 31. He declined further comment other than to say it was \"humanly and professionally\" impossible for him to continue on his job. Zambon had filed an internal ethics complaint with the WHO in May after he said he was pressured by a senior WHO official to falsify data to obscure that Italy hadn\u00b4t updated its influenza pandemic preparedness plan since 2006. Zambon refused, and the report eventually was published noting the outdated plan and saying Italy\u00b4s initial response to the outbreak was \"improvised, chaotic and creative.\" The WHO pulled the report from its website May 14, a day after it went up, and never republished it. The scandal over its withdrawal made headlines amid suggestions that the WHO spiked it to spare the Italian government criticism, embarrassment and liability. The WHO said it contained \"factual inaccuracies.\" The agency added that it had created other ways of evaluating countries\u00b4 responses.

Prosecutors are investigating whether to lay any criminal blame for Italy\u00b4s horrific coronavirus toll, whether a lack of preparedness contributed to it and whether even the 2006 plan was ever implemented. Zambon's resignation was first reported by state-run RAI's investigative Report program.",

        "full article": "By Siddharth Cavale March 11 (Reuters) - Clorox Co will be able to meet the feverish demand for its disinfectant wipes by summer, when it expects to produce 2 million canisters per day, the company's chief growth officer told Reuters on Thursday. It previously said it would meet consumer demand by the end of 2021. \"I use that 2 million mark to meet the longer term or at least in this fiscal year demand levels that we are seeing,\" said Tony Matta, who joined the company in October. Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, consumers have frantically stocked up on various cleaning supplies, leading to a shortage of Clorox disinfectant wipes among other items, despite the company's efforts to ramp up manufacturing. The company said it will start a second dedicated manufacturing line for wipes at its Atlanta production facility this quarter, after it had to push back the time frame for easing nationwide shortages several times over the past year. Last May, Clorox said it would meet demand for wipes by mid-summer, but then told Reuters it would take at least until 2021. Months later, on a post-earnings call in February, CFO Kevin Jacobsen revised the timeline again to the end of 2021. While the company continues to crank out wipes at its factories 24/7, transportation hurdles that have plagued the consumer packaged industry have hurt Clorox. \"We have incurred significant increases in costs for shipping, but those were costs we were willing to bear to improve the supply situation,\" Matta said. \"By summer, there should be much more normalcy around the kind of supply that consumers would have expected pre-pandemic when they go into stores.\" (Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "title": "At Air Force One base, intruder given up by 'mouse ears'",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - In a highly unusual breach of security last month at the air base that operates the Air Force One presidential aircraft, an apparently aimless intruder went undetected for several hours and walked on and off an airplane on the flight line before his quirky headgear gave him away. He was wearing what an Air Force investigative report released Thursday described as \"a bright red or pink cap that partially covered his ears and had distinctive balls on top that looked a little like mouse ears.\" An airman in the operations office at Joint Base Andrews, located in Maryland just outside Washington, saw the man on the flight line and became suspicious, partly because of the headgear, and called security. Officials said he never got close to Air Force One. \"To be frank, I'm just being honest, we had no idea we had an unauthorized civilian on the base. He could have roamed around for a lot longer had it not been for that particular airman that figured out he doesn't quite fit,\" said Sami Said, the Air Force inspector general who briefed reporters on his findings. The Feb. 4 intrusion was reported the same day by the Air Force, which opened an internal investigation to determine how it happened and what could be done to minimize chances of a repeat. The probe found three main security failings, starting with \"human error\" by a gate security guard who allowed the man to drive onto the base even though he had no credentials that authorized his access. Hours later, the man walked undetected onto the flight line by slipping through a fence designed to restrict entry. And, finally, he walked onto and off a parked airplane without being challenged, even though he was not wearing a required badge authorizing access to the restricted area. The day of the incident, the officials said the intruder was turned over to local law enforcement because there was at least one outstanding warrant for his arrest. His name has not been released. The inspector general\u00b4s report said he had \"an extensive arrest record,\" but further details were blacked out.          President Joe Biden waves as he and first lady Jill Biden board Air Force One at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base in Houston, Friday, Feb. 26, 2021. The Bidens are en route to Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)  \"Security forces actually never saw him transition from the open gate to the aircraft,\" said Said, the inspector general. Aside from his odd hat, the intruder's clothing - dark pants and jacket and black high-top sneakers - could have made him appear to be a contractor, Said said, although he should have been challenged anyway, not least because he had no visible badge authorizing his presence. \"The good news is, once alerted, security forces apprehended him pretty darned quickly - the minute he came off the plane,\" he said. Said said the modified Boeing 747 that serves as Air Force One for presidential travel was never at risk and that it is kept behind more layers of protection at Andrews. \"That area is exceptionally secure,\" he said. Unimpeded, the unarmed intruder got aboard a C-40, a transport jet primarily used by members of the Cabinet, Congress and military combatant commanders. He did no harm and the Air Force investigation report, which was heavily censored by the Air Force before it was released Thursday, concluded that he had no plan to cause harm to Air Force personnel or equipment. His purpose could not be definitively determined. \"The evidence supports the conclusion that (blank) was simply wandering around the base and did not enter the base to meet anyone,\" the report said. \"During questioning, (blank) said he came on base because he wanted to see airplanes.\" After driving through the Virginia Gate at Andrews, the man drove to the base exchange, where surveillance camera footage later showed he spent about an hour before returning to his car. His whereabouts for the next four hours could not be determined. Personnel at the 89th Air Wing passenger terminal recalled him entering the terminal, and he then slipped unnoticed onto the flight line through an 18-inch gap in a security fence gate that was not fully closed because of a \"malfunction.\" He walked onto the C-40 aircraft, which was open to facilitate a communications training session. Two aircrew members were aboard. The intruder walked to the back of the plane and left unchallenged after a few minutes. As he walked back toward the security gate on the flight line he was stopped and arrested. Said said that to his knowledge Andrews had never before experienced such a lapse in security.

The results of the first year, released last week, showed most people used the money to pay off debt and land full-time jobs.Tubbs was the subject of an HBO documentary and seemed destined for higher office one day. But the political world was shocked when Tubbs was not reelected in November, losing to Kevin Lincoln, a Republican and former Marine who like Tubbs had also returned to Stockton after a stint in Washington.

Tubbs said he had other opportunities, including a return to Washington. Instead he chose to stay in California and work with Newsom, who will likely face a recall election later this year fueled by anger over his handling of the pandemic.'This recall is utter nonsense. It's a distraction from the work that's been done,' Tubbs said, citing Newsom signing a bill to give $600 payments to Californians with low and moderate incomes and a program that has renovated hotel rooms for the homeless. 'I was really excited about sort of joining in the middle of a conversation about what type of California do we want to live in.'Tubbs said the job is unpaid because he needed flexibility to work on other projects. He has a memoir scheduled to be published later this year. And he's continuing to work with Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a group of 40 mayors advocating for guaranteed income programs. He said about six local programs are expected to be up and running by the end of summer.         Tubbs' stewardship of Stockton, Calif. was the subject of an HBO documentary last year titled Stockton On My MindA bill pending before the California Legislature would offer a guaranteed income to children who age out of the state's foster program. But Tubbs said his goal is to have the federal government adopt a guaranteed income program at a massive scale, which some estimates have pegged could cost nearly $3 trillion.'I think the data speaks for itself,' Tubbs said, adding he plans to work with cities to adopt smaller programs 'to really build the case.'As for his political future, Tubbs said he has always viewed politics 'as a means to an end,' saying he's not 'wedded to serving in political office.''I'm really motivated, not by position but by the mission of increasing opportunity for all Californians,' he said.",

They warned that the next few weeks are critical as the progress made in bringing the coronavirus under control in the province has stalled. \"Variants of concern continue to spread across Ontario. Our ability to control the rate of spread will determine whether we return to normal or face a third wave of infection,\" the panel said in briefing material. While mutations in viruses are inevitable, strains identified as \"variants of concern\" have worrisome changes that may give the virus advantages, increasing transmissibility or reducing the effectiveness of vaccines, according to the briefing materials released by the province's science advisory and modeling consensus tables. Graphs published online ahead of the briefing showed cases of the new variants in Ontario have jumped from below 5 per 100,000 residents each week in early February to nearly 20 per 100,000 residents each week in early March. That increase has been balanced to some extent by a decline in cases of earlier variants of the virus.

At 24-13 and No. 3 in the Western Conference, the Lakers hope to receive some good news with the eventual return of big man Anthony Davis sometime this month from a right calf strain that forced him to miss the last nine games. The Lakers have posted a 7-7 record with Davis out of the lineup for various nagging injuries so far this season. Los Angeles begins the second half of the season with eight of their next 11 games at home. At 16-19, the Pacers start the second half of the season with six of their next seven games on the road. Indiana is 9-8 on the road this year. Guard Malcolm Brogdon leads the Pacers in scoring, averaging 21.2 points per contest. All-Star Domantas Sabonis is having perhaps his best season as a pro, averaging 20.8 points, 11.1 rebounds and 6.0 assists a contest. Sabonis, who appeared in his second All-Star Game and won the skills competition during All-Star weekend, was pleased to get a few days off in preparation for the second half of the season. \"We have a tough stretch coming up as we start March,\" Sabonis said. \"We're all going to have to have everyone ready. Hopefully, we get some players back and that will give us some extra firepower.\" Guard T.J. McConnell has been a spark plug for the Pacers. McConnell averaged 9.4 points, 7.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds a contest over the last 15 games, including a triple-double (16 points, 13 assists, 10 steals) in Indiana's 114-111 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 3. \"I'm just trying to do anything that I can to help my team win,\" McConnell said after his triple-double performance. \"That was really my mindset.\" However, the Pacers have lost 10 of their last 15 games. --Field Level Media",

For some, the reason may be emotional value, because NFTs are seen as collectors items. For others, they are seen as an investment opportunity similar to cryptocurrencies, because the value could increase.\u00a0\u00a0When were NFTs created?\u00a0Writer and podcaster\u00a0Andrew Steinwold traced the origins of NFTs back to 2012, with the creation of the Colored Coins cryptocurrency. But NFTs didn't move into the mainstream until five years later, when the blockchain game CryptoKitties began selling virtual cats in 2017.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Advertisement\nIt also marks the first time a major auction house has offered a digital-only artwork with a non-fungible token as a guarantee of its authenticity, as well as the first-time cryptocurrency has been used to pay for an artwork at auction.The 255-year-old auction house had offered to accept payment in Ethereum.NFTs are electronic identifiers confirming a digital collectible is real by recording the details on a digital ledger known as a blockchain.\u00a0\u00a0They have a documented provenance that cannot be altered, guaranteeing authenticity and making the work ownable, in contrast to most material on the internet where content is easily duplicated.\u00a0\u00a0It has answered a question vital to digital ownership: how to claim ownership of something that can be easily and endlessly duplicated.The tokens have swept the online collecting world recently, an offshoot of the boom in cryptocurrencies.\u00a0'Beeple's success is a testament to the exciting possibilities ahead for this nascent marketplace. Today's result is a clarion call to all digital artists. Your work has value,' said Noah Davis, a contemporary art specialist at Christie's.The auction house said a record 22 million people watched the dramatic final minutes of the two-week sale as the price rocketed among competing bidders from 11 countries.Todd Levin, a New York art adviser, told The New York Times that he had mixed emotions about the sale.'On the one hand, it's super exciting to witness a historical inflection point,' Levin said. 'On the other hand, the amount of money involved could skew and damage a nascent emerging market.'At the end of February another of Beeple's works, 'Crossroads,' was resold for $6.6 million on the platform Nifty Gateway, which specializes in virtual works. Beeple, from Charleston, received a 10 percent cut.And an animation that he himself had sold at the end of October last year for a symbolic dollar was recently acquired for $150,000.Though bewildering to many, a manic appetite for virtual objects authenticated through blockchain technology has spread through different markets.Twitter boss Jack Dorsey is selling his first tweet, from back in 2006, which reads 'just setting up my twttr,' at an ongoing auction, with bidding reaching $2.5 million.\u00a0He has promised to donate the proceeds to charity.Rock band Kings of Leon is offering a version of their latest album with the tokens that come with extras.A blockchain company bought a piece of work by British artist Banksy, burned it, and then put a digital version on sale through a non-fungible token.Dramatic 'moments' from National Basketball Association games have also become collectable items as non-fungible tokens, despite remaining freely viewable online.A 10-second clip showing a spectacular sequence by superstar LeBron James fetched $208,000 on the NBA Top Shot site last month.And the Associated Press is offering NFT digital artwork - a depiction of the U.S. presidential election's electoral college map as viewed from space.       Earlier in March, a man paid $208,000 for a clip (pictured above) of LeBron James dunking through an auction by NBA Top Shot, which mints basketball highlights into NFTs.\u00a0Dramatic 'moments' from National Basketball Association games have also become collectable items as non-fungible tokens, despite remaining freely viewable online         Since February 14, an artist named Pest Supply has netted more than $1million auctioning off his NFTs featuring Banksy-style graffiti, including one piece (pictured) that sold for 60 Ethereum coins (ETH), or about $100,000",

        "full article": "By Frank Pingue March 11 (Reuters) - Sergio Garcia will not compete in the final Masters tune-up event in a bid to avoid potential COVID-19 exposure with fans ahead of the year's first major, the former champion said on Thursday. Garcia, who withdrew from last November's Masters after testing positive for the virus days before the tournament began, said it is great to see fans returning to PGA Tour events but to avoid risk he felt it was best to sit out the April 1-4 Texas Open. \"I'm not playing the week before (the Masters), we have fans back, so you know that at any time you might get it from any one of them,\" Garcia said after carding 65 to grab the early first-round lead at The Players Championship. \"Not that they're trying to give it to you or anything like that, but it might happen.\" The PGA Tour recently began welcoming a limited number of spectators at tournaments but The Players Championship, which has long been considered golf's unofficial fifth major, will be the most attended so far this year. As many as 10,000 fans are expected at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, for each of the tournament's four rounds. \"I would love to get closer to the fans, but there's too much at risk, at stake for us and if we get COVID because of anything, we're the one that pays. We pay the price. No one else does,\" said Garcia. \"So we have to be very careful as the fans come back into our game, which is great to have them, don't get me wrong.\" Garcia, whose 2017 Masters triumph remains the sole major triumph of his career, said he did not get too sick after his positive test but that he passed the virus along to his wife and she got it worse than him. As a result of missing last year's Masters, which was postponed from its usual April slot because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Garcia's impressive streak of 84 consecutive major starts came to an end. \"It was unfortunate, it was unfortunate for -- I'm not too much of a record kind of guy, but it was nice to have that streak going,\" said Garcia. \"I think I was quite close to catching up with Tom Watson as second most all time.\" While the Spaniard was not at Augusta National Golf Club for last year's Masters, he kept a close eye on the tournament and felt it lacked the usual feel that accompanies what is typically the most anticipated event on the golf calendar. \"To be totally honest, if I had to miss any Masters, that probably was the one,\" said Garcia. \"Obviously playing in November, the Masters is unbelievable, but it didn't have the feel that it has in April, for sure.\" (Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",

        "full article": "MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - Autogrill's chief executive said on Thursday he was upbeat about its long-term prospects although the Italian caterer booked a 480 million euro loss last year when the pandemic emptied bars and restaurants it runs in airports and motorways. The group controlled by the Benetton family said adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 82% year-on-year to 155 million euros ($185.75 million). Sales came in at 2 billion euros, more than halved from 2019. The Milan-based group said revenue fell about 65% year-on-year at constant exchange rates in January and February this year. Despite a weak start to the year, it expects revenue to come in at between 2.4 billion and 2.8 billion euros this year and reach 4.7 billion in 2024. Underlying operating margin, a measure of profitability, is seen touching 6.0% in 2024. \"In the long term, we will unleash Autogrill's full potential and achieve again significant profitable growth, with even higher margins compared to pre-COVID-19,\" Chief Executive Gianmario Tondato Da Ruos said in a statement. Autogrill, which plans to launch a rights issue of up to 600 million euros later this year, said it extended the covenant waiver period on some of its credit facilities through Dec. 31 2022, assuming the positive outcome of a covenant test in September 2022.

        "full article": "Filip Helander\u2019s away goal was the perfect hangover cure for Rangers as the newly-crowned Scottish champions recovered to claim a 1-1 draw with Slavia Prague in the Czech capital. Steven Gerrard\u2019s team spent Sunday partying after sealing the Ibrox outfit\u2019s first league title in a decade. But their wild weekend appeared to catch up with them at the Eden Arena as they backed off to allow Nicolae Stanciu to fire Slavia into an early lead. \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/iT8xxMcTkN\u2014 Rangers Football Club (@RangersFC) March 11, 2021   However, Gers hope they will be toasting progression to the Europa League last eight after next week\u2019s second leg at Ibrox. Helander\u2019s tap-in preserved their 12-game unbeaten run against continental opposition and set them up with a golden chance to march on again, while they were also thankful for a stunning late save from Allan McGregor. Rangers started like a team who could still taste what they had drunk at the weekend \u2013 which judging by the videos leaked from the Ibrox dressing room was plenty. Slavia, though, were in no mood to show sympathy. With Gerrard\u2019s team far too passive, it took the Czechs just seven minutes to take advantage. Lukas Provod\u2019s cross-field pass found Peter Olayinka out wide, who was allowed to roll the ball back to Stanciu on the corner of the box as Nathan Patterson failed to get tight. Connor Goldson also stood off while Ianis Hagi arrived too late to stop his fellow Romanian sweeping an unstoppable strike past McGregor from 20 yards out. The Light Blues were looking green around the gills. Goldson and Glen Kamara were both caught in possession, Joe Aribo was late into a challenge, while Ryan Kent put the ball straight out of the park. Helander and McGregor almost got in a mix-up too as Jan Kuchta put them under pressure, and it became abundantly clear Slavia \u2013 who just like Gers have yet to suffer a domestic league defeat this term and who dumped Leicester out of Europe last month \u2013 would not be as generous as previous opponents Royal Antwerp. However, slowly the colour returned to Rangers\u2019 cheeks. They still had to ride their luck. Provod slid in Kuchta but his shot bobbled wide, while McGregor had to remain alert as Provod tried to whip a sneaky wide free-kick into the near post. Rangers needed a break of the ball to go their way \u2013 and they got one off Goldson\u2019s knee nine minutes before the break. Alfredo Morelos won his team the chance to send the big men forward but it appeared it was for nothing as Borna Barisic\u2019s deep free-kick bounced off Goldson. Slavia stopper Ondrej Kolar paused assuming it was running out. But it was a fatal mistake as Hagi refused to give the opportunity up and raced to the by-line to hook it back for Helander to tap home. The half-time break offered Gerrard\u2019s team a welcome breather and the chance to regroup. And Aribo soon caught a second wind. He fired wide with one chance but his dancing feet were note perfect as he skipped into the box before cutting back for Kent, whose shot fired into the turf and was then clawed away by the scrambling Kolar before it dropped under his crossbar. And Prague were relieved again on 68 minutes as Goldson failed to get a clean connection on another teasing Barisic delivery when a firm header would surely have put Rangers ahead. Aribo again was the man playing the champagne stuff as he jinked beautifully into the box. But instead of taking the strike himself, the move went flat as he failed to pick out Morelos at the back post. Patterson was put through another stiff test of his abilities but the 19-year-old stood up to the test with a vital late block, while a breathtaking save from McGregor denied Lukas Masopust to ensure Rangers\u2019 quarter-finals dreams remain intact ahead of next week\u2019s Glasgow return.",

He will be assisted by Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, former Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce and Villanova coach Jay Wright. The list of finalists includes nine members of the gold medal-winning 2016 U.S. Olympic Team, seven gold medalists from the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team and three gold medalists from the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team. The USA National Team's complete training schedule for 2021 has yet to be announced. --Field Level Media",

        "title": "Georgetown upsets Big East top seed Villanova 72-71 at MSG",
        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - Patrick Ewing and Georgetown are making some noise at Madison Square Garden again. It has been a while. The Hoyas are back in the Big East Tournament semifinals for the first time in six years, with the former Georgetown and Knicks star leading the way. Dante Harris made two free throws with 4.7 seconds left to cap a perfect game from the line for Georgetown, and the Hoyas upset No. 14 Villanova 72-71 in the quarterfinals on Thursday. The eighth-seeded Hoyas (11-12) will play fifth-seeded Seton Hall on Friday night. Georgetown last reached the Big East semifinals in 2015. The Hoyas have not won the tournament since 2007. \"We took another step - in my house, by the way. This is my house,\" Ewing said in a postgame television interview. \"It\u00b4s a great win. Huge win.\"          Georgetown center Qudus Wahab (34) fists bumps head coach Patrick Ewing during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game against Villanova in the quarterfinals of the Big East conference tournament, Thursday, March 11, 2021, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)  Before Ewing became a Hall of Fame center for the Knicks, his Georgetown teams in the mid-1980s were the beasts of the Big East. Villanova has taken over that role in recent years, winning the last three tournament titles and dominating the Hoyas in the process. Villanova had won four straight meetings and 13 of 15 against the Hoyas before Thursday. \"We played against the Cadillac, the Bentley, whatever you want to call them, of the Big East - the class of the Big East. And once upon a time that was us. But we took a huge step to be able to knock them off,\" Ewing said. Harris led the way with 18 points and drew a foul on Jeremiah Robinson-Earl driving to the basket with 4.7 seconds to go and the Hoyas down one. Harris rattled in the first and swished the second to make Georgetown 23 of 23 from the line, the first time a team has shot 100% on at least 20 attempts in the Big East Tournament. With no timeouts left, Caleb Daniels rushed up court and got off a long 3-pointer in traffic for Villanova, but it missed badly. The top-seeded Wildcats (16-6), playing without injured star Collin Gillespie, had advanced to the Big East semifinals the last five times the tournament was completed. Last year\u00b4s ended halfway through the noon quarterfinal, when the pandemic brought the college basketball season to a halt. The quarterfinal day at the Garden is often the best of the Big East Tournament. The marathon quadruple-header keeps MSG buzzing from noon to midnight. Not this year. With COVID-19 restrictions still in place, the Garden was mostly empty for an old-school Big East rivalry between Wildcats and Hoyas. Ewing\u00b4s booming voice echoed through the rafters. \"Rebound! Rebound!\" he shouted after just about every Villanova shot went up. Each quarterfinal team was given 100 tickets to Thursday\u00b4s games. There were maybe a few dozen people in the stands for the noon tipoff. A \"Let\u00b4s Go Nova!\" chant didn\u00b4t last long or find many takers. \"It was pretty cool to have some fans in there,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \"Not a lot.\" COVID protocols even made it difficult for Ewing to move freely inside the Garden. He said he would have to ask Knicks owner James Dolan about the frequent stops to check his credentials. \"Everybody in this building should know who the hell I am,\" Ewing said. \"I was like, what the hell? Is this Madison Square Garden? I\u00b4m going to have to call Mr, Dolan and say, `Jeez, is my number in the rafters or what?\u00b4\" MSG Entertainment released a statement saying Ewing and Dolan have a long-standing relationship and the two spoke later in the day. \"We all know, respect and appreciate what (Ewing) means to The Garden and New York. Good luck to him and his Hoyas in the Big East semifinals,\" the statement said. Robinson-Earl led the Wildcats with 26 points and Jermaine Samuels added 20. The Wildcats went up 70-65 with 1:29 left on consecutive 3s by Cole Swider and Robinson-Earl. Villanova couldn't close. The Hoyas tied it when Qudus Wahab was fouled by Swider while dunking and completed the three-point play with 40 seconds left. Robinson-Earl made one of two from the line to make it 71-70 with 18.2 seconds left, and Ewing called a timeout to put the ball in Harris' hands. \"Down the stretch it got down to a one-possession game and they executed those last two possessions a little bit better than us,\" Wright said. \"We had a tough time controlling Harris.\" BIG PICTURE Georgetown: The Hoyas are 8-4 since a COVID-19 pause. They had not won even a single Big East Tournament game since 2016 before beating Marquette in the first round Wednesday. Villanova: Playing its second game without Gillespie (knee), their senior point guard and co-conference player of the year, the Wildcats started Chris Arcidiacono - whose big brother Ryan led the Wildcats to a national title in 2016 - for the first time. The sophomore contributed three points, five rebounds and four assists. Villanova did have third-leading Justin Moore (left ankle) available. He started the game on the sideline, riding a stationary bike, but ended up scoring 10 points in 27 minutes. UP NEXT Villanova awaits its NCAA Tournament assignment.

        "full article": "Thousands of people showed their support for health workers on Thursday evening by joining a nationwide slow handclap protest against the Government\u2019s controversial recommended 1% pay rise for staff. The event, organised by health unions and the TUC, mirrored the weekly applause for the NHS at the height of the coronavirus crisis last year. Anger has been mounting since it was revealed a week ago the Government had suggested to the NHS Pay Review Body that health workers should receive a 1% wage increase. Unison thanked members of the public and health workers who took part in the slow handclap, which will be repeated on April 1, the day staff should have been getting their next wage increase. Unison said many porters, midwives, cleaners, healthcare assistants, nurses, domestics and other NHS workers will end up leaving the health service unless there is an urgent rethink by the Government. The union\u2019s head of health Sara Gorton said: \u201cThe public took time to show the Government what they think of its plans for a stingy 1% pay rise for health workers.

They deserve not just our thanks, but to be properly recognised for their efforts, and rewarded too. \u201cHealth workers have given 100% but the Prime Minister and Chancellor think NHS staff are worth a measly 1%. \u201cThe public doesn\u2019t agree. People can see NHS staff been pushed to the limit. They know health workers shouldn\u2019t have to wait a moment longer for a decent pay rise. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound investment in the future of the NHS and would also be good for struggling local economies. It\u2019s time the Government realised this too.\u201d The Royal College of Nursing has set up an industrial action fund and Unite has warned of strikes in protest at the 1% figure.

        "full article": "By Simon Evans MANCHESTER, England, March 11 (Reuters) - A stoppage-time header from defender Simon Kjaer earned AC Milan a 1-1 draw at Manchester United in their Europa League last-16 first-leg match at Old Trafford on Thursday. Teenager Amad Diallo's 50th-minute goal had put United ahead before Kjaer angled in a fine header from Rade Krunic's corner in the final moments. The draw was justice for Stefano Pioli's Milan who had two goals ruled out in the opening 45 minutes as they opened up United with surprising ease. The 18-year-old Diallo, who joined United from Serie A club Atalanta in January, came on as a halftime substitute and claimed his first goal for the English side five minutes later. The Ivorian winger used clever movement to get behind the Milan defence, was picked out by a lofted ball from Bruno Fernandes and found the target with a smart back-header over Milan keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. United had been fortunate to go in level at the break. Rafael Leao had a fifth-minute effort ruled out for offside and then were very lucky when a Franck Kessie strike was ruled out for a questionable handball call by VAR. United keeper Dean Henderson had to make several saves but the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side should have gone ahead in the 39th minute when Harry Maguire somehow hit the post from point-blank range at the back post. Dan James missed another sitter after United had gone in front, turning Mason Greenwood's cross wide when unmarked and five metres out. (Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Ed Osmond)",

Viewers have gathered on social media to discuss love, life or death plotlines from recent and more older seasons. Chandra Wilson, an original cast member, noticed this trend and has been viewing old episodes herself - with her daughter. \"If it was up to her, we\u00b4d have been done with 16 seasons in 16 days,\" she laughs. \"I\u00b4m new to this whole binging thing.\"          Chandra Wilson, right, appears with Ellen Pompeo in a scene from \"Grey's Anatomy.\" Season 17 airs Thursdays on ABC. (ABC via AP)  Watching old episodes has given her daughter the chance to pass verdict on the similarities between Wilson and her character, Dr. Miranda Bailey. \"I always say that we just really are different people for so many reasons, the way we talk, how we think, what we say to people,\" explains Wilson. \"But from my daughter\u00b4s perspective, she would say, `no that\u00b4s you, that\u00b4s you Ma.'\" Something that hasn\u00b4t changed during her 16 years as Bailey - and often as a director on the show - is the influence of her character. Bailey is a successful Black female surgeon, who has coped with mental health issues yet takes no nonsense from anyone. This fictional character has provided real life career options for viewers. Since the first season of the ABC series created by Shonda Rimes - Krista Vernoff is the current showrunner - \"Grey's Anatomy'' has received mail from people inspired to pursue medical careers. \"They tell us about where they are in residency or where they are in med school or are or, you know, just that this door has opened up for them, but particularly women of color that let me know before I saw a Miranda Bailey on television, that I hadn\u00b4t even thought of that for myself.\" Letters have been sent by surgeons, general practitioners and nurses. \"If that\u00b4s the service that we have provided with all these seasons, then we will take it, because it\u00b4s just amazing,\" she adds. An added responsibility in 2020-2021 is the portrayal of the pandemic. \"Grey\u00b4s Anatomy,\" more than other U.S. medical drama, demonstrated the toll of COVID-19 on patients, health workers and the public in storylines across the first half of season 17. Bailey dealt with loss after she struggled to keep her parents safe. \"At the time that the episode aired where Miranda lost her mom, we hadn\u00b4t had like a national day of grieving yet. We hadn\u00b4t really been able to mourn yet as a country, as a community.\" says Wilson. \"So the response that that we got right away was, `this happened to me and I haven\u00b4t had a chance to cry yet. Thank you for giving me a place I could go to cry\u00b4.\" When the show went on hiatus in December, Ellen Pompeo\u00b4s Meredith Grey was on a ventilator fighting the coronavirus. Losing consciousness has led Grey to a dream state, where she\u00b4s met long dead characters - including her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) - on a beach. As it picks up this week, it\u00b4s expected she\u00b4ll still be ill. Could they kill off Meredith and end the series this year? Pompeo\u00b4s contract is up and there\u00b4s no word on if \"Grey\u00b4s Anatomy\" will survive long enough to tie up long-running storylines and say a proper goodbye to the beloved characters in a world beyond COVID-19. Wilson says that if it was the final season, there should be a lot of fanfare. \"I think after 17 seasons, our show deserves the biggest celebration, end, final season ever,\" she said.

        "title": "Officials seize goats from home of environmental activist",
        "full article": "HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut authorities have seized dozens of goats from the home of a longtime environmental activist, in response to citizen complaints and surveillance that revealed animal welfare concerns, according to the state Department of Agriculture. State and local officials said they executed a search and seizure warrant Wednesday at the home of Nancy Burton, the founder of the Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone, a watchdog group that has been critical of the Millstone nuclear power complex in Waterford, Connecticut, for the past two decades. The department said it received a complaint in October about \"injured goats and general care issues\" on Burton\u00b4s property in Redding, Connecticut. Officials said the search and seizure warrant was approved after citizen complaints and surveillance \"that revealed animal welfare concerns, including mobility issues due to untrimmed hooves, excessive manure, lack of sufficient water, and structures in poor condition that did not provide adequate protection from the weather.\" Burton told The Associated Press on Thursday that officials seized about 65 goats. She denied any of them were in poor health or neglected in any way. Burton accused officials of taking the goats not because of neglect, but to stop her testing of goat milk for radioactive materials linked to nuclear power plants. She also said she has been trying to find animal sanctuaries to take most of her goats, and state officials are aware of those efforts. \"This case is about goat milk,\" Burton said. \"And goat milk is not popular at (Department of Energy and Environmental Protection) or Department of Agriculture or the state of Connecticut because it's proof positive of contamination of the environment by nuclear power plants. So that\u00b4s what this is about.\" Burton was the owner of Katie the Goat, which she adopted in 2006. She said Katie grazed 5 miles (8 kilometers) downwind from the Millstone nuclear complex and its milk contained excessive radioisotope levels. She brought Katie to the state Capitol in 2006 on a mission to inform officials about nuclear radiation. Katie died in 2012 from cancer, Burton said. Burton said she kept goats on her property to continue testing of their milk, because her property is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the Indian Point nuclear power station in Buchanan, New York. She said, however, that she has not done milk testing recently. The seized goats were taken to the Agriculture Department's rescue and rehabilitation facility at the state prison in Niantic and were to be evaluated by a veterinarian, the agency said. The state will retain custody of the animals until the case is adjudicated in the court system, officials said. State and local animal control officials visited the property numerous times and met with Burton to try to resolve the animal care concerns, the department said. Removal of animals is a last resort, officials said. The Agriculture Department also said there were complaints dating back to 2017 about roaming goats and about the number of goats on Burton's property. Disputes between Burton and the town over her goats are also the subjects of court cases that remain pending.",

        "full article": "Teenage substitute Amad Diallo opened his Manchester United account in style but Simon Kjaer\u2019s stoppage-time header denied Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s men victory against AC Milan in the Europa League. The eagerly-anticipated last-16 clash between these European heavyweights produced drama on Thursday night and set-up an interesting return fixture at San Siro next week. Half-time substitute Diallo\u2019s superb, improvised header looked to have secured a hard-fought first-leg win at Old Trafford, only for Kjaer\u2019s last-gasp header to seal Milan a deserved 1-1 draw. A disappointing end to the first leg of our last-16 tie.\ud83d\udd34 #MUFC\ud83c\udfc6 #UEL\u2014 Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 11, 2021   In truth, Solskjaer\u2019s side would have been fortunate to be going to Italy in the lead given how the absentee-hit Rossoneri outplayed the hosts for large periods. United looked a shell of the side that impressively won at Manchester City on Sunday and Franck Kessie was denied an early opener when the video assistant referee contentiously ruled he had handled. The hosts were second best throughout the opening period but inexplicably failed to go into the break ahead as unmarked Harry Maguire met a flicked-on corner with a shinned effort that hit the post. Substitute Diallo did better when expertly heading in from Bruno Fernandes\u2019 superb chipped pass, but Milan secured a potentially crucial away goal at the death when Kjaer capitalised on United\u2019s inability to defend set pieces. Milan deserved this result at Old Trafford, where they played impressively despite being without the likes of former United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Theo Hernandez and Ante Rebic among others. Rafael Leao saw a fifth-minute opener ruled out for offside as Stefano Pioli\u2019s men started on the front foot, with the Rossoneri finding the net again in the 11th minute. United were caught napping as Kessie controlled a throw-in from the right and continued to hit a smart strike past Dean Henderson to send the depleted visitors wild. There were few complaints about the goal as the teams lined up for kick-off, only for Solskjaer\u2019s men to be given a surprise reprieve as VAR Bastian Dankert surprisingly cancelled the goal out for a Kessie handball. It was a controversial decision but Milan continued unflustered, with Alexis Saelemaekers proving a handful as Manchester City academy graduate Brahim Diaz probed. Rade Krunic mishit an effort before Saelemaekers tested Henderson as the Rossoneri continued in the ascendancy, leading skipper Maguire to angrily admonish his team-mates. A smart early Anthony Martial effort tipped over by Gianluigi Donnarumma was the best the hosts had mustered until Maguire wasted a glorious chance to score an undeserved 38th-minute opener. Alex Telles swung in a corner that Fernandes flicked on to the far post, where the unopposed United skipper somehow failed to convert from point-blank range as the ball spun off his foot and away from goal. The hosts will have been relieved to hear the half-time whistle after a torrid first half, with Diallo emerging in place of Martial when the teams re-emerged. This was just the 18-year-old\u2019s third substitute appearance for United but he made quite the impact, putting the hosts ahead within five minutes of coming on. Diallo darted between Chelsea loanee Fikayo Tomori and Diogo Dalot, who is on loan from United, to meet Fernandes ball with a fine back header over Milan goalkeeper Donnarumma. It was a gut punch for the impressive visitors, who could have gone further behind had it not been for a timely block on Daniel James. Milan eventually rallied and began to exert pressure again, with Kessie denied by Henderson before Krunic somehow failed to get a Davide Calabria cross on target. James turned a whipped cross badly wide as the heavens opened and play became stretched, with Milan screaming for Scott McTominay to pick up a second booking as the clock wound down. The Rossoneri pushed relentlessly for a leveller and grabbed an away goal in stoppage time. Nemanja Matic lost Kjaer when a corner came in to get away a header that Henderson should have kept out.",

        "full article": "LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Western governments condemned on Thursday an attack by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on the city of Marib, according to a statement released by Britain's foreign ministry. \"We, the governments of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, condemn the sustained Houthi offensive on the Yemeni city of Marib and the major escalation of attacks the Houthis have conducted and claimed against Saudi Arabia,\" the statement said. The Houthis, who control Yemen's most populous areas and have been battling a Saudi-led coalition since it intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, have recently pushed towards the gas-rich region of Marib, aiming to take the government\u00b4s last stronghold in the north of Yemen.

        "full article": "Houston Texans head coach David Culley said quarterback Deshaun Watson will not be traded. Watson, who spoke to Culley via Zoom two weeks ago, has formally requested a trade. The first-year coach of the Texans, Culley has been on the job for just over a month and remains unwavering in his stated intention to keep Watson in Houston. \"It's not a matter of changing anyone's mind. We are committed to him, and we are going to move forward,\" Culley said. The Texans have not disclosed details of the conversation with Watson, and Culley again Thursday said he wasn't willing to share anything between the two sides. Oddsmakers continue to favor the Texans as the team Watson plays for in 2021, including PointsBet favoring Houston over the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos. Asked Thursday how the Texans knew Watson was committed to the team, Culley said: \"He's a Houston Texan.\" Culley's message is unchanged from the previous formal media access to the coach and new Texans general manager Nick Caserio. The mission ahead appears pocked with challenges, included limited salary cap space and draft capital. The Texans traded their first-round pick -- which turned out to be No. 3 overall -- to the Miami Dolphins in the Laremy Tunsil deal, one of the many trades made by head coach Bill O'Brien that included high picks. \"Before we take a few questions: Organizationally, we want to reiterate our commitment to Deshaun Watson. We have zero interest in trading the player,\" Caserio said in February. --Field Level Media",

        "title": "Nikola Jokic, Nuggets tip off second half vs. Grizzlies",
        "full article": "The Denver Nuggets return to action for the first time since the NBA All-Star break on Friday, traveling to Memphis, Tenn., to face a Memphis Grizzlies team as close to full strength it has been on the season. Playing its first game in eight days, Denver is looking to conclude a five-game road swing that began on Feb. 27 a perfect 5-0. The Nuggets won the fourth of their consecutive road games on March 4, 113-103 at Indiana, behind three 20-point-plus efforts. Among them was Nikola Jokic, who flirted with a triple-double at 20 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. Jokic played his way into a starting spot at last weekend's All-Star Game with averages of 27.1 points, 11 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game. \"(I am) playing the way I've played since I was a kid, and I'm just lucky to have coaches who gave me freedom in the past, and (Nuggets) coach (Michael) Malone gave me the freedom right now,\" Jokic said in his post-All-Star Game press conference of his ability to make an impact in multiple phases of the game from the center position. This season marked Jokic's third straight as an All-Star, and the Denver post presence is a contender for the 2020-21 Most Valuable Player Award. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins campaigned for Grizzlies second-year guard Ja Morant to receive an All-Star roster spot. Although Morant did not land his first All-Star selection, the 2019-20 NBA Rookie of the Year leads a Memphis squad in contention for a playoff berth with 19.8 points and 7.8 assists per game. Morant missed eight games early in the campaign due to an ankle injury. Since his return on Jan. 16, the Grizzlies are two games over .500 -- including a 127-112 defeat of Washington on Wednesday in their first game back from the break. Morant was one of two Grizzlies with double-doubles in the win, scoring 21 points and dishing 10 assists. Jonas Valanciunas scored 29 points and grabbed 20 rebounds. Valanciunas likely draws the assignment opposite Jokic on Friday, as Memphis seeks back-to-back big defensive performances. On Wednesday against Washington, it was guard Dillon Brooks with the honors against NBA-leading scorer Bradley Beal. Brooks helped limit Beal to 21 points on 6-of-22 shooting from the floor. \"I just rise to the occasion and take on the challenge and see if he can last a full 48 (minutes) with a lot of physicality,\" Brooks said in his postgame press conference. With Valanciunas on Jokic on the interior, Brooks and the Grizzlies perimeter defenders will try to contain Jamal Murray. The Denver guard comes into Friday's matchup averaging 21.8 points per game and has scored at least 23 points in every game since Feb. 14. On Feb. 19, Murray scored a career-high 50 points against Cleveland. Limiting Denver, the NBA's fourth-highest scoring offense at 115.9 points per game, is not a one- or two-man task. Memphis will be able to go deeper into its rotation than it has much of the season. Ravaged by injury much of the season, the Grizzlies welcomed back Justise Winslow from a hip injury on Feb. 20. Brandon Clarke, who missed five games in February due to injuries, grabbed 10 rebounds on Wednesday. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Direct deposits from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden on Thursday will hit people's bank accounts as early as this weekend, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. With the signing of the stimulus bill, Biden commemorated the one-year anniversary of a U.S. lockdown to counter the coronavirus pandemic with a measure designed to bring relief to Americans and boost the economy. \"People can expect to start seeing direct deposits hit their bank accounts as early as this weekend. This is, of course, just the first wave,\" Psaki said. Payments to eligible Americans will continue throughout the course of the next several weeks, she added. The relief package is set to provide $400 billion in direct payments of $1,400 per person, helping individuals earning less than $80,000 annually and couples making less than $160,000. Nearly 160 million households are expected to get payments, according to White House estimates. The bill includes an expanded child tax credit of up to $3,000 per child, or $3,600 for each child under age 6. The Internal Revenue Service will pay part of that in monthly installments of $250 or $300 from July through December, adding a benefits distributor role to the revenue collection agency\u00b4s responsibilities. Making one-off payments to those who regularly file tax returns should not be a struggle for the IRS, tax experts said. White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said on CNN the administration will avoid fraud in COVID-19 relief funds, which was experienced during the Trump administration, by exercising \"extreme vigilance.\" \"This is something, again, that President Biden has a lot of experience with having overseen the implementation of the recovery act with less than 1% of waste, fraud and abuse. It requires attention to detail which is something that the President is extremely focused on.\" (Reporting by Jeff Mason and Nandita Bose in Washington; Additional reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Leslie Adler and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "full article": "It's been a tumultuous week for the royal family. After Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's shocking tell-all Oprah interview, the Queen has tried to keep the peace and mollify not just the British public, but the commonwealth, Harry and Meghan, Prince Charles and an angry Prince William, all while her husband Prince Philip spends his fourth weekend in the hospital. Here's everything you need to know.\u00a0         THE QUEEN BREAKS HER SILENCE: On Tuesday, two days after Harry and Meghan Markle's bombshell interview with Oprah aired in the United States, Her Majesty released a statement cajoling Harry while also questioning the veracity of the shocking allegations made against her family and the royal institution. She said: 'The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.'         According to Royal experts, the Queen's statement was edged with sadness but was designed in a way to assure both Harry, Meghan and the public that the concerns raised in the Oprah interview will be addressed. 'I think the main point there has always been that the Queen has said whatever decision Prince Harry and Meghan take... Her Majesty and the Family wish them well,' Charles Anson, the Queen's former press secretary said. Royal author Phil Dampier, however, focused more on the Queen's use of the phrase 'recollections vary'. 'The Queen is really saying that Harry and Meghan might be giving their version of events or their interpretation of a conversation a couple of years ago, without going so for as to say they are lying, which they might not be,' he said. 'Clearly she has spoken to the person who allegedly made the remark about Archie and they have given her their version of events.' He added: 'Above all she wants to keep the identity of the senior royal who made the alleged remark about Archie's skin color a secret. She knows that if it comes out that person will never be allowed to forget it, rightly or wrongly.'\u00a0             Earlier in the week, a senior palace source claimed the delayed statement from the Queen was partly down to a lack of 'trust' between the Windsors and the Sussexes, with fears a denial without fully investigating the claims could damage the palace even further. 'A denial could lead the Sussexes breaking their vow and naming the member of the royal family who discussed their son's skin color. There is a lack of trust,' an insider told the Evening Standard.\u00a0         WILLIAM DEFENDS HIS FAMILY: Prince William, on the other hand, appeared visibly upset when reporters asked him about his brother's interview during a public engagement on Thursday. 'We're very much not a racist family,' William said as he and Kate Middleton walked past the press. He also said that he hasn't spoken to his brother since the interview aired but he will soon. The 38-year-old future king is the first royal to personally respond to any of the issues raised by Meghan and Harry during their interview.\u00a0         As a whole, the Windsors have been trying to stay focused and keep their heads up amid the interview fallout. William commented on Harry's interview after speaking with Kate about mental health during a visit to School21 in east London \u2014 an event that was planned before Meghan Markle shared her own mental health struggles with the world. It was also the first engagement for Duchess Kate since she was personally implicated by Megan, who accused Kate of making her cry in the days leading up to her wedding.\u00a0         On Tuesday, Charles visited a church pop-up vaccine clinic in London but stayed mum on the interview,\u00a0choosing instead to focus on the hard work nurses and other medical personnel were doing to dole out coronavirus vaccinations. 'I can't imagine how exhausting it is' he said at one point while a nurse spoke about her duties. Parishioners were impressed by the prince's composure during such a hectic moment in his personal life. 'He was quite interactive with the people in there in spite of all the drama going on,' said one parishioner. 'In spite of the family drama he still took time out to come here... racism, I don't believe that'.\u00a0         THE FULL FACT CHECK: Although much of Harry and Meghan's interview was an outpouring of emotion, many of the claims they made can be reinforced - or knocked down - with facts. Meghan's claim that she never researched Harry or his family, for example, is inconsistent with reports made in the couple's biography Finding Freedom that claimed 'both participants in this blind date did their homework with a thorough Google search'. Statements made by Meghan's friends also seem to contradict the Duchess' claim including Ninaki Priddy, Meghan's maid of honor at her first wedding, who recounted Meghan's fascination with the royal family and even claimed 'she wants to be Princess Diana 2.0'. It's also unlikely Harry and Meghan were secretly wed three days prior to their official wedding as Church of England marriages require at least two witnesses and unrestricted public access to the marriage site to allow for objections.\u00a0         Meghan's claims concerning Archie's title are factually incorrect according to King George V's 1917 written order that only royal children in the direct line of succession should receive HRH titles and be styled a prince or princess. Under these rules, Archie is entitled to be a prince when his grandfather, Charles, accedes the throne - but not before that. Meghan and Harry also incorrectly suggested that Archie was deprived of 24/7 security because he was not a prince even though other royals including Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Sophie Wessex and more make do without the police protection despite working hundreds of engagements a year in the name of the Queen.       It's also very difficult to verify several of Meghan and Harry's claims, including the Palace's supposed refusal to help Meghan deal with her mental health, whether or not Kate Middleton made Meghan cry in the days leading up to her wedding and whether or not the couple witnessed racism inside the monarchy.\u00a0         NO REGRETS: Despite the swirling media coverage and push back from the royal family, Meghan's friends claim the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no regrets. An insider with close ties to Meghan told DailyMail.com exclusively, '[Meghan] said she has absolutely no regrets about what was said during the interview and that speaking with Oprah was both cathartic and transformative - the best decision she ever made, other than marrying Harry.' She continued: 'Meghan said the Royal institution should be relieved that she didn't name names or go into even more details of what went on behind closed doors. She said she stands by her truth and that ultimately everyone involved wins because it's now all out in the open and from there the healing can begin.'         According to the anonymous source, Meghan and Harry also credit their mothers for the courage and strength they needed to do the interview. 'Meghan credits her mom and Princess Diana for giving them [Meghan and Harry] the strength and courage to come forward and tell it like it is. She said it was especially nerve-wracking for Harry to show his vulnerability, and that she's incredibly proud of him... She added title or no title, Harry will always be her prince.'",

It was commissioned into service on December 11, 1998.At $6billion, the USS Connecticut and its sister vessel, the USS Jimmy Carter, which is also a Seawolf-class submarine, are the most expensive attack subs ever built.The high costs reflect its considerable performance capability in the field of intelligence gathering, particularly in the Arctic Ocean under thick ice.The Connecticut and other Seawolf-class submarines take part in the biennial ICEX drills staged by the Navy.The Arctic region is considered one of growing strategic importance given the vast amounts of untapped natural resources that lie beneath the surface of the ocean as well as the shipping routes that are now opening up thanks to climate change.\u00a0Motto:\u00a0'Arsenal of the Nation'\u00a0Class and type:\u00a0Seawolf-class submarineComplement: 15 officers, 101 enlisted\u00a0Displacement: 7,568 tons light, 9,137 tons full, 1,569 tons deadLength: 107.5 meters (353 feet) overall, 107.5 meters (353 feet) waterlineBeam: 12.1 meters (40 feet)Draft: 10.9 meters (36 feet)Propulsion: One S6W reactorArmament: Eight 26-inch torpedo tubes, 40 torpedoes and missiles, or 100 mines\u00a0Advertisement",

        "title": "Big finish sends Garcia to big lead at Players Championship",
        "full article": "PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Sergio Garcia rushed to the first tee and raced to the finish line Thursday in The Players Championship. Most importantly, he avoided the kind of wreck that allowed the TPC Sawgrass to live up to its reputation as the course where anything can happen to anyone at any time. Garcia thought he had plenty of time to get from the range to the 10th tee to start his round. The sun was in his eyes when he looked at the clock, he wasn't sure what he saw, jogged the rest of the way and had a minute to spare. Then he fired off a 7-under 65, capped off by a birdie-birdie-eagle finish for a two-shot lead over Brian Harman. It was a solid day that became brilliant over the final three holes. Garcia only had to look next to him to see what kind of damage the Stadium Course inflicted, even on a pristine day of pleasant sunshine and a mild breeze. Rory McIlroy, the defending champion, opened with a double bogey from the trees. He hit two in the water on the 18th and made a quadruple-bogey 8. He wound up with a 79, his worst score since his opening round at Royal Portrush in the 2019 British Open.          Sergio Garcia, of Spain, lines up a putt on the fifth hole during the first round of the The Players Championship golf tournament Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)  When darkness brought the first round to a halt - 21 players didn't finish - there already were 13 scores of 80 or higher. That included Henrik Stenson with an 85, his highest score ever on the PGA Tour. There were 22 scores of triple bogey or worse. Garcia took eight shots to play his final three holes. Byeong Hun An took 11 shots on the par-3 17th hole. The Spaniard feels comfortable on a course that causes anxiety even in good weather. \"For some reason, it just kind of fits my eye,\" said Garcia, who won The Players in 2008 and has twice been runner-up. \"I see what I want to do pretty much every hole, and then it's a matter of doing it.\" Harman played in the afternoon and was hanging around par until he began the back nine with three straight birdies, shot 31 on the back and wound up with a 67. British Open champion Shane Lowry took bogey on his final hole for a 68 and was tied with Corey Conners and Matt Fitzpatrick. Bryson DeChambeau, coming off his victory last week at Bay Hill, had to take a little off his driver on the par-5 16th and had 9-iron left, setting up a birdie-birdie-par finish to join the group at 69. The small number of fans - by Sawgrass standards - saw a little bit of everything. It started early with McIlroy, who shot 43 on his opening nine holes. \"The big number on 18 didn't help and then doubling the first wasn't helpful, either,\" he said. \"It's hard to recover when you just haven't played good. If you take that 18th hole out, it still wasn't a very good day.\" Stenson hit into the water on consecutive holes for a double bogey and a triple bogey. He put two more in the water, including one of 18 balls in the water on the island-green 17th. Three of those belonged to Kevin Na, who made an 8 and then withdrew after signing for an 81. Ian Poulter (77) sat for lunch with McIlroy, Stenson and Tyrrell Hatton (76) and posted video of this fearsome foursome that combined to go 29-over par. \"Oh, what a bunch of muppets,\" Poulter said. Rickie Fowler had three double bogeys in his round of 77, leaving him in danger of missing the cut and likely missing out on the Dell Match Play in two weeks. Dustin Johnson took double bogey on the par-5 11th and eagle on the par-5 16th in his round of 73. Jordan Spieth missed only two fairways and had to settle for a 70. Garcia's lone bogey came after perhaps his best shot. From the pine straw next to a tree left of the first fairway, he hooded an iron that came out low and right to left with enough run that it settled 25 feet away. And then he three-putted. The most remarkable round might have belonged to Hoge, who managed to get through 18 holes without a bogey. \"It was a good, solid day, kind of what you want here on the Stadium Course,\" Hoge said. \"I haven't been hitting it that well coming in here, so I just tried to hit a lot of greens and stay out of trouble for the most part.\" Sebastian Munoz was at 4 under with one hole to play, that being the 18th, and a shot into the water led to a triple bogey for a 71. He tried to take out the positives of five birdies, and that's what makes this tournament so tough to predict. There are plenty of birdies available. It doesn't take much to erase all the good work. \"You do have a lot of wedges in your hand,\" Munoz said. \"Par 5s are reachable. So yeah, we do have a lot more chances than a usual course. But I mean, danger is around the corner on every hole.\"          Sergio Garcia, of Spain, watches his tee shot on the sixth hole during the first round of the The Players Championship golf tournament Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.

        "title": "Prosecutor defends failed effort to convict Iowa journalist",
        "full article": "IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - An Iowa prosecutor defended his unsuccessful pursuit of charges against a journalist who was arrested while covering a protest, saying Thursday that he believed the evidence was strong and that dismissing the case would have amounted to special treatment. Polk County Attorney John Sarcone, a Democrat who has held office since 1991, dismissed the outrage he has faced over his decision to prosecute Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri as unwarranted. A Des Moines police officer pepper-sprayed and arrested Sahouri last May while she was on assignment reporting at a chaotic Black Lives Matter protest outside a mall. Sahouri, 25, was charged with disobeying police orders to disperse and interfering with the officer who arrested her. A jury acquitted Sahouri of both misdemeanors Wednesday after a three-day trial. Outside observers said they were stunned by the weakness of the prosecution's evidence and baffled by Sarcone\u00b4s decision to pursue the case for nine months. \"We felt there was more than sufficient facts to establish the case. Based on the facts and the law, we proceeded,\" Sarcone told The Associated Press by phone Thursday. \"We bring cases to jurors and let them decide. What I have a hard time understanding is how everyone wants to short-circuit the jury process.\" Dozens of press freedom and civil liberties groups asked Sarcone to dismiss the charges last summer, saying Sahouri was doing her job and that journalists must be free to cover protests. They blasted Sarcone after her acquittal for pursuing what they called a disgraceful abuse of prosecutorial discretion that wasted tax dollars.

(Kelsey Kremer/The Des Moines Register via AP, Pool)  Sarcone said he could not let outside pressure or criticism influence prosecutorial decisions. Dropping the case because of her status as a reporter and support from outside groups would have amounted to special treatment, he said. Sarcone denied that he had any \"ulterior motive\" in pursuing a case against a newspaper that has been critical of him over the years. He said Des Moines police investigators believed Sahouri broke the law by remaining near members of an unlawful assembly who were damaging commercial property and throwing rocks at officers after they were told to leave. His office agreed. \"She got arrested an hour-and-a-half after dispersal orders were given. Those are lawful orders. People can\u00b4t defy those lawful orders,\" Sarcone said. \"No one is above the law.\" But the evidence at trial suggested those orders weren\u00b4t clear, and Sahouri and others testified that they never heard them. The orders were issued 90 minutes before Sahouri was arrested as police were trying to clear an intersection where protesters surrounded a squad car. Officers were also heard telling protesters to \"back up\" and protest peacefully. Sahouri continued her reporting and was later pepper-sprayed and arrested while getting away from another location where police deployed tear gas to disperse protesters. Officer Luke Wilson claimed that she briefly resisted arrest by moving her arm away as she was temporarily blinded from the chemicals. He said he failed to record the arrest on his body camera and did not notify his supervisor, which are both violations of department policy. Sahouri, who is Palestinian-American, repeatedly identified herself as a journalist but was jailed nonetheless. A white Register colleague, Katie Akin, was next to her and was not arrested. A different officer testified that he let Akin go because she seemed compliant and scared. Sarcone denied allegations that the reporters' races played a role in their treatment, saying Akin \"probably got lucky\" to not be arrested. Sahouri told the AP on Thursday that she was the only journalist arrested that day, and she said it was \"extremely ironic\" that prosecutors used footage from television reporters at the scene in their case against her. She rejected a plea deal before trial in which she would have pleaded guilty to failure to disperse and the other charge would have been dismissed, saying she was grateful that the Register funded her defense. \"I was doing my job while complying with police orders,\" she said. \"I literally did nothing wrong.\" Several Democrats vowed to find a candidate to oppose Sarcone in a primary next year if he runs for a 9th four-year term. Sarcone, 70, declined to say whether he would run for re-election, but he broadly defended his tenure as successful. Sarcone won election by defeating a Democratic incumbent in a 1990 primary in which he criticized his opponent for delegating too much power to a female deputy, Maggi Moss. He hasn\u00b4t faced an opponent since. Moss, who was fired by Sarcone and later became a successful defense lawyer, said Thursday that she was disturbed by video showing Sahouri in pain from pepper spray. She said she was stunned the case was pursued in the face of \"common sense, the Constitution and individual rights.\" \"It leaves a bad taste. It was needless. It didn\u00b4t serve any public purpose. It was sad,\" Moss said. \"Whatever legacy was there for John, I think this will forever taint it.\"          Assistant Polk County Attorney Bradley Kinkade gives a closing statement on the final day of Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri's trial, at the Drake University Legal Clinic, Wednesday, March 10, 2021, in Des Moines, Iowa, after being arrested while covering a protest last summer. After deliberating for less than two hours, the jury found Sahouri not-guilty on misdemeanor charges of failure to disperse and interference with official acts.

        "full article": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Portland, Oregon, will pay more than $2 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit arising from the police killing of a Black teenager in 2017, but family members of Quanice Hayes say they are still upset that the officer who pulled the trigger was not disciplined. City commissioners apologized to the 17-year-old's family on Wednesday before approving the settlement during a City Council meeting. Hayes' death sparked protests in 2017 and was among those frequently cited by protesters who demonstrated against police brutality and racial injustice in Portland for months last summer. A Multnomah County grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing by Officer Andrew Hearst, who fired three shots at Hayes on Feb. 9, 2017, while investigating an armed robbery. According to previously released investigations, police discovered Hayes in an alcove in front of a home and ordered him to keep his hands up and crawl on the driveway toward officers. When Hayes appeared to reach toward his waistband, Hearst said he fired, killing Hayes. Officers found a fake airsoft pistol in a flowerbed about 18 inches away from Hayes, according to court records. The lawyer for Hayes' family, J. Ashlee Albies, called on the city this week to make meaningful changes so another Black teenager doesn\u00b4t die by police hands.

The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Quanice Hayes' grandmother and two uncles said they remain disturbed that Officer Andrew Hearst still works for the Police Bureau and faced no discipline. (AP Photo/Don Ryan, File)  \"There was no accountability,\" said Steven Hayes, Quanice Hayes\u00b4 uncle, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive. The family\u00b4s lawyers hired forensic biomechanical engineer Jesse L. Wobrock, who reviewed Hayes' wounds and the paths of the three bullets that hit him. Wobrock found that Hayes was on his knees, his head and neck bent forward and his torso leaning slightly forward to comply with officer orders to \"go down to his face\" when Hearst fired the shots. Hayes likely moved his hand to the ground to help him lie prone, Wobrock\u00b4s opinion said. Mayor Ted Wheeler, who serves as police commissioner, urged the council to approve the settlement, recognizing that money won\u00b4t replace the family\u00b4s loss. He urged everyone to consider how \"to improve the public structures and systems that too often are unable to prevent the circumstances that caused us to be here today,\" citing how schools, workplaces and other institutions fail young men, particularly Black and brown young men.

Governor Tate Reeves said the \"Mississippi Fairness Act\" would \"ensure young girls are not forced to compete against biological males.\" The bill requires public schools in the conservative southern state to designate sports teams based on biological sex as for \"Males,\" \"Females\" or \"Coed.\" \"Athletic teams or sports designated for 'females,' 'women,' or 'girls,' shall not be open to students of the male sex,\" it states. Human Rights Campaign (HRC), a group which defends LGBTQ rights, described the bill as \"discriminatory anti-transgender legislation\" and said it would be challenged in court. Similar legislation is pending in some 20 other US states. \"This law is a solution in search of a problem,\" HRC president Alphonso David said in a statement. \"Legislators in Mississippi have not provided any examples of Mississippi transgender athletes gaming the system for a competitive advantage because none exist.\" \"Governor Reeves knows this is not a problem in Mississippi and yet he insists on enthusiastically signing this bill to sow fear and division,\" David said. \"By making this harmful bill the law in Mississippi, Governor Reeves is openly welcoming discrimination and putting the lives of transgender kids in danger.\" President Joe Biden signed an executive order on his first day in office that states \"all persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.\" \"Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports,\" it says.",

        "full article": "For a reporter, Fabio Capello was a great England coach. He couldn\u2019t lie. True, his famously poor English was often exaggerated. Capello knew all the important words, for coaching. He knew enough to get by.What he didn\u2019t have was command of the language. And that is what makes a good liar.Capello didn\u2019t have enough English to dissemble, to cloud his words, to deploy nuance, to work the room. Straight questions therefore got straight answers. It was beautiful.         Fabio Capello was brutally honest but did not have a command of English to be anything elseThis much was apparent on day one. The Football Association arranged for Capello to meet the press, one from each newspaper, informally around the lunch table. There would be a brief period on the record, the rest off-limits.During the notebooks-out session, Capello was talking about what he wanted from his striker. His preference was for a physically imposing figure, tall, who could hold the ball up, play back to goal, bring in the midfield or the second striker.He was talking about a man like Luca Toni of Italy. What he certainly wasn\u2019t talking about was Michael Owen.Duly noted, it was asked what position Owen would play in Capello\u2019s ideal system. He thought about this, briefly. \u2018Number 12,\u2019 he said. And there it was, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.The FA press team were head in hands, but Capello was true to his word. Owen had 88 caps when Capello came into the job and retired on 89.He was a half-time substitute for Capello in a friendly against France. England reached the 2010 World Cup with Wayne Rooney as top goalscorer, playing No 10, behind Emile Heskey.              Jurgen Klopp insisted he will not be replacing Joachim Low as Germany boss after the EurosAnd this wasn\u2019t even peak truthfulness. After one game, Capello was asked rather excitedly about Theo Walcott. \u2018He played very well, didn\u2019t he, Fabio?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the manager and left it at that.Fine word, no. Says everything one wishes to convey, with the minimum elucidation.Robert Towne, the screenwriter, was once revising a script in which a wounded, bedridden veteran was asked if he was OK. The original had him responding with a long, wordy and tear-jerking speech. Towne changed it to that single-syllable negative and conveyed greater emotion.And when, this week, Jurgen Klopp was asked if he was interested in the Germany job, he said no and the conversation ended. He could have played politics. Could have looked at Liverpool\u2019s failings this season and tried to turn the situation to his advantage. Many of his peers and predecessors would have.One imagines Rafa Benitez, with a squad in need of overhaul and the Spain job up for grabs, might have sent the board a subtle reminder of his options if unsupported. Klopp could have done that.Could have gone down the road of never say never. Played with the mystery of what the future holds. Flattered his suitors, spoke of the challenge, said it was always an ambition at some stage in his career.       He has the English to do it. He has the command to not say yes, without saying no, and focus a few minds within the Fenway Sports Group.So, what a guy for playing it straight. He had the bargaining chip and he tossed it aside. Had the bargaining chip and instead remained focused on right now.There was a 2-0 lead against RB Leipzig to protect and a disappointing season to turn around. That was Klopp\u2019s priority, not some future boardroom battle over recruitment.He recognised that, at this point, Liverpool needed a declaration of faith and loyalty. On top of the many crises, to have the manager wobbling over his future would be devastating. The uncertainty could further undermine a team already low on confidence.So Klopp became their rock and was rewarded with a performance that might change Liverpool\u2019s season.It is not the first time this has happened, either. In the build-up to the Champions League final in 2019 he was linked with Juventus.On that occasion he went with one word, but two syllables \u2014\u2018Bulls***\u2019. Compare that to Mauricio Pochettino, manager of final opponents Tottenham, who by then was talking in riddles about his intentions that summer.         Klopp was honest when Liverpool needed it and he admirably refused to play politicsNext season, Tottenham lost their way, Liverpool won the league. It is hardly coincidence.Does Klopp want to coach Germany? Maybe one day. Yet when he spoke, there was no fear of upsetting the national association, no worry that they may take offence and wipe him from future shortlists.\u00a0Equally, if he does want investment in the summer, he is prepared to enter those discussions on merit, without an ace up his sleeve. Stefan Kuntz, currently Germany\u2019s Under 21 coach, may well have the job by then and while Klopp knows he will never be without alternatives, he could have strung both sides along for longer.He chose honesty instead \u2014 because it was the right and decent thing to do. When Klopp goes, eventually, no Liverpool manager will be harder to replace.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Liverpool return to form in the Champions League as Mo Salah...

Dortmund are not planning to keep Erling Haaland for ever \u2014 and he isn\u2019t expecting to stay.As it stands, this is a fair exchange. Dortmund have been good for his career, he will one day be good for their continued investment in similar individuals, such as Jude Bellingham.         Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli has proposed a couple of ludicrous ideas this weekYet if the option of selling Haaland for triple figures was unavailable, Dortmund\u2019s revenue stream would suffer. Equally, players would only agree shorter-term contracts and let them run down, rather than be trapped. Restrictions couldn\u2019t apply to free agents, so all that would change is the ability to command a fee.Agnelli\u2019s other brainstorm is to sell off the last 15 minutes of matches to attract younger fans who consume entertainment in bitesize morsels. He\u2019s stolen this one from basketball because the NBA have packages giving access to the final quarter. And there\u2019s a reason for that. The last quarter in basketball has a 40 per cent influence on the outcome of a game.\u00a0Football, being lower-scoring, isn\u2019t the same. With 15 minutes to go in the Champions League second legs this week, RB Leipzig needed four goals, Barcelona three and Sevilla two.\u00a0Only Juventus\u2019s match with Porto was finely balanced. Equally, in the previous round of Premier League matches \u2014 last weekend\u2019s fixtures, plus Manchester City v Southampton \u2014 six of 11 games had a difference of two goals or more with 15 minutes remaining, and two were goalless stalemates unlikely to appeal.No matter how brief your attention span, life really is too short for West Brom 0 Newcastle 0, in any format.One game had its outcome altered between 75 and 90 minutes in the Premier League, Leicester scoring late at Brighton. Maybe Agnelli can package that. He just needs to accurately forecast the future. Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s probably working on it.\u00a0 In shackling Bryson, golf has denied us brilliance\u00a0Bryson DeChambeau is the most interesting golfer since Tiger Woods, although not if those at the top get their way. At Sawgrass this week, DeChambeau announced a different approach to reaching the 460-yard par four 18th. Many professionals regard this as the hardest closing hole on the circuit.\u00a0It was designed to intimidate. The fairway is big to the right, but more visible from the tee is a giant expanse of water left. The traditional route crosses the water, skirts the bank, stays left of the trees and leaves about a six iron to the green. Miss left, splash. Miss right, the dread crack of ball against wood.DeChambeau saw a better way. He would go left, across the width of the water, a carry of roughly 310 yards, to a small patch of short grass near the ninth fairway. He could then hit a short iron across water again, having a much clearer view of the green. He didn\u2019t say he would, merely that he might. Depends on the wind, depends on a lot of factors.         The tour will not allow Bryson DeChambeau to bludgeon his way over the water at SawgrassIt was too much for the tournament organisers. Overnight, they placed that landing area out of bounds.\u2018In the interest of safety for spectators and other personnel,\u2019 was the official explanation. It was claimed DeChambeau could endanger the grandstands.What tosh. That shot, that anticipation, was exactly what spectators pay to see. Would he take it on? Would he pull it off? That\u2019s the thrill. And watch out. Everyone who attends golf knows that, too.\u00a0Even if DeChambeau led the way and several rivals tried to follow, it would only add to the drama for paying customers. Now they get to see 150 golfers play the same hole, the same way, some better than others. There are worse ways to spend an afternoon, but even so. Plenty of people are not interested in golf beyond the majors.\u00a0But if they were told DeChambeau was about to attempt a shot that was possibly beyond any other player in the world, that it might fail or succeed spectacularly \u2014 they would change channels. This is the moment the PGA outlawed.         Bryson DeChambeau's plan to tackle the 18th hole at Sawgrass has been preventedThere is precedent. At the 1979 US Open at Inverness Club, Toledo, Lon Hinkle \u2014 three wins on the PGA Tour, tied third at the PGA Championship and US Open in 1980 \u2014 devised a way to cut off the dogleg at eight by hitting on to the 17th fairway.He awoke for his second round to discover that, overnight, the USGA had planted a sizable tree in the vicinity of his landing space. He finished tied 53rd.Hinkle, though, was simply crafty. DeChambeau\u2019s schemes are box-office and game-changing. He is Kevin Pietersen switch-hitting or Cristiano Ronaldo making a free-kick travel through air, unlike any player in history. Imagine if rules stifled that? As a first-time visitor to the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa, I was advised to stand near Eau Rouge, back to the action, and listen.\u2018You\u2019ll hear when Michael Schumacher comes through.\u2019It was right. He sounded different. What he did, how he approached one of the great challenges in Formula One, was unique.DeChambeau has that quality. Why golf would wish to limit his spectacle at a time when it seeks audiences is a mystery.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Liverpool return to form in the Champions League as Mo Salah...

        "full article": "The police watchdog has launched an investigation into whether Metropolitan Police officers \u201cresponded appropriately\u201d to a report of indecent exposure following referrals linked to the arrest of the suspect in the Sarah Everard case. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said its independent probe follows a \u201cconduct referral\u201d from the force in relation to two officers, which was received on Wednesday night. This is linked to four other referrals, and all are connected to the arrest of the serving Metropolitan Police officer currently being held on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering 33-year-old Ms Everard and for a separate allegation of indecent exposure, the IOPC said. The IOPC said in a statement on Thursday night that its investigation will look at the actions of the Met after police received a report on February 28 that \u201ca man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in South London\u201d. It added: \u201cYesterday we determined that two conduct referrals relating to kidnap/murder and indecent exposure allegations against the arrested officer should remain under local investigation by the force. \u201cWe are still assessing a mandatory referral in relation to the actions of police after they received a report that Sarah Everard was missing.\u201d          The investigation has been launched by the IOPC (Kirsty O\u00b4Connor/PA)  The IOPC said a fifth mandatory referral was received from the Met on Thursday \u201cin relation to police contact with the arrested officer who was treated in hospital after sustaining a head injury while in custody yesterday afternoon\u201d. \u201cThat referral is also being assessed to determine what further action may be required from us,\u201d the watchdog added. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that, after the arrest of the officer, it made one \u201cmandatory\u201d and one \u201cvoluntary\u201d referral to the IOPC \u2013 both linked to the suspect\u2019s conduct \u2013 which the watchdog had determined should be locally investigated by the force. It said in a statement: \u201cA further voluntary referral was made for a conduct matter in relation to the police investigation into the separate allegations of indecent exposure. \u201cThe IOPC have determined this will be subject to an independent IOPC investigation.\u201d The Met said it awaited the IOPC\u2019s assessment of two other mandatory referrals in relation to police actions after Ms Everard was reported missing and after \u201cthe man arrested was taken to a hospital for treatment to a head injury sustained while in custody in a cell alone\u201d. \u201cHe was being monitored by CCTV and received immediate first aid,\u201d the force said, adding: \u201cWe are offering every assistance to the IOPC.\u201d",

After meeting United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Dubai, President Aleksandar Vucic said Serbian production capacity for the Sinopharm vaccine would be ready by Oct. 15. \"We will have large quantities of vaccine for us, but also for the entire region,\" Vucic said on state-run RTS TV. Vucic said within two weeks Serbia and the UAE would sign a deal covering the construction of a new vaccine factory. \"It will be an entirely ... new vaccine factory which we will build together with the UAE and the Chinese,\" he said. Also on Thursday, the office of Nenad Popovic, the minister for innovation, said Serbia plans to start local production of the Sputnik V vaccine from May 20. \"The first phase ... would include the transport of (vaccine) ingredients from Russia, packing and distribution,\" Popovic's office said after he met Russian trade minister Denis Manturov in Moscow. Serbia, which has a population of 7 million, has so far registered 503,291 cases of COVID-19 and 4,644 deaths. Under a state vaccination programme, Serbians can choose between shots made by Pfizer/BioNTech , Oxford AstraZeneca, Sinopharm and Sputnik V. Serbia has one the world\u00b4s highest vaccination rates behind the likes of Israel, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Britain.

State police have not said whether Laduca was armed. State police say the investigation so far indicates Laduca drove away as deputies patrolling Wednesday night in DeSoto tried to stop him. He led deputies on a chase into Red River Parish, where the Jeep Cherokee he was driving went through a barbed wire fence and got stuck in a ditch, according to the news release. Deputies from both parishes fired after a confrontation, the news release said. State police declined to release any more information when asked by email if Laduca was armed or if they have recovered a weapon. It was unclear why deputies tried to stop him in DeSoto Parish or why he refused to stop.",

That case is still pending.\u00a0\u00a0'Mr. Elmezayen conceived a cold-blooded plan to murder his autistic sons and their mother, then cash in on insurance policies,' said Acting United States Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison.

Elmezayen began purchasing the insurance policies the same year he exited a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.After taking out the policies, Elmezayen repeatedly called the insurance companies \u2013 sometimes pretending to be his ex-wife \u2013 to make sure that the policies were active and that they would pay benefits if his former spouse died in an accident.\u00a0Elmezayen also called at least two of the insurance companies to confirm they would not investigate claims made two years after the policies were purchased. These telephone calls were recorded and were played for the jury.On April 9, 2015, Elmezayen drove a car with his ex-wife, Rehab Diab, and his two severely autistic sons, 13-year-old Elhassan and 8-year-old Abdelkarim, off a wharf at the Port of Los Angeles. The site of the crash was a loading dock and worksite for commercial fishermen.

        "full article": "Champions find way. In their first match since being crowned kings of Scotland, Rangers dug deep for a result that might be of regal significance to their Europa League ambitions.For half-an-hour in the Sinobo Stadium, it looked as though Steven Gerrard\u2019s side were still nursing hangovers from the weekend title party. Sluggish, slovenly play pockmarked their performance.When they fell behind to Nicolae Stanciu\u2019s seventh minute strike, there was a danger of the situation quickly worsening. And maybe in past seasons it might have.         Rangers take a vital away goal into the second leg of their Europa League tie with Slavia Prague         Filip Helander tapped in from close range to bring Rangers level ten minutes before half-time         Nicolae Stanciu had opened the scoring in the seventh minute with a stunning finish   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       EXCLUSIVE: How do YOU want to fix this VAR mess?

Filip Helander claimed an equaliser before the break that flattered Rangers on the balance of first-half play. Come the second period, however, Gerrard\u2019s men stepped it up across every department.They got in Slavia\u2019s faces. They had chances to take the lead. And, right at the end, they departed with a hugely valuable draw thanks to a quite brilliant save from Allan McGregor. It was another addition to the ever-young 39-year-old\u2019s catalogue of outstanding European moments.The result leaves this contest for a quarter-final place perfectly poised ahead of next Thursday\u2019s second leg in Glasgow. If they can perform as they did after the interval, Rangers should feel capable of securing another landmark feat in Gerrard\u2019s tenure.Certainly, the Ibrox manager will feel satisfied with the fortitude shown following the immense emotional high of claiming the club\u2019s first title in a decade.Make no mistake, a draw here is creditable. Slavia\u2019s pedigree extends well beyond their superb victory over Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Leicester City in the previous round.

Indeed, no visiting side has won at this ground since Inter Milan triumphed back in November 2019.They set about showing why from the start. Pressing high and mixing it up between short and long passing, the hosts unsettled Rangers in what become a distinctly uncomfortable introduction.A couple of slips and misplaced passes suggested uncertainty in the Ibrox ranks. Then, in the seventh minute, came the early concession.Slavia seized control in midfield and switched play wide left for Peter Olayinka. The Nigerian rolled the ball back for Stanciu, who was given too much leeway to size up his options.It was time he put to good use. A beautiful, curling shot from near the angle of the area flew past the unsighted McGregor and found the far side of the net.Stanciu\u2019s finish was majestic. But it still felt like punishment for the sloppiness Rangers had exhibited.The shock of going behind wasn\u2019t enough to dispel it. When Stanciu played in Lucas Provod, an excellent sliding challenge from Connor Goldson was required to block the midfielder\u2019s left-foot strike. Goldson bounced back to his feet and roared in frustration at how easily the chance had been created.Gerrard\u2019s side couldn\u2019t get any real grip. Keeping the ball in Slavia\u2019s half was problematic. There was a danger of the deficit increasing.Borna Barisic was booked on 29 minutes for toppling Jan Kuchta after tumbling in a chase just outside the area. Provod took the free-kick and tried to catch McGregor at his near post, but the veteran threw himself left to make the save.Then Stanciu was gifted possession by a poor touch from young right-back Nathan Patterson, making just his second Europa League start. Again, the Romanian manoeuvred onto his right foot to unleash another curling effort. This time, though, his accuracy was marginally out.You suspected Gerrard would have taken 1-0 at half-time and a chance to reorganise from there. Instead, he had parity to work with after Rangers grabbed a 36th minute equaliser that stunned the previously dominant hosts.It was a strange goal. But no less valuable one for that. How the Ibrox men needed the lift it provided.Borna Barisic swept over a free-kick from the left that nicked the head of a Slavia defender before bouncing off Goldson\u2019s thigh and angling back across goal.Ianis Hagi had previously done little worthy of praise, yet he showed vital awareness here - reacting quickest to keep the ball in the ball in play with a precise cutback that removed goalkeeper Ondrej Kolar from the scenario. Helander had followed up and was rewarded with a close range tap-in.The Swede\u2019s celebration was doubtless mixed with a little relief. For Rangers, the question was whether they could raise their performance level to build upon the break.There was certainly more positive aggression shown after the break. Slavia were engaged with greater intent higher up the pitch. For the first time, the Czechs were having to answer different types of questions. Chances followed for the Ibrox men once the hour mark had passed.\u00a0         Steven Gerrard's side were much improved in the second half and deserved to claim a draw         Slavia missed a great chance right at the end as Allan McGregor produced a fantastic saveThe first arose when Alfredo Morelos broke into space on the right flank. He knocked it inside for Aribo but the Nigeria midfielder couldn\u2019t quite sort out his feet as a left-foot shot was sliced wide.\u00a0Aribo was becoming influential in his creation, though. A lovely glide towards the home penalty area was followed by him picking out Ryan Kent.The \u00a37m million slightly mis-hit his shot but it threatened to loop over Kolar before the goalkeeper thrust up a hand to tip it away.Rangers were on top now. By some distance, it was their best spell of the game. It could, and should, have led to them taking the lead on 67 minutes.A Barisic free-kick was once more the outlet. A fabulous delivery from the left looked inch-perfect for Goldson\u2019s run but the centre-back couldn\u2019t connect as the ball flashed in front of him. Any solid contact and you wouldn\u2019t have fancied Kolar\u2019s chances.You always fancy McGregor\u2019s chances. The veteran goalkeeper had to stretch to concede a 90th minute corner.Slavia substitute Lukas Masopust connected with a perfect downward header that was destined for the bottom corner of the net. McGregor, though, got down to not only stop it with his left hand but somehow retain the ball on the line. It was simply sensational.

        "full article": "Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask will not compete in Thursday's game against the New York Rangers due to a back injury, coach Bruce Cassidy announced. Rask has been idle since appearing to tweak his back late in Boston's 1-0 loss to the New Jersey Devils on Sunday. The former Vezina Trophy recipient remains one win shy of 300 for his career. \"We thought it was something minor after Jersey, late in the game, but it's lingered,\" Cassidy said on Thursday. \"So (he's) not on the ice today, can't really give you much of an update until he gets back on the ice. He was in this morning feeling better but not well enough to play tonight or practice, so we'll see where he's at tomorrow.\" Jaroslav Halak will start against the Rangers. Rask, who turned 34 on Wednesday, sports an 8-4-2 record with a 2.46 goals-against average and .906 save percentage in 14 games (all starts) this season. He is playing in the final season of an eight-year, $56 million contract. Rask owns a 299-162-66 record with 50 shutouts, a 2.27 GAA and .921 save percentage in 550 career games (530 starts) with the Bruins. He has been with the Bruins' organization since June 2006 and made his NHL debut in 2007. He was a first-round draft pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2005. --Field Level Media",

Qudus Wahab contributed 17 points, Jahvon Blair added 14 and Jamorko Pickett had 12 for the Hoyas (11-12), who await the winner between Seton Hall and St. John's. Jeremiah Robinson-Earl led Villanova (16-6) with 26 points and Jermaine Samuels added 20. Justin Moore, who finished with 10 points, had been doubtful for the tournament with a sprained left ankle. Blair made a 3-pointer with 5:09 remaining to cap a 13-1 run and give Georgetown a 63-62 lead. Cole Swider's trey with the shot clock winding down and 2:13 left gave Villanova a 67-65 advantage. After an empty Georgetown possession, Robinson-Earl followed with a 3-pointer and the lead was five. Wahab's three-point play with 40 seconds remaining tied the game at 70. Robinson-Earl sank a free throw with 19 seconds left before Harris made two for the win. Blair connected on consecutive 3-pointers to give Georgetown a 19-17 lead with 9:52 remaining in the first half. Samuels, however, came back with a pair of treys to propel Villanova to a 27-22 advantage. But Pickett responded with a 3-pointer from the corner with 5:52 left to pull the Hoyas within 27-25. Georgetown led 37-35 at halftime, thanks in large part to 10 points from Wahab. Samuels paced the Wildcats with 14 points, but the team missed 16 of 19 treys in the opening half. Chris Arcidiacono was fouled on a 3-pointer early in the second and knocked down all three shots to give a Villanova a 40-39 lead. Moore soon followed with a trey from wing with 17:43 remaining to give the Wildcats a 43-39 advantage. A layup by Robinson-Earl and a driving basket by Moore pushed the lead to 47-39. When Harris dropped in a jumper with 13:49 to go, the Hoyas cut the deficit to 49-46. But Villanova scored the next six points to move back ahead by nine. Moore received a crisp pass from Arcidiacono and hit a trey with 8:49 left for a 61-50 Villanova advantage. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By Humeyra Pamuk and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday condemned Chinese moves to change Hong Kong's electoral system and forecast \"difficult\" talks with Beijing's top diplomats next week, when the genocide Washington says China is committing against minority Muslims will be an issue the U.S. side plans to raise. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan would not hold back when they meet with the Chinese diplomats in Alaska on March 18 and 19, \"whether it's on Taiwan, or ... efforts to push back democracy in Hong Kong, or on concerns we have about the economic relationship.\" \"Addressing the genocide against Uighur Muslims is something that will be a topic of discussion with the Chinese directly next week,\" she added. In response, China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, urged the United States on Friday to stop interfering in China's affairs, including Hong Kong. \"China hopes both sides can focus on cooperation and manage differences,\" he said, adding that both sides should understand each others' policy intention correctly. China rejects U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against Uighur and other Muslims in its Xinjiang region and calls criticism of its behavior toward Hong Kong and self-ruled Taiwan unwarranted interference in its internal affairs. China's parliament on Thursday approved a draft decision to change Hong Kong's electoral system, further reducing democratic representation in the city's institutions and introducing a mechanism to vet politicians' loyalty to Beijing. State Department spokesman Ned Price called the changes \"a direct attack on Hong Kong\u00b4s autonomy, its freedoms and democratic processes.\" \"There will be some difficult conversations I would expect,\" he said, referring to the talks Blinken and Sullivan plan to hold in Anchorage with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councillor Wang Yi, the first high-level in-person contacts between the two sparring countries under the Biden administration. {nL1N2L825Q] Price said Washington would explore areas for cooperation with China where it was in the U.S. interest, including climate change, but called on Beijing to change if it wanted to improve the frayed relationship. \"We're not looking to engage in talks for the sake of talks,\" he said. \"We are looking for Beijing ... to demonstrate that seriousness of purpose, to demonstrate that it seeks to live up to its own oft-stated desire to change the tone of the bilateral relationship.\" President Joe Biden's administration has committed to reviewing elements of U.S. policies toward China, as the world's two largest economies navigate relations that sank to their lowest depths in decades during Donald Trump's presidency. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a \"disaster\" for both nations. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that China and the United States had common interests and many areas for cooperation and that Beijing hoped ties could develop in a healthy way based on respecting each other's core interests, win-win cooperation and non-interference in internal affairs.

        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - For years, researchers have said a lack of diversity in Hollywood films doesn\u00b4t just poorly reflect demographics, it\u00b4s bad business. A new study by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates just how much Hollywood is leaving on the table: $10 billion. The McKinsey report, released Thursday, analyzes how inequality shapes the industry and how much it ultimately costs its bottom line. The consulting firm deduced that the $148 billion film and TV industry loses $10 billion, or 7%, every year by undervaluing Black films, filmmakers and executives. \"Fewer Black-led stories get told, and when they are, these projects have been consistently underfunded and undervalued, despite often earning higher relative returns than other properties,\" wrote the study\u00b4s authors: Jonathan Dunn, Sheldon Lyn, Nony Onyeador and Ammanuel Zegeye. The study, spanning the years 2015-2019, was conducted over the last six months and drew on earlier research by the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Southern California and Nielsen. The BlackLight Collective, a coalition of Black executives and talent in the industry, collaborate with McKinsey researchers. The company also interviewed more than 50 executives, producers, agents, actors, directors and writers anonymously. McKinsey attributed at least some of Hollywood's slow progress to its complex and multi-layered business - an ecosystem of production companies, networks, distributors, talent agencies and other separate but intertwined realms. But the lack of Black representation in top positions of power plays a prominent role. The study found that 92% of film executives are white and 87% are in television. Agents and executives at the top three talent agencies are approximately 90% white - and a striking 97% among partners.

A new study by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates just how much Hollywood is leaving on the table: $10 billion. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File)  Researchers found that films with a Black lead or co-lead are budgeted 24% less than movies that don't - a disparity that nearly doubles when there are two or more Black people working as director, producer or writer. Among other measures, McKinsey recommends that a \"well-funded, third-party organization\" be created for a more comprehensive approach to racial equality. The film business, it said, is less diverse than industries such as energy, finance and transport. Following the Black Lives Matter protests last year, McKinsey said it would dedicate $200 million to pro-bono work to advance racial equality.

        "full article": "Raila Odinga is a popular politician despite losing four presidential challenges  Kenya's veteran opposition leader and former prime minister Raila Odinga, 76, is in hospital with Covid-19, his doctor said Thursday. Odinga checked into hospital on Tuesday claiming fatigue, and his doctor David Oluoch-Olunya confirmed in a statement he had tested positive for Covid-19, but was \"responding well to treatment\" and \"remains upbeat\". Kenya is currently experiencing the start of a third wave of Covid infections, with an average positivity rate of almost 13 percent this week. On Wednesday 12 people died, the highest number in one day this year. Both the South African and UK variants of the virus have been detected in the country. Kenya has recorded over 110,000 Covid-19 cases and 1,899 deaths, and began vaccinating against the virus last week. The country has been under some form of evening curfew for almost a year. Odinga has been a mainstay of Kenyan politics since the 1980s, and remains hugely popular despite losing four shots at the presidency. His loss in 2017 elections, which he claimed were rigged, led to political unrest which left more than 90 people dead. The Supreme Court shocked the nation by ordering a rerun due to irregularities, which Odinga boycotted and President Uhuru Kenyatta won, deepening a political crisis. However since then the country's political landscape has completely altered. In early 2018 Kenyatta and Odinga shook hands and pledged unity, joining forces and effectively leaving Kenya without an opposition. The pair have criss-crossed the country holding massive rallies -- despite Covid restrictions -- pushing for a referendum on a raft of constitutional reforms, notably to bring back the position of prime minister before 2022 polls. Kenyatta and Odinga say the measures will ease the scourge of election-related political violence in the country. However suspicions are high Odinga is being lined up as successor to Kenyatta, who cannot seek a third term. Meanwhile deputy president William Ruto, who had been promised Kenyatta's backing for the top job in 2022 in exchange for his support in the past two elections, has been publicly, and bitterly, sidelined. The political triangle has gripped the country with election fever and rallies -- even though the vote is 18 months away. Odinga also ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1997, 2007 and 2013. His loss in 2007 triggered widespread politically motivated tribal violence that left more than 1,100 dead. A political deal to stop the violence saw him take up the specially created position of prime minister until 2013.",

        "full article": "When departing Sunrise host Sam Armytage and wunderkind executive producer Michael Pell held hands and posed for selfies at her farewell lunch\u00a0on Thursday afternoon, they knew they were sending a powerful message to their critics.For months there had been rumours the once-close friends had fallen out, and media insiders took notice when Sam did not mention\u00a0Michael in her parting message to viewers earlier that morning - although she had thanked him while announcing her resignation on Monday - and saw this as a sign relations were still frosty.However, they shut down the gossip by cuddling up at Catalina Restaurant in Rose Bay, during a celebratory gathering with several high-profile Seven staffers.But how did they heal their rift?         Friends again: Departing Sunrise host Sam Armytage appears to have healed her rift with the show's executive producer, Michael Pell. Pictured at the races several years agoRumours of Sam and Michael's falling out were no secret in media circles.

What feud? For months there had been rumours the once-close friends had fallen out, but Sam and Michael embraced at her farewell lunch in Rose Bay on Thursday afternoonHe also reported in December that this worsening of relations was a sign Sam would soon depart Sunrise - a prediction later proved correct, even though Sam publicly denied it at the time.Before their rift, Sam and Michael had been close friends for years.They would hang out socially, attend the races arm in arm, and pop up on each other's social media accounts.         Scrutiny: Rumours of their falling out were no secret in media circles. Their supposed feud had been gossip fodder for The Sydney Morning Herald's Private Sydney column for months. Michael is pictured on Sunrise in November with hosts Sam and David 'Kochie' Koch (right)Their close bond was unsurprising: Michael was the man who hired Sam to host Sunrise - Australia's number-one breakfast show - and was also one of her most staunch defenders against criticism in the press.His defence of Sam on Twitter became more muted last year - perhaps because of their reported rift - but he was back to his old ways on Thursday when News.com.au suggested Sam had omitted him from her farewell speech.He posted a selfie of the pair at\u00a0Catalina and wrote, 'Hey @newscomauHQ... lunch going well. Feud not so much.'Sam and Michael will likely never acknowledge their rift, but it seems her departure from Sunrise after eight years has allowed them to put their differences aside.         Claims: There were reports the Sunrise boss, 37, had become 'frustrated' with 44-year-old Sam's 'cavalier' approach to her critics. Pictured together at Sam's send-off on Thursday         Pals: In a telling sign they've let bygones be bygones, TV Blackbox reports that Sam was 'upset' by the suggestion she had 'snubbed' Michael in her farewell speech.

        "full article": "A toxic dead sea slug has blended into in a seemingly innocent photo of an Australian beach - prompting authorities to issue an urgent public safety warning.Shire of Augusta-Margaret River in Western Australia's south-west have reported an abnormally high number of large sea hares washing up along the local coastline.The toxic slugs look like any other rock littered across the sand but have a putrid smell and are particularly dangerous to pets, the council said.But worryingly, they often blend into the beach scene thanks to looking remarkably similar to a rock.\u00a0         This seemingly innocent photo of a Western Australian beach shows a toxic dead sea slug hiding among the rocksThe shire's co-ordinator of landcare/environment John McKinney said partially decomposed animals commonly appear on the region's beaches in late summer.But he added this year had seen dead slugs being washed ashore every night regardless of fluctuations in the tides and weather.'The shire understands that in certain circumstances some species of sea hares can be toxic to dogs and has erected signage at key locations throughout Augusta to advise dog owners to be vigilant,' he told NCA NewsWire.\u00a0   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       What IS that? Squirming Blob-like sea creature washes up on...    'What is THIS?' Mysterious 'alien-like' creature leaves...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n The state's Department of Primary Development and Regional Development said decomposing fish can contain dangerous levels of bacteria.'Anyone who has handled dead or dying fish and experiences any inflammation on their hands around any cuts or abrasions should see a doctor,' the department said.Mr McKinney said the slugs were being left strewn across the beach by authorities because there are too many of them to clean up.         The toxic bacteria-containing slugs smell bad and are particularly dangerous to pets, Shire of Augusta-Margaret River council saidThe environmental expert said the fact the animal was washing up daily also made the job of removing them from the beach more difficult.He added algal blooms - a rapid accumulation of algae - were producing a potent fishy smell along the coast and also should not be eaten by pets.\u00a0Samples of the animals\u00a0have been taken away for analysis. WHAT ARE SEA HARES?\u00a0Sea hares are a type of large sea slug that have a soft body and a small internal shell they use for swimming in the ocean.They feed on algae and usually live for about a year by sliding over rocks they pass.\u00a0Hares can reach up to 20cm in length and can camouflage themselves easily on beaches and rocky coastlines.\u00a0They are found across Australia in parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.During summer, their eggs are released as spaghetti-like strings.\u00a0Source: Australian Museum\u00a0 Advertisement",

        "title": "Lighter Garcia proving his worth in crowded Brewers outfield",
        "full article": "Milwaukee\u00b4s Avisa\u00edl Garc\u00eda admits he was a little surprised at first when he learned the Brewers were adding Jackie Bradley Jr. to a crowded outfield competition. A discussion with manager Craig Counsell helped Garcia understand the logic in the move and how it could assist him. \"We\u00b4re good,\" Garc\u00eda said Thursday from the Brewers\u00b4 spring training camp in Phoenix. \"I get it.\" The addition of Bradley, announced Monday, gave the Brewers four former All-Stars for three outfield positions. Center fielder Lorenzo Cain is back after opting out of most of the 2020 season, though he\u00b4s been slowed by a quadriceps injury, and 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich is set in left field. Counsell hasn\u00b4t indicated how he will divide playing time. He understood Garcia\u00b4s initial surprise about the Bradley signing and said the 29-year-old handled it well. \"He was a true professional,\" Counsell said of Garc\u00eda. \"That\u00b4s the way I\u00b4d describe it. He was concerned and rightfully so. I think that\u00b4s fair. But the way we\u00b4re looking at this is there\u00b4s at-bats to go around. I think it will keep everybody really productive. I don\u00b4t see this as having a fourth outfielder. I see this as four outfielders.\"          Milwaukee Brewers' Avisail Garcia leads off from first base during the fourth inning of a spring training baseball game against the Chicago Cubs Saturday, March 6, 2021, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)  Garc\u00eda, who made the All-Star Game in 2017 with the Chicago White Sox, has shown he\u00b4s intent on bouncing back from a subpar 2020 season. He said at the start of the camp that he weighed 235 and had dropped almost 36 pounds from where he\u00b4d been at one point. Garc\u00eda, who is 6-foot-4, says he played at about 257 pounds last season and believes the weight loss has improved his speed and energy level. \"I think Avi\u00b4s optimism for the season just shows up by the way he showed up to camp,\" Counsell said. \"He clearly worked very, very hard and put a lot into his preparations this winter. That was in the weight room and it was in the cages. He\u00b4s put a lot of work in. He\u00b4s getting great feedback from that work so far.\" Indeed, Garc\u00eda went 7 of 14 with two homers in his first six Cactus League games. \"I\u00b4m not giving up any at-bats,\" Garc\u00eda said. \"I\u00b4m trying to work the counts, try to see good pitches to hit and do my best every day, no matter what statistics I have. Spring training or whatever, I\u00b4m here to play and I\u00b4m ready.\" Garc\u00eda batted just .238 with two homers and 15 RBIs in 53 games in his first season the Brewers last year after hitting .282 with 20 homers and 72 RBIs in 125 games for Tampa Bay in 2019. Garc\u00eda, normally a right fielder, spent much of last season playing center after Cain opted out. Brewers hitting coach Andy Haines visited Garcia\u00b4s Miami home during the offseason as they tried figuring out how to improve upon that 2020 performance. \"I\u00b4m focused on using my hips, trying to have balance and be early (at the plate),\" Garc\u00eda said. \"When I\u00b4m early, I have a really good chance to hit the ball hard. That\u00b4s what we\u00b4re working on. Be early, be on time and be loose. Don\u00b4t try to do too much.\" Garc\u00eda isn\u00b4t speculating how many games he may end up playing this season. But he appreciates how the Brewers are adding more talent. \"Hopefully if everybody stays healthy, everybody can play a lot of games,\" Garcia said. \"There\u00b4s a lot of things that can happen during the season. I don\u00b4t know. The only thing I want is for everybody to stay healthy. That\u00b4s the best. If everybody stays healthy, I think we will have a special team.\" That\u00b4s the message Counsell is sending to each of his outfielders. \"I\u00b4ve told all of them that the problem we want is that you all are playing so well that we\u00b4ve got issues trying to figure out who\u00b4s going to play,\" Counsell said. \"I can guarantee if that\u00b4s the case, there will be a lot of wins on the board, we\u00b4ll be sitting in a pretty good spot and understand there\u00b4s a real big purpose ahead of us.\" ___ Follow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee ___ More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB          Milwaukee Brewers right fielder Avisail Garcia (24) scores on a single by Milwaukee Brewers shortstop Orlando Arcia during the second inning of a spring training baseball game against the Chicago Cubs Saturday, March 6, 2021, in Phoenix.

        "full article": "Iverson Molinar made two free throws with 7.1 seconds left and ninth-seeded Mississippi State hung on for a 74-73 win over Kentucky on Thursday afternoon in the second round of the SEC tournament in Nashville. The Bulldogs won despite losing a 15-point lead in the second half. Molinar scored 12 of his team's final 14 points and finished with 21 points. No. 8 seed Kentucky had a chance to win and got an open look from Dontaie Allen, but the 3-point attempt bounced off the back rim and the final buzzer sounded inside Bridgestone Arena. The Bulldogs (15-13) advance to play top-seeded Alabama in the quarterfinals on Friday. Kentucky finishes 9-16 and will miss the NCAA Tournament for the first time since the 2008-2009 season. The Wildcats trailed 51-36 with 17:44 to play in the game, then caught fire. Kentucky made 51.7 percent of its second-half shots and 7 of 14 from 3-point range. Allen made five 3s in the second half on his way to a team-high 23 points. Down 62-53 with 10:43 to play, Kentucky proceeded to go on a 9-0 run to tie the game. Davion Mintz knocked down a 3-pointer with 4:30 left, giving Kentucky a 71-66 lead. But the Bulldogs didn't wilt. Molinar hit back-to-back 3s to put Mississippi State back in front 72-71, then made the two clutch free throws. Tolu Smith had 13 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulldogs. Olivier Sarr added 14 for the Wildcats, whose 15-game winning streak against Mississippi State came to an end. The Bulldogs shot 57.6 percent in the first half on their way to a 44-30 halftime lead, as Kentucky looked headed for an embarrassing early exit.

        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. coach Jason Kreis learned only Thursday that fans will be allowed at 25% capacity to attend Olympic men's soccer qualifying in Guadalajara, Mexico, where the Americans open against Costa Rica on March 18 after a one year delay. \"It seems a little bit odd timing,\" he said of the decision, \"because we knew there\u00b4s difficulties of having fans come from the United States with only one week notice. But when we look at it from the bright side and say let\u00b4s get it out there ASAP and let\u00b4s get some of our fans down here to support us, we\u00b4ll hopefully be able to jump though that hoop and make that happen.\" Norwich forward Sebastian Soto and midfielders Johnny Cardoso of Internacional, Ulysses Llanez of Heerenveen and Sebastian Saucedo of Pumas headed a 20-man U.S. roster. The delay has U.S. coaches and training staff trying to work their players back into shape. \"We have a lot less match fitness,\" Kreis said. \"I feel like we\u00b4ve kind of entered this this training period starting on March 1 with a lot of players that haven\u00b4t played a match since last year I think October, a lot of these guys.\" Sixteen players are from Major League Soccer, a reflection of FIFA rules that do not require teams to release players for Olympic qualifying or the Olympics, which this year is limited to players 24 years old and under. Among the top U.S. players not included were Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams, Gio Reyna, Josh Sargent, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, Chris Richards, Antonee Robinson, Matthew Hoppe, Owen Otasowie, Yunas Musah and Nicholas Gioacchini. The U.S. is trying to qualify after missing the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. The senior U.S. national team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. \"I just think it\u00b4s important for U.S. Soccer to continue to lay down markers -- under 17, under 20, under 23, we need to continue to lay down markers that we are a dominant team in this region,\" Kreis said. \"And so, yeah, I do believe that this is an important moment for us to continue on that path, to continue to change people\u00b4s opinions about our national team programs.\" Kreis cut 11 players from his training camp roster, including three Atlanta players whose clubs refused to release them: defenders George Bello and Miles Robinson, and forward Brooks Lennon. Also cut Thursday were: Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender; defenders Marco Farfan of Los Angeles and Austin Trusty of Colorado; midfielders Frankie Amaya of Cincinnati, Cole Bassett of Colorado, Tanner Tessmann of Dallas and Eryk Williamson of Portland; and Dallas forward Ricardo Pepi. Twelve of the players were on the roster that was to have competed in the qualifying tournament in March 2020 before the delay caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic: Ullanez and Saucedo; goalkeepers Matt Freese, JT Marcinkowski and David Ochoa; defenders Justen Glad and Aaron Herrera; midfielders Hassani Dotson, Djordje Mihailovic, and Jackson Yueill; and forwards Jesus Ferreira and Jonathan Lewis. The eight on the roster last year who are not now included defenders Reggie Cannon (Portugal\u00b4s Boavista), Chris Gloster (the Netherlands\u00b4 PSV Eindhoven), Mark McKenzie (Belgium\u00b4s Genk) and Erik Palmer-Brown (Austria Vienna), and midfielder Brenden Aaronson (Red Bull Salzburg), who are with European clubs. PSV Eindhoven midfielder Richie Ledezma tore an ACL in December and Dallas midfielder Paxton Pomykal is recovering from hip surgery in September to repair his labrum. Portland forward Jeremy Ebobisse was dropped after Kreis concluded during a January training camp that he was more of a central player, where he was behind on the depth chart, and not a winger. Three players are with Salt Lake, and two each from Colorado, Orlando and San Jose. Eleven players have appeared for the senior U.S. national team but for a total of 37 appearances. The group is topped by Yueill with nine, followed by Lewis (seven), Mihailovic (six), Llanez and Sam Vines (three apiece), Cardoso, Ferreira and Soto (two each), and Julian Araujo, Herrera and Andr\u00e9s Perea (one apiece). Kreis said he may use different goalkeepers in the first two matches and said he may emphasize MLS experience, which would give Ochoa an edge. Llanez and Saucedo were listed as midfielders instead of forwards. The U.S. is in Group A of the North and Central American and Caribbean qualifying tournament. The Americans play the Dominican Republic on March 21 and complete Group A on March 24 against host Mexico. The other CONCACAF group includes Canada, El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras. The top two teams in each group advance, and the semifinal winners on March 28 qualify for the Olympics. Following the pandemic-caused postponement, FIFA kept the same eligibility rules that were first established, saying players must be born after Jan. 1, 1997. For the 16 nations reaching the Olympics, each may include three players over the age limit. CONCACAF qualifiers will join Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Ivory Coast, Japan, New Zealand, Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and Spain. The tournament will be played from July 21 to Aug. 7 in Tokyo, Kashima, Miyagi, Saitama, Sapporo and Yokohama. The roster: Goalkeepers: Matt Freese (Philadelphia), JT Marcinkowski (San Jose), David Ochoa (Salt Lake) Defenders: Julian Araujo (LA Galaxy), Justen Glad (Salt Lake), Aaron Herrera (Salt Lake), Henry Kessler (New England), Mauricio Pineda (Chicago), Sam Vines (Colorado) Midfielders: Johnny Cardoso (Internacional, Brazil), Hassani Dotson (Minnesota), Ulysses Llanez (Heerenveen, Netherlands), Djordje Mihailovic (Montreal), Andr\u00e9s Perea (Orlando), Sebastian Saucedo (Pumas, Mexico), Jackson Yueill (San Jose) Forwards: Jesus Ferreira (Dallas), Jonathan Lewis (Colorado), Benji Michel (Orlando), Sebastian Soto (Norwich, England). ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "full article": "Reece Beekman hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer for his only points of the game, and top-seeded Virginia survived with a 72-69 win over eight-seed Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament in Greensboro, N.C., on Thursday. Beekman was 0-for-5 from the field until he took a pass from Kihei Clark and made just his ninth 3-pointer of the season, from the right wing, to send the Cavaliers (18-6) to a third straight win. Joey Hauser scored 14 of his 21 points in the second half and Jay Huff had 13 with 12 rebounds for No. 16 Virginia, which trailed by as many as 11 in the first half before shooting 46.2 percent in the second half. Buddy Boeheim had a career-high 31 points on 10-of-17 shooting for Syracuse (16-9). The Orange had won three in a row, but now must await their NCAA Tournament fate. After Boeheim's 3-pointer tied the game at 59, Trey Murphy III (15 points) knocked down one of his own with 3:34 left to give Virginia a lead that eventually reached six with 2:07 to play. However, Boeheim scored six of the game's next 10 points to tie things at 69-69 with less than 30 seconds remaining in the game. Syracuse led 37-26 with just over six minutes left in the first half. However, Virginia finally found its form to go on a 16-2 run that spanned halftime. The Cavaliers closed the first half on a 6-0 run to trail by three at the break. Murphy opened the second half with a 3-pointer and Hauser's following long-distance bucket with 17:52 to play gave the Cavaliers their first lead at 42-39. The Orange snapped a scoring drought of more than six minutes with Boeheim's off-balanced basket with 17:19 to go to trigger a back-and-forth run to the finish. Syracuse scored the first seven points of the game, with Boeheim responsible for five of them. The junior guard made his first three 3-pointers and Robert Braswell (10 points) connected on his first four shot attempts, including two from distance. The Orange shot 43.3 percent over the first 20 minutes, but went the final 3:57 without a point. Virginia, meanwhile, got a three-point play from Huff and a 3-pointer from Hauser to cut its deficit to 39-36 by the break, despite shooting 3-of-16 from distance over the first 20 minutes. Quincy Guerrier added 14 points and 10 rebounds for Syracuse. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - LG Energy Solution says it will invest more than $4.5 billion in its U.S. battery production business by 2025 as automakers ramp up production of electric vehicles. The Korean company, which has a joint venture with U.S. automaker General Motors, said the investment will help create 10,000 jobs, including subcontractors. GM and LG are currently building a $2.3 billion battery factory in Lordstown, Ohio, near Cleveland, that will employ about 1,000 people when it is completed in 2022. The site is fairly close to GM\u00b4s two other designated electric vehicle plants, one in Detroit and the other north of the city in Orion Township, Michigan. The companies hope to have a decision on a second site in the first half of the year. General Motors has changed its corporate logo and launched an electric vehicle marketing campaign to reshape its image as clean vehicle company, rather than a builder of gas-powered pickups and SUVs. The 112-year-old Detroit automaker has promised to roll out 30 new battery-powered vehicles globally by the end of 2025 and said Friday that the new campaign will highlight its progressive vision for the future. GM is likely to need far more battery capacity if it\u00b4s able to deliver on a goal of converting all of its new passenger vehicles from internal combustion engines to electricity by 2035. The consulting firm LMC Automotive predicts that U.S. battery powered vehicle sales will hit over 1 million per year starting in 2023, reaching over 4 million by 2030. Industry analysts have said that automakers face a global shortage of batteries as the industry moves away from gasoline powered vehicles. Most of the world\u00b4s batteries are built in China and other countries. LG's investment also comes as the President Joe Biden's administration has laid out its plans to tackle climate change which will likely include taking on oil and gas industry. \"The goals of the U.S. president and automakers will be a propelling factor in the growth of the country\u00b4s electric vehicle and energy storage systems markets,\" said Jong Hyun Kim, CEO of LG Energy Solution. \"LG Energy Solution is dedicated to expanding its battery production capacity and structuring a stable, localized supply chain that provides everything from R&D to production.\" LG also makes batteries for Chevy's electric Bolt.",

        "full article": "READING, Pa. (AP) - The state of Pennsylvania will pay $475,000 to the estate of a man who died underneath a bulldozer that Pennsylvania State Police had used to chase him for growing a handful of marijuana plants, according to a settlement revealed in court Thursday. Gregory Longenecker, a 51-year-old short-order cook and Grateful Dead fan, had fled into thick brush after being caught growing 10 marijuana plants on public land near Reading. His body was found under the treads of a Pennsylvania Game Commission bulldozer that state police had commandeered in pursuit. The lawsuit by Longenecker\u00b4s family contended that state police and the game commission took \"crazy and lethal action\" against an unarmed man who posed no threat, then destroyed or withheld evidence to cover it up. The plaintiffs' attorney, Jordan Strokovsky, said outside court Thursday that Longenecker's family is pleased with the settlement but wants \"sweeping reforms to prevent such an excessive show of force and tragedy like this in the future.\" A federal judge is reviewing the settlement and is expected to sign off. A prosecutor who investigated Longenecker\u00b4s death concluded that troopers acted reasonably. Authorities have publicly contended that Longenecker was high on methamphetamine, crawled under the back of the bulldozer when it stopped briefly, and was crushed to death when it started moving again and made a left turn. The lawsuit called that explanation ludicrous, and witness statements cast doubt on the official version of how he got caught under the machine. Strokovsky demanded an investigation by the state attorney general\u00b4s office, accusing the Berks County district attorney\u00b4s office and state police of misleading the public. \"Rather than admit what happened and apologize for their excessive tactics ... state police, with the assistance of the Berks County district attorney's office, disregarded evidence and provided a ridiculous and unfounded conclusion\" to show that \"law enforcement did nothing wrong,\" Strokovsky said. Berks County District Attorney John Adams said his office stands by its investigation, \"and to date we have not been provided with any evidence contrary to our investigative findings.\" The settlement did not require the state agencies to admit wrongdoing. A state police corporal who rode the bulldozer and a game commission worker who operated it remain on the job.",

There were also an additional eight productions in rehearsals that were preparing to open in the spring.Producers of the Broadway musical 'Mean Girls' said in January they have decided not to restart when authorities allow theaters to reopen in New York City.\u00a0In May last year, the big budget Disney musical 'Frozen' also decided not to reopen when Broadway theaters restart, marking the first time an established show had been felled by the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some scheduled spring 2020 shows \u2014 like a musical about Michael Jackson and a revival of Neil Simon's 'Plaza Suite' starring Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker \u2014 pushed their productions to 2021.\u00a0But others abandoned their plans, including 'Hangmen' and a revival of Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'At least 97,000 people worked in various theater-related jobs pre pandemic.\u00a0Cuomo said earlier this month New York will finally loosen restrictions on private gatherings and clear the way for some public performances that have been banned for nearly a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0Arts and entertainment venues will be allowed to open at a third of their capacity and welcome up to 100 people indoors and up to 200 people outdoors starting April 2.\u00a0\u00a0         Producers of the Broadway musical 'Mean Girls' said in January they have decided not to restart when authorities allow theaters to reopen in New York City         The Helen Hayes Theater at 240 W 44th St, New York, NY, remains closed and dark         The St. James Theater is pictured in September last year\u00a0Limits would be slightly higher \u2014 150 people indoors and 500 outdoors \u2014 if venues can implement a system in which attendees show proof of a recent, negative COVID-19 test before entering.The Democrat said the limit for outdoor private gatherings at people's homes will rise from 10 to 25 starting March 22.Cuomo cited improvements in the daily count of new coronavirus cases since January and the rollout of the vaccine as justification for loosening restrictions.\u00a0But live theater is uniquely tested by the virus, one reason it will be among the last sectors to return to normal.\u00a0Props and costumes are usually touched by dozens each night, an orchestra is crammed into a pit, backstage areas are small and shared, and audiences are usually packed into seats.\u00a0New York City's cinemas reopened earlier this month.\u00a0 The Big Apple's movie theaters resumed operations for the first time since March 17 last year, when officials ordered them shut as Covid-19 began ravaging America's commercial capital.They have been allowed to operate at 25 percent capacity - or with no more than 50 people per screen - from March 5.\u00a0\u00a0Madison Square Garden also welcomed back some NBA and NHL fans.",

        "full article": "March 11 (Reuters) - Roger Federer's hopes of winning a fourth title in Qatar were dashed after Wednesday's quarter-final exit but the Swiss said his first event after two knee surgeries was just a \"stepping stone\" as he targeted full fitness for the grasscourt season. Federer took the opening set against Nikoloz Basilashvili before the Georgian fought back to win 3-6 6-1 7-5, ending the 39-year-old Swiss' challenge at the tournament -- his first event in 14 months. \"I'm actually happy that I was able to play back-to-back three-set matches against top players. That's an important step forward to me,\" Federer, who beat Dan Evans in the last-16, told reporters. \"Like I said, I'm not 100% yet. I can feel it, I can see it. From that standpoint, (what's) important is to be 100% by the grasscourt season... I'm still building up. \"So this is a stepping stone. I'm actually happy how I felt today on court overall.\" Federer initially eyed a return at last month's Australian Open but slow progress in his recovery convinced him to skip the Grand Slam and he said he would play in events which would help him regain his fitness before Wimbledon. Tied with Rafa Nadal on 20 Grand Slam wins, Federer has won Wimbledon eight times. \"We've just got to take a real good look at the schedule and... see how much workload the body and knee can still take, what's the best way to prepare for basically the beginning of the season for me, which is the grasscourt season,\" he added. Federer also said he had not yet decided if he would play in Dubai, an ATP 500 event which begins on Sunday. \"I'll decide probably in the next 24 hours,\" he said.

        "full article": "By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen March 11 (Reuters) - Grab Holdings Inc is in talks to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company that could value the ride-hailing giant at nearly $40 billion, making it the largest ever blank-check deal, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day SoftBank-backed Grab was in talks with Altimeter Capital Management LP. (https://bit.ly/3rD4XR6) Grab is expected to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion from private investors, according to the report. Reuters first reported in January, citing sources, that Singapore-based Grab was exploring a listing in the United States. Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Altimeter has backed two SPACs - Altimeter Growth Corp and Altimeter Growth Corp 2. The WSJ report did not specify which of the two SPACs Grab was in talks with. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are shell companies that raise funds through an initial public offering to take a private company public. Other recent large SPAC deals include UMW Holdings Corp's $16-billion merger with a blank-check firm backed by billionaire Alec Gores, and the $24-billion deal that luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors struck with a Michael Klein-backed SPAC. Altimeter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Grab could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours.

The 8th District Court of Appeals in its ruling dismissed an appeal by the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, finding that the police union failed to timely serve Cleveland city attorneys with its application to overturn an arbitrator's decision on Timothy Loehmann's firing, cleveland.com reported. Loehmann wasn't fired in October 2016 for killing Tamir at a Cleveland recreation center in 2014, but rather for lying on his application to become a Cleveland police officer. He was fired in October 2016. Tamir was killed in November 2014, sparking outrage and protests. Cleveland paid $6 million to his family to settle a lawsuit. Union president Jeff Follmer said the case will be appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court. \"It\u00b4s disappointing that the decision wasn\u00b4t on the merits of the appeal,\" Follmer said. \"We feel that the city was notified correctly.

The Times Union of Albany reported on Wednesday that an unidentified aide had claimed Mr Cuomo reached under her shirt and fondled her after summoning her to his official residence. Mr Cuomo said he never touched anyone inappropriately. Beth Garvey, the governor\u2019s acting counsel, said in a statement on Thursday that as a matter of state policy, the woman who made the allegations was told she should contact her local police department. \u201cIn this case the person is represented by counsel and when counsel confirmed the client did not want to make a report, the state notified the police department and gave them the attorney\u2019s information,\u201d Ms Garvey said. She said the state was obligated to do so under state law. Earlier on Thursday, a group of 59 Democratic state legislators demanded Mr Cuomo\u2019s resignation in the wake of the allegation at the Executive Mansion last year. The letter released by the group comes as Mr Cuomo\u2019s grip on power in the state appeared increasingly tenuous. The top Democrat in the state Assembly, Speaker Carl Heastie, said he will meet with members in conference on \u201cpotential paths forward\u201d in light of mounting allegations. In New York, the Assembly is the legislative house that could move to impeach Mr Cuomo, who has faced multiple allegations that he made the workplace an uncomfortable place for young women with sexually suggestive remarks and behaviour, including unwanted touching and a kiss. Nineteen senators and 40 Assembly members said in a letter on Thursday that it was time for Mr Cuomo to go. Mr Cuomo has repeatedly said he will not resign and urged the public to await the outcome of an investigation of his conduct by state Attorney General Letitia James. Mr Cuomo has denied inappropriately touching anyone but has said he is sorry if he made anyone uncomfortable and did not intend to do so.",

        "full article": "By Geert De Clercq and Benoit Van Overstraeten PARIS, March 11 (Reuters) - The COVID-19 situation in greater Paris is \"especially worrying\" and the government will take extra restrictive measures there if the pandemic continues at its current pace, France's health minister said on Thursday. While new infections are not growing exponentially, the numbers taken into intensive care have reached a new 3-1/2-months high nationally, close to 4,000, as France faces more dangerous variants. \"At this moment we can say that the variants are more contagious and more dangerous and they now represent more than two thirds of infections in France\", Olivier Veran said. He said a new patient went into intensive care in the greater Paris region every 12 minutes, adding he did not know when the current peak of the epidemic would be reached there. France has imposed local weekend lockdowns, on top of a national 6 p.m. curfew, in northern and southern parts of the country. But the government has so far resisted such measures for greater Paris. In the Paris region, the number of people in ICU units is now close to 1,100 and could reach 1,500 by the end of March if the current trend continues, Veran said, adding that level would be \"critical\" for the area's hospital system. NO ASTRAZENECA SUSPENSION \"We will take all necessary measures if the spread of the pandemic maintains its current rhythm\", he said. France hopes its vaccination drive will enable it to avoid new restrictive measures. Reacting to some European countries suspending the AstraZeneca shot, Veran said France saw no reason to follow suit. After the health ministry briefing ended, an official announced that foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian would self-isolate after coming into contact with a family member who had tested positive. The number of new cases in France went up by 27,166 on Thursday, to 3.99 million, the world's sixth highest total, versus 30,303 on Wednesday and 25,279 a week ago. The seven-day moving average of daily new infections stands at 22,105, topping 22,000 for the first time since Nov. 22. There were 265 new deaths over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 89,830, the seventh-highest in the world, versus a seven-day moving average of 285. The health ministry also reported that 4.54 million people, or 8.7% of the adult population, had received a first vaccine and 2.16 million had also received a second shot, for a total of nearly 6.71 million injections. The government aims to vaccinate 10 million people by mid-April, 20 million by mid-May and 30 million by the summer.

        "full article": "By Julie Gordon and David Ljunggren OTTAWA, March 11 (Reuters) - If Canadians start spending the massive nest egg they have amassed during the coronavirus pandemic it could \"meaningfully affect\" economic growth, a top Bank of Canada official said on Thursday, suggesting this might even speed up the pace of rate hikes. Canadians on average spent C$4,000 less in 2020 and this, coupled with higher household incomes due to emergency aid transfers, adds up to C$180 billion ($143.6 billion) in excess pandemic savings, Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri said. \"There is much uncertainty about what Canadians will do with these savings. This is important because these savings are large enough to meaningfully affect the trajectory of the economy,\" he said in a speech to the restaurant industry. \"If Canadians spend more than we expect, it would strengthen the recovery in consumption and employment.\" The bank has created a scenario where Canadians spend 15% of those savings, or C$25 billion, from the second quarter of this year through the end of 2023. If they did, nominal household spending growth in 2021 would jump to 5% from the 4.3% the bank projected in January. The central bank has said it will not raise interest rates from record lows until economic slack is absorbed, which in its January forecast does not happen until some time in 2023. The bank will be updating those forecasts in April, he said. \"C$25 billion over three years is not a lot of additional spending, but it does have the impact of bringing the recovery sooner,\" Schembri later told reporters. \"So essentially, conditional on the outlook for potential output growth, if that were unchanged, the output gap would close sooner than we had in January,\" he continued. There are, however, downside risks to the scenario, he said, including the potential for a third wave of infections, a delay to the vaccine rollout, or if vaccines prove less effective against variants. Schembri also said the bank continued to see signs of \"excessive exuberance\" in housing markets and noted price increases were continuing to gain momentum. The bank, he said, was watching for \"a significant pick up in speculative activity.\" The Canadian dollar was trading 0.8% higher at 1.2522 to the greenback, or 79.86 U.S. cents, its biggest gain in seven weeks.

Manager Terry Francona said the club told Hamilton on Thursday that he wasn't part of their plans. The Indians will try to trade the 30-year-old, who signed a minor league contract last month and has been at big league training camp. \"We just felt, out of respect to Billy, because of being the veteran he is and being the really good veteran that he is, we didn\u00b4t think it was right to ask him to get on a bus and back up guys if we knew he wasn\u00b4t gonna be on the team.\" Francona said during a Zoom call from Arizona. \"He was a pro\u00b4s pro. He\u00b4s such a good kid and we\u00b4ll certainly attempt to help him land somewhere. That\u00b4s why we did it this quickly.\" Hamilton had his best seasons with Cincinnati from 2013-18. He stole at least 56 bases four straight seasons. He spent last season with the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs. Hamilton had been competing for one of Cleveland's two open starting outfield spots.

        "full article": "SALEM, Ore. (AP) - People in Oregon will be better prepared for earthquakes - particularly important in the Pacific Northwest because experts say \"the big one\" is coming - as an early warning system launched Thursday, the 10th anniversary of a devastating quake and tsunami in Japan. California already has the system, while Washington state will join in May to complete coverage of the West Coast. The ShakeAlert system operated by the U.S. Geological Survey uses seismographic sensors to detect significant earthquakes quickly so alerts reach smartphones and people can seek cover before the shaking starts. \"It\u00b4s very important that (the three states) are all partners in ShakeAlert, because earthquakes don\u00b4t respect geographic boundaries, and we have huge population centers all across the West Coast where earthquake risk is the highest in the contiguous U.S.,\" said Gabriel Lotto, ShakeAlert user engagement facilitator for the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. Earthquakes in the Cascadia subduction zone, which extends from the ocean off Northern California to Canada\u00b4s Vancouver Island, have an average magnitude of around 9, making them among the world\u00b4s biggest. A quake in that zone has a 37% probability of happening off Oregon in the next 50 years, with a slightly lower chance of one striking near Washington state, according to Chris Goldfinger, an Oregon State University professor and earthquake geologist. \"When a Cascadia event happens, the critical seconds of notice ShakeAlert warnings provide will save lives and reduce damage to important lifeline systems,\" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said.          FILE - In this Jan. 3, 2019, file photo, a mobile phone customer looks at an earthquake warning application on an iPhone in Los Angeles. An earthquake early warning system operated by the U.S. Geological Survey has been activated in Oregon on the 10th anniversary of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan. California already has the system. Washington state joins it in May, which will complete coverage of the West Coast of the contiguous United States. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)  The system cannot predict an earthquake but can give people a jump on seeking cover from falling objects and time to brace themselves. When an earthquake is detected, people who have alerts activated on their smartphones will get a message saying, \"Earthquake detected! Drop, cover, hold on. Protect yourself.\" Mobile apps also carry the alerts. Jenny Crayne of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry told reporters Wednesday that the system works by detecting an initial wave sent out by an earthquake. \"The P wave is first and fast. It travels out and ahead of the S wave, and it is not producing the shaking,\" Crayne said. \"The S wave is slower and second, and it\u00b4s the one that produces the real shaking and damage that you experience during an earthquake.\" The system's sensors can rapidly detect that initial P wave and send that data to a processing center, where algorithms can determine and estimate the geographical extent of the earthquake, the magnitude and the expected shaking intensity in different areas, Crayne said. If an area is expected to experience significant shaking, people there will receive an alert. But those at or very close to the epicenter of the quake won't receive the warning in time because the waves will be too close together. ShakeAlert can also slow trains to reduce derailments, open firehouse doors so they don't jam shut and protect water systems with automatic shutoffs. Installing early-warning shutoffs to things like electrical utilities and wastewater systems also are being considered, said Robert de Groot of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, California. In action in California, an alert was sent to some 2.5 million people as a magnitude 4.5 earthquake struck the Los Angeles suburb of El Monte last September, de Groot said. The goal is for 1,675 seismic stations to be built in the three West Coast states, de Groot said. The rollout in Oregon coincides with the 10th anniversary of Japan's magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people and caused meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. \"As we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the devastating Tohoku earthquake, we are committed to improving earthquake safety in the Pacific Northwest through our strong university and state partnerships,\" USGS Associate Director David Applegate said. ___ Follow Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky.",

The unarmed, unidentified intruder sneaked onto a C-40 Clipper plane - a military version of the Boeing 737 (like the one above) that is typically used to carry senior government leadersHe left the terminal and then headed to a flight line, it says.Here, a second failure was said to have occurred as the man found a gate leading to the flight line was partly open due to a malfunction which meant it couldn't fully close.\u00a0The intruder then made his way toward the aircraft which had its main entry door open and stairs in place because two aircrew members were carrying out a training exercise on board, the report says.\u00a0\u00a0He reportedly boarded the aircraft -\u00a0a military version of the Boeing 737 typically used to carry senior government leaders -\u00a0and walked to the back of the plane before exiting a few minutes later.In what was named as the third security failure, with the Air Force reporting that staff posted on the flight line 'failed to observe the man walking toward the aircraft' and then the crew members who saw him on board the aircraft 'did not challenge his presence' or report the breach to anyone else.\u00a0It was only when the man exited the plane and 'someone in the passenger terminal' reported their suspicions about him that he was stopped and arrested by security guards.\u00a0         The review says the presidential aircraft were not at risk at any point during the incident.

French media groups Vivendi and TF1, Xavier Niel, founder of telecom operator Iliad and Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky all reported their interest for M6, the newspaper said.

        "full article": "Jennifer Garner didn\u00b4t come up with the concept of a Yes Day. But when she and her middle daughter discovered Amy Krouse Rosenthal\u00b4s book about a crazy 24 hours where parents have to say yes to their children\u00b4s demands almost a decade ago, they were hooked. It became a beloved and exhausting annual tradition in the household. Then a few years ago a producer friend saw one of her Yes Day \"morning after\" photos on Instagram and had a revelation: This should be a movie. \" Yes Day,\" which debuts on Netflix Friday, stars Garner and Edgar Ramirez as the parents to three spirited kids, a young teenager played by Jenna Ortega and two littler ones, played by Julian Lerner and Everly Carganilla. It\u00b4s the first film Garner has produced in 10 years. \"I just went into kind of a kid mode for a really long time,\" Garner said. \"This the first thing I\u00b4ve ever developed from scratch. Because of that, the stories in it are really personal.\" During the virtual premiere, she said, her kids kept laughing at how many things had been inspired by their own Yes Days. For Yes Day curious parents, Garner said the asks are never too crazy, mostly ice cream for breakfast and sleeping outside and whatnot. Just be forewarned, the next day you might look a little \"haggard,\" according to Garner.          Director Miguel Arteta, standing center, appears on the set of his film \"Yes Day\" with actors Jennifer Garner, seated left, and Edgar Ramirez. (John P. Johnson/Netflix via AP)  \"You feel like you were out partying, but really you\u00b4re just hungover from being so tired,\" Garner said. For \"Yes Day,\" Garner went to Miguel Arteta to direct. She\u00b4d worked with him before on \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.\" \"I love Jen so much. She brings out the most optimistic and best part of me,\" Arteta said. \"And how can you say no to a movie called `Yes Day\u00b4?\" Arteta was the one who actually suggested that her character\u00b4s husband be of Latino descent and that their kids be biracial to more reflect a modern family. She loved the idea. He suggested Ramirez, who had never done a comedy before, but Arteta had seen sparks of comedic genius in his performance in \"Joy\" and thought it was worth a shot. Ramirez had never even met Garner before, but they both immediately clicked and thought, \"Where have you been all my life?\" He also brought a lot of positive energy to the sometimes chaotic (in a good way) set and was just delighted to be doing something different. \"I love comedy as a vehicle to talk about greater subjects that are happening in society,\" Ramirez said. \"I am so grateful to Jen and Miguel because this is a reflection of the world we live in. In a great multi-cultural city like Los Angeles and a state like California, these are the families that you see around every day. It\u00b4s important to see that on screen.\" \"Yes Day\" is full of very physical hijinks, from an epic water balloon fight (which took five days to film and over 30,000 balloons) to an ice cream eating contest (during which over 40 gallons were consumed), that sometimes required stunt doubles. Garner even brought on stunt coordinator Shauna Duggins, who she\u00b4s been working with since the first season of \"Alias,\" to assist. But it\u00b4s also about the parents. \"It\u00b4s difficult to find something that\u00b4s really fun and engaging for everyone from, you know, my 15-year-old down to a little kid. And you want it to be fun to watch but you have to speak to the parents as well,\" Garner said. \"That is what I\u00b4m so proud of about this movie.\" They\u00b4ve already heard from moms around the world just how grateful they are that the film speaks to marital dynamics. \"In a way, it\u00b4s also a love story,\" Ramirez said. His character in particular has to learn how to step up and help. Arteta and Garner are currently figuring out how to work together again. \"Jen Garner was the best partner as a producer. This movie comes straight from her heart,\" said Arteta, who revealed they\u00b4re already developing a sequel. \"I\u00b4m very excited because this family is really special. They do really love each other. They have that chemistry. I\u00b4m glad everybody\u00b4s up for getting back together.\" ___ Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr          Director Miguel Arteta, from left, appears on the set of his film \"Yes Day\" with actors Jenna Ortega and Jennifer Garner.

        "title": "Beekman's 3 helps No. 16 Virginia top Syracuse 72-69 in ACCs",
        "full article": "GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) - Reece Beekman hadn't made a shot all afternoon for 16th-ranked Virginia when the ball swung his way in the final seconds of a tie game. The freshman didn't hesitate. Beekman buried a 3-pointer as time expired to help the Cavaliers edge Syracuse 72-69 in Thursday's quarterfinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament, a shot that sent Beekman and his teammates sprinting around the court in celebration. Beekman was 0 for 5 from the field when Kihei Clark penetrated to the left elbow and then zipped the ball to Beekman waiting on the right wing. He launched a confident catch-and-shoot 3 with the horn sounding as the ball hit the high point of its arc before dropping cleanly through the net for the top-seeded Cavaliers (18-6), who advanced to face fourth-seeded Georgia Tech in Friday's semifinals. \"I was just thinking: It\u00b4s a big shot,\" Beekman said. \"My coaches, everybody believed in me, so they wouldn\u00b4t have me out there for no reason.\" Almost immediately, the 6-foot-3 guard started sprinting towards the other end of the court with his teammates pursuing him at full speed. They finally caught up with him and gathered at the far baseline near the Syracuse bench to celebrate.          Virginia guard Reece Beekman (2) and Virginia forward Sam Hauser (10) celebrate Beekman's game winning shot during the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Syracuse in the quarterfinal round of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament in Greensboro, N.C., Thursday, March 11, 2021. Virginia won the game 72-69. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome)  \"That's what March is,\" said teammate Sam Hauser, who confidently raised his arms signaling the 3 would be good as Beekman launched the winner. Yet that confidence belied the fact that Beekman had made only 8 of 31 3s (25.8%) all season entering Thursday. \"Beekman\u00b4s the one guy we want to shoot it there,\" Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. \"We don\u00b4t want to give anybody a shot, but he\u00b4s the one guy we want to shoot it. ... That\u00b4s the way it goes. He knocked it down.\" Buddy Boeheim finished with a career-high 31 points for the eighth-seeded Orange (16-9), a day after he scored 27 points in Syracuse's tournament opener. He nearly lifted the Orange to another win to help their NCAA Tournament chances. After Beekman's shot fell, the Orange coach's son stood near midcourt, hands on his knees in disbelief, while teammate Quincy Guerrier squatted down a few feet away. BIG PICTURE Syracuse: The Orange entered the week near the cut line in most NCAA projections, though a win against fellow bubble team North Carolina State on Wednesday helped that case. Afterward, Jim Boeheim said he thought the Orange \"did what we needed to do this year\" but with a wait-and-see caveat. Winning this one likely would have eliminated all doubt on that front. \"It's not up to me,\" Boeheim said, adding: \"There's no doubt in my mind, and I don't think anybody's mind that follows the sport and knows what they're doing.\" Virginia: The Cavaliers had won the regular-season race by beating Louisville after No. 15 Florida State lost at Notre Dame on the final day of the schedule. That gave the Cavaliers the No. 1 seed for the fifth time in eight seasons as they pursued a third tournament title under Tony Bennett. They had to rally from 11 down in the first half to advance. \"We survived,\" Bennett said. CAVS' OFFENSE Hauser scored 21 points to lead Virginia, while Trey Murphy III added 15 points. Murphy's day included back-to-back 3s from near the Virginia bench in the final 4 minutes - part of Virginia's 4-for-5 effort from behind the arc in the final 5 1/2 minutes. BUDDY'S ROLL Buddy Boeheim spent nearly two full games in Greensboro frustrating all defenders. The 6-foot-6 junior made 10 of 16 shots and six 3s in Wednesday's win against the Wolfpack, then came out hot by going for 15 points on 5-for-9 shooting in the first half against Virginia. Virginia did a better job on him for the first 15 minutes of the second half, only to see Boeheim get rolling again and score 11 of Syracuse's last 13 points. He finished 10 for 17 in this one with five 3s. \"I can't even describe Buddy's play,\" Jim Boeheim said, adding: \"I mean, you couldn't ask anything more out of a player than what he gave us today.\" UP NEXT Syracuse: The Orange await their NCAA Tournament fate on Selection Sunday.

Space is made to linger, everything is made sharp and tactile, but at a real clip. Her construction is so particular, but there are no seams.That is a miracle to me. I feel similarly about Nabokov, though you feel the exertion. You read him and you\u2019re out of breath. I love it.And Egan\u2019s Goon Squad is a dream for me, structurally. One day, when I hopefully have a better sense of discipline, I really hope to crack that form, the interconnected narrative.

I am here to talk about how I get bullied on the bus and at school because I don't wear a mask.'\u00a0She continued: 'First they called me an a-hole and said my parents don't care about me. Then they called me names like dumb and stupid. Also my school librarian doesn't let me sit around the room while others that do have a mask get to.\u00a0'Also, I have lost some friends over this pandemic and I don't like this at all.'Kuiken then shared a story about her, her mom and brother getting 'kicked out of my favorite store, Claire's, because we didn't wear masks'.

There's a big difference between walking into the middle of a highway and expecting not to get killed and going out without a mask for a virus with a 99 percent survival rate,' Alexis said, according to the Daily Beast.\u00a0After hearing the statements from the Kuikens and other members of the public, the council voted and it was a 4-4 tie.\u00a0'So that puts it onto me,' the mayor said. 'I obviously was hoping not to get in this position.'The mayor then went on to apologize to Council Member Rick Kylie, whom he'd promised to vote for an extension of the mask mandate and to health officials who he said 'have been our allies in this'.Still, while noting that he's not an expert on the pandemic, he voted to end the mask mandate, a move that could possibly jeopardize the lives of others.\u00a0'I am going to be voting against this tonight, and this item will end up failing 5-to-4,' he said. 'I would ask that you don't applaud because there's nothing happy about this. This is not good.''Based on what I feel is best for our community right now, I go against my word. And I'm doing that right now. You're watching it play out and it's very tough.'The mandate will now end on March 13.\u00a0\u00a0Sioux Falls has reported more than 114,000 cases in the city and 1,904 deaths.\u00a0The end to the city's mask mandate is nothing new and has already happened statewide in Texas, Mississippi,\u00a0Iowa, Montana and North Dakota.Putting an end to mask mandates has been slammed by President Joe Biden as 'Neanderthal thinking'.\u00a0Ending such guidance also goes against the recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

        "full article": "Referee Darren Drysdale has been handed a back-dated suspension following his confrontation with Ipswich midfielder Alan Judge. Drysdale was charged with improper conduct by the Football Association over the incident which happened during the Sky Bet League One match against Northampton at Portman Road on February 16. The 50-year-old Lincolnshire official squared up to Judge and then appeared to lean his head into the Republic of Ireland international after the midfielder\u2019s appeal for a penalty had been turned down. Drysdale subsequently apologised for his actions, with then Ipswich manager Paul Lambert having asked for the matter to be investigated. Drysdale has not refereed a match since the incident, after being removed from two EFL matches following the confrontation, but will now be available to officiate again. On Thursday, the FA confirmed an independent regulatory commission had given Drysdale a back-dated suspension and warning as to his future behaviour for a breach of FA Rule E3. A statement read: \u201cThe match official admitted that his behaviour during the 90th minute of an EFL League One tie between Ipswich Town FC and Northampton Town FC on Tuesday 16 February 2021 amounted to improper conduct. \u201cThe suspension, which ran from 19 February 2021 to 10 March 2021, and warning were imposed by the independent Regulatory Commission during a subsequent hearing.\u201d An independent Regulatory Commission has given Darren Drysdale a back-dated suspension and warning as to his future conduct for a breach of FA Rule E3.

Written reasons: https://t.co/qNJwJjzsGE. pic.twitter.com/15WbRMOSkX\u2014 FA Spokesperson (@FAspokesperson) March 11, 2021   Judge, meanwhile, stressed he was not looking for an apology or for any action to be taken, saying: \u201cReferees have a tough job to do and it was heat of the moment stuff that happens in football.\u201d The written reasons behind the decision were also published by the FA. In his statement, Drysdale offered an explanation of his behaviour after watching as Judge \u201cexaggerates his fall in a desperate attempt to gain a penalty kick for his team.\u201d The referee continued: \u201cI then processed what had happened for a few seconds before blowing my whistle and decided to caution Alan Judge for an act of trying to deceive a match official. \u201cAs I blew my whistle Alan Judge shouted aggressively in a loud voice at me and from a distance of only 5 metres \u2018It\u2019s a ******* penalty you cheating bald ****!\u2019 \ud83d\udcac \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for an apology and I wasn\u2019t looking for him to be charged.

In a statement on the Ipswich website, Republic of Ireland international Judge said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make anything of it because it\u2019s a tough job being a referee, but I\u2019m not going to keep quiet when I\u2019ve been accused of calling the referee a cheat and using the C word. \u201cI\u2019ll admit using the F word, but I said to him \u2018you have got to be F****** joking me and I said that a couple of times to him. I never used the C word. I don\u2019t use that word and I didn\u2019t call him a cheat. \u201cMy mum passed away last week \u2013 which is far more important than this \u2013 and I don\u2019t need this hassle to be honest. \u201cLike I said, the matter was closed, but I\u2019ve got a decent reputation in the game and I won\u2019t stand by and be accused of saying something I didn\u2019t and not responding.\u201d Judge added: \u201cOur media team have got some audio and it backs me up. Some people have said I should have come out straightaway and explained what I said but I didn\u2019t want to do that. \u201cI was trying to help Darren. I said the matter was finished and it was, but I have to make it clear now that I totally dispute what has been said by the referee.\u201d",

        "full article": "By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, March 11 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks climbed for a third straight session on Thursday to hit its highest level in two weeks, as a dip in government bond yields helped ease inflation worries and provided a boost to equities. Euro zone bond yields fell after the European Central Bank said it was ready to accelerate money-printing to keep a lid on euro zone borrowing costs, using its 1.85 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) more generously over the coming months to stop any unwarranted rise in debt financing costs. Germany's 10-year government bond yield was last unchanged at -0.333%, after falling as far as -0.367%, the lowest level since Feb. 18 and further away from the near one-year high of -0.203% in late February. The Yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 1.475%, the first time it had dipped below 1.5% in a week. It was last at 1.5213%. On Wall Street, the easing inflation worry helped support equities, with the highly valued technology sector leading the way higher, up 2.40%. Expensive stocks, many of which are in the tech sector, have been highly sensitive to the rise in yields. In contrast, shares of bank stocks lost 0.25%. \"The rates pulling in, as modest as the pull in has been, is a big stimulus for the market,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \"For now, things are good. Yeah, there is a question of leadership between growth and value but I don\u00b4t think either one is going to fall far behind the other in this environment and we see that with this back and forth.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 292.27 points, or 0.9%, to 32,589.29, the S&amp;P 500 gained 53.17 points, or 1.36%, to 3,951.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 339.40 points, or 2.6%, to 13,408.23. Sentiment was also boosted by weekly jobless claims data, which pointed to a recovering U.S. labor market as vaccine rollouts have helped lead to economic reopenings. European stocks climbed, with the pan-European STOXX 600 higher for a fourth straight day, its longest winning streak in five weeks, with the index closing at its highest level since Feb. 21, 2020. The STOXX 600 index rose 0.49% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.52%. An auction of 30-year U.S. debt on Thursday was viewed as slightly weak, but nowhere near the disappointing seven-year auction in late February that helped fuel inflation concerns and sent yields higher. Analysts largely expect inflation to pick up as vaccine rollouts lead to a reopening of the economy, but worries persist that additional stimulus in the form of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package set to be signed by U.S. President Joe Biden could overheat the economy. The dollar was weaker for a third straight day coming off a 3-1/2 month high of 92.506. The dollar index fell 0.415%, with the euro up 0.49% to $1.1984. Oil prices resumed their climb following two days of declines, buoyed by the brightening economic outlook and a decline in the dollar. U.S. crude rose 2.25% to $65.89 per barrel and Brent was at $69.52, up 2.39% on the day.

Sangay has had several moderate eruptions over the past two years, often with little impact due to its remote location in the jungle of Morona Santiago province. But activity over the past few weeks has sent ash falling over several Andean towns, damaging crops and cattle. On Thursday, an ash plume had risen to 8,480 meters above the volcano's crater and was moving toward the west, the National Risk Management Service said. It could reach towns in coastal Guayas province later on Thursday, the service added. Authorities canceled events in Chimborazo province and recommended residents stay in their homes.

        "full article": "By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON, March 11 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone in 2016 unplugged a Texas power plant that it owned from the state's grid in a bet that it could make a fortune as the only American-based generator selling electricity exclusively to Mexico. That bet has gone south. Nearly five years later, Blackstone's gas-fired plant, Frontera Holdings LLC, is struggling to exit bankruptcy after burning investors holding nearly $1 billion of its debt - the victim of a succession of problems ranging from a power market collapse in Mexico in 2020 to last month's severe cold snap. Frontera filed for bankruptcy protection last month in Houston, extinguishing loans and notes held by U.S. hedge funds, mutual funds, pensions and private equity firms, according to U.S. regulatory filings. While the company has since secured $145 million in financing for a fresh start, its future is uncertain: Mexico has announced market reforms that could undo Frontera's business model, and the facility is at risk of big fines for failing to deliver power during the regional deep freeze. Early last month, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would crack down on his country's wholesale electricity market, saying power producers are among those that have made excessive profits. He is also now armed with a new law that would open the door to renegotiating and potentially terminating contracts with independent producers such as Frontera. About two weeks later, the deep freeze hit Texas and northern Mexico, knocking Frontera and other power generators offline. Lawyers for Frontera say the plant may face penalties for not being able to supply power for several days. Blackstone Group LP declined to comment on the impact of the developments on Frontera's plans to exit bankruptcy. Frontera attorney Matthew Fagen of Kirkland &amp; Ellis told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur late last month, after the cold snap, that the company's planned exit from bankruptcy in the spring remains on track. Frontera's bet was going well before things fell apart. The plant, for example, generated about $87 million in profit on nearly $200 million of revenue in 2019, according to disclosures in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. That year, Blackstone paid itself a dividend of about $116 million, following a similar payout of $120 million the previous year, from operating cash and incremental debt, court disclosures show. Frontera owns 100% of its transmission line to Mexico and has exclusive use of it. New U.S.-based entrants likely would not have that advantage because of rule changes at the U.S. Department of Energy. But last year peak pricing for electricity in the Mexican market tumbled 70%, in part because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on the economy. Frontera posted a $9 million operating loss on $79 million in revenue that year, court disclosures show. (Reporting By Tim McLaughlin; editing by David Evans)",

        "full article": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza rallied from a set and a break down Thursday to beat Aryna Sabalenka for the second week in a row and reach the semifinals of the Dubai Championships. Muguruza was broken in the opening game of the second set before turning the match around to win 3-6, 6-3, 6-2. She has reached back-to-back semifinals, having lost to Petra Kvitova in the Qatar Open final last week. Muguruza faces Elise Mertens in the semifinals after the 10th-seeded Belgian saved three match points to beat Jessica Pegula 5-7, 7-5, 6-0. Pegula served for the match at 5-3 in the second set and had the match points on Mertens' serve in the next game. Mertens won the last 11 games. Muguruza won her only previous meeting with Mertens at the 2016 U.S. Open. Jil Teichmann won 6-3, 6-3 against 16-year-old American Coco Gauff to set up a semifinal with doubles specialist Barbora Krejcikova. Krejcikova is a match away from her second career singles final after beating Anastasia Potapova 6-0, 6-2. The Czech player is a five-time Grand Slam champion in doubles, including winning her third consecutive mixed doubles title at the Australian Open last month. Her only tour singles final was a one-sided loss to Kiki Bertens in Nuremberg in 2017. ___ More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

He followed his father, a devoted angler, along the banks of Berkshire chalk streams.\u00a0         Scientist Richard Fortey (pictured) has penned a memoir about his childhood, exploring how his obsession with the natural world began when he was a young boyHe collected birds' eggs \u2014 this was legal, just, in the early 1950s, but he still feels slightly guilty about it.At school, he avoided sports. During games of cricket he preferred to be 'far out on the pitch where the ball rarely came, and where I could identify wildflowers and take an interest in passing insects'.He cherished a field guide to flowers in which he could tick off those he had seen. He took pleasure in the charm of their names \u2014 wood goldilocks, Venus's looking-glass, ploughman's spikenard \u2014 which are 'often only a short step away from poetry'.

        "full article": "BERLIN, March 11 (Reuters) - Germany agreed on Thursday to cooperate with Saudi Arabia on the generation, processing and transport of hydrogen, seen as a green fuel when renewable energy sources are used in its production. Germany has started a large-scale effort to develop environmentally-friendly hydrogen to protect key industries while it decarbonises its economy to meet climate protection goals. However, as future German demand for the element cannot be met domestically, it is seeking partnerships overseas to secure imports. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the declaration of intent signed with Saudi Arabia laid the groundwork for close cooperation with an important international partner. \"To achieve Paris Climate Agreement goals and to successfully shape our switch to renewable energy, Germany is dependent on the import of climate-neutral hydrogen,\" he said in a statement. The two countries aim to work on concrete hydrogen projects together, such as at one in the Saudi NEOM business region, said the ministry. Green hydrogen is produced from water by electrolysis using renewable power. (Reporting by Madeline Chambers Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

Aaron Wiggins supplied 19 points, six rebounds and three steals for the eighth-seeded Terrapins (16-12), who will face top-seeded Michigan in the quarterfinals on Friday. Jairus Hamilton added nine points as Maryland enhanced its chance of an NCAA Tournament bid. Malik Hall's 19 points led the ninth-seeded Spartans (15-12). Aaron Henry contributed 12 points, nine rebounds, three assists and three steals but he also committed six turnovers. Michigan State had 18 turnovers, which the Terrapins converted into 27 points. The Spartans scored just two points off Maryland's 11 turnovers. The Terrapins shot 38.2 percent from the field but made 20 of 28 free throws, while Michigan State made just half of its 18 free throw attempts. The Spartans went scoreless for more than six minutes at the start of the second half as Maryland stretched its four-point halftime lead to 12. Wiggins converted a pair of layups and Ayala completed the run with a putback to make it 42-30. A.J. Hoggard finally ended Michigan State's drought with a basket in the lane with 13:43 to play. Up 10 midway through the half, the Terrapins scored the next eight points to make it 55-37. Wiggins got the spurt started with a layup. He then made a steal, leading to a Hamilton three-point play. Wiggins completed the run with another three-point play. A pair of Ayala free throws with 7:13 remaining gave Maryland its biggest lead at 59-40. Maryland rallied from a double-digit deficit to take a 34-30 halftime lead. Free throws were a major factor, as the Terrapins outscored the Spartans 15-5 at the foul line in the first half. The Spartans were up 23-11 midway through the half. The Terrapins then went on an 18-4 run, capped by a Wiggins dunk. Michigan State coach Tom Izzo was assessed a technical during that span as he argued about foul calls.

        "full article": "March 11 (Reuters) - Black-owned wineries in the United States are seeking to raise awareness of their brands and encourage more young people of color to enter the industry. The Association of African American Vintners says it has grown by 500% since 2019. But there is still much to do, said Phil Long, the organization's president and founder of Longevity Wines in Livermore, California. \"There are thousands and thousands of wineries in this country... and out of those wineries, what are there, a couple of dozen that are Black-owned,\" said Long. \"Once I realized how few there were and I started understanding the non-diverse landscape, that's when it became more of an element of who I am,\" he said. Long, and his late wife, Debra, created Longevity, vowing to be inclusive after an unsettling experience at a winery in Santa Barbara. Recounting how he waited to sample the wine, Long said, \"I stood there waiting ... and no one ever acknowledged me.\" Sunshine Foss, who opened Happy Cork Wine and Spirits in 2018 in Brooklyn, New York, at first found it challenging to stock shelves with Black-owned brands, but says now people are approaching her. \"A lot of the winemakers that I talk to... tell me, they would walk into wine stores, say, hey, I have this amazing product and people wouldn't even look at them,\" Foss said. \"So, for me, it's extremely important to be able to give this platform to a lot of these Black-owned wine makers.\" The store carries labels from around the world, including offerings by American singers Mary J. Blige and John Legend, and NBA star Dwyane Wade. Kristin Braswell's company CrushGlobal Travel launched virtual wine tastings during the pandemic lockdown after seeing the need to speak to a Black audience. \"Just as the Black traveler is not a monolith, neither is the Black wine drinker and so I felt like this was a great opportunity... to show the wine industry we are interested in drinking wine, traveling, learning and purchasing.\" In February, several of the world's premiere Black-owned wine brands participated in the virtual International Winemakers Summit, and shared their experiences of racism and hope within the wine community. \"We're out there doing what we can to show... that our place is very much valid like anybody else's in this industry,\" said Nyarai Cellars owner Steve Byfield.

        "full article": "By Maximilian Heath BUENOS AIRES, March 11 (Reuters) - Argentina is expected to harvest 44 million tonnes of soy and 45 million tonnes of corn this season, below the previously forecast 46 million tonnes for each crop, due to dry conditions, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said on Thursday. The country's Pampas farm belt has suffered unusually dry weather since the middle of 2020. A recent heatwave combined with low rainfall has exacerbated the situation. \"Early-planted soy fields are approaching harvest with expected yields below historical averages. Late-planted soy is seeing losses of harvestable area due to pest attacks and depleted water reserves,\" the exchange said in its weekly crop report. \"At the same time, the worsening condition of corn crops has generated a decrease in yield expectations,\" the exchange said. The central Pampas will continue to have high temperatures and only spotty rainfall over the days ahead, the exchange said in a separate weather report earlier in the day. Although early-year showers brought partial relief to some of the driest areas, uneven rainfall in February and March forced the Rosario exchange to sharply cut its 2020/2021 soybean harvest estimate to 45 million tonnes on Wednesday. \"The climatic situation is very dramatic and very negative for late-planted soybeans. Many soybean crops have already been lost because the rains did not come,\" said Pablo Adreani, a Buenos Aires-based agricultural consultant. \"With regard to late-planted corn, the situation is a little better because corn has later flowering and vegetative periods, so it has more time to receive water than soy,\" Adreani said. Argentina is the world's largest exporter of processed soybean oil and meal, and the third-largest corn exporter. Harvesting of 2020/2021 soybeans and corn, the two main crops in the country, is set to begin in the coming weeks. \"Tropical winds will return, causing very high maximum temperatures in the center of the agricultural area,\" the exchange said in its earlier weather report. \"Towards the end of the forecast (by next Thursday), the passage of a storm front will begin, producing general rainfall of varying intensity over the western part of the agricultural area, but without reaching its easterly zone\", it said, referring to the area most affected by the drought.

RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       WHAT BOOK would author Lionel Shriver take to a desert...    LITERARY FICTION\u00a0\u00a0      Share this article Share   There are few trendy topics that Double Blind doesn't touch on \u2014 from epigenetics to the Anthropocene, neuroscience to wearable virtual reality \u2014 as it glides between England, Cap d'Antibes and California's Big Sur.\u00a0Fortunately, this is the best kind of novel of ideas, as entertaining as it is chewy, not to mention immensely pleasurable on the sentence level.         HOT STEW by Fiona Mozley (John Murray \u00a316.99, 320 pp)HOT STEWby Fiona Mozley (John Murray \u00a316.99, 320 pp)Fiona Mozley had yet to turn 30 when Elmet, her debut, made the 2017 Booker shortlist. There's no evidence of difficult second-novel syndrome here though.The title refers to London's 'stews' (as brothels were known in Tudor times), a present-day version of which is both workplace and home to Precious and her companion, Tabitha.But now owner Agatha, the billionaire heiress daughter of a murderous gangland boss, is intent on making over her buildings and maximising her rents, a process known as 'blank slating'.\u00a0However, the past of the capital \u2014 like that of many of Mozley's large and diverse cast of characters \u2014 persists.At one level this rangily plotted romp is a pure nostalgia trip: a portrait of pre-pandemic Soho with all its unlikely cheek-by-jowl conjunctions and heady mixture of pleasure and sleaze.But it's also an exploration of exploitation and desire, privilege and prejudice that at times recalls the Oscar-winning Korean film, Parasite.         KITCHENLY 434 by Alan Warner (White Rabbit \u00a318.99, 368 pp)KITCHENLY 434by Alan Warner (White Rabbit \u00a318.99, 368 pp)This rock'n'roll Remains Of The Day is a hoot. Set over the course of a summer in the late 1970s, it's narrated by Crofton Park, factotum for, and loyal fan of, prog-rock star Marko Morrell.Kitchenly is Marko's moated Sussex pile, but so rarely is the owner at home that he requires help just locating the light switches. (The concept of 'bin day' is completely beyond the rocker's ken.)But Crofton is nothing if not devoted, appreciative even of Kitchenly's Tudorbethan stones, which \u2014 like the lush surrounding countryside \u2014 move him to lyrical flights.However, the idyll begins to unravel when Crofton's chivalrous stewardship of two young fans lands him in hot water, and he is finally forced to acknowledge that times are changing.Warner inspires such tender fondness for poor Crofton's hilarious (and frequently wince-making) folly that at times it's painful to read on.\u00a0Part farce, part elegy, part tragi-comically belated coming-of-age story, this is a pleasure from beginning to end.\u00a0To buy any book reviewed here, visit mailshop.co.uk/books or call 020 3308 9193",

        "full article": "Ender Inciarte's attempt to win a starting job in the Atlanta Braves' outfield is temporarily on hold as he recovers from a thumb injury. Rookie Cristian Pache, the Braves' choice over Inciarte to fill in during the postseason last year, is competing for the starting job in center field. Braves manager Brian Snitker said Thursday that Inciarte hurt his thumb when he got hit by the fists with an inside pitch during a recent at-bat. \"It\u00b4s just been a slow process getting him treated and getting a bat in his hand again,\" Snitker said. Snitker said he does not know when Inciarte will be able to play. \"He\u00b4s progressing, but he\u00b4s just not to the point where he could go out and get a game at-bat right now,\" Snitker said. \"We\u00b4ll just have to wait and see.\"          Atlanta Braves Ender Inciarte, right, gets five from first base coach Eric Young, left, after hitting a single against the Minnesota Twins during the third inning of an MLB spring training game Tuesday, March 2, 2021, in North Port, Fla. (Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)  This is a crucial season for Inciarte, 30, as he tries to reverse an offensive decline. He is entering the final season of a $30.5 million, five-year contract that includes a team option for 2022. Inciarte hit .190 in 46 games last season after hitting .246 in 2019. He was an All-Star in 2017, when he hit .304 and hit a career-high 11 homers with 22 stolen bases while winning his second of three consecutive Gold Gloves. Inciate's offensive funk created an opening for Pache, who was the choice to start after the Braves lost Adam Duvall to an oblique injury in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Following Duvall\u00b4s injury, Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. moved to right field. This year's starting outfield is expected to include Marcell Ozuna in left field, Acu\u00f1a in right field and either Pache or Inciarte in center field. Duvall signed with Miami. Pache, regarded as the organization's top defensive player in the outfield, earned the postseason opportunity despite having only four regular-season at-bats. He has only strengthened his status as a top prospect this spring. \"I\u00b4ve liked what Pache has done,\" Snitker said. \"He\u00b4s had some really good at-bats. We\u00b4re going to keep running him out there. I feel good with where he\u00b4s at.\" Pache hit eighth in Thursday's game against Tampa Bay. ___ More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB          Atlanta Braves manager Brian Snitker watches from the dugout as his team plays the Boston Red Sox in a spring training baseball game Wednesday, March 10, 2021, in Fort Myers, Fla.

        "full article": "MEMOIRThe Wild Trackby Margaret Reynolds with Lucy Reynolds (Doubleday \u00a316.00, 320pp)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mothers frazzled, exasperated and (let\u2019s be honest) often bored at the demands of looking after small children might have surveyed Professor Margaret Reynolds\u2019s life with envy.She was \u2014 and still is \u2014 a leading academic, a writer and editor, a broadcaster, an expert on opera, a lover of travel and a well-known figure in literary circles.Yet Reynolds added extraordinary layers of complication to that sophisticated lifestyle when she chose to adopt a child.Single, in her mid-40s and having experienced early menopause, Reynolds (Peggy to her friends) quietly realised that her heart yearned for one thing: motherhood.         Author Margaret Reynold (pictured with daughter Lucy) began her adoption journey when she was in her mid-40s, single and having experienced the early menopauseThe majority of women become mothers quite casually, but for those who want to adopt, it is a long quest fraught with questions, doubts, bureaucracy, confusion, disappointment.Most of us are aware of how hard it is to adopt a child \u2014the process took Reynolds seven years of struggle \u2014 but nobody would deny that utmost care must be taken.\u00a0Having said that, her account of all the hoops she had to jump through, the panels she had to face, the mistakes she made, is enthralling and frustrating in equal measure.Despite volunteering in a nursery and a school, and showing that she is willing and able to rearrange her life to accommodate a child, Reynolds (like many would-be adopters) meets initial rejections.\u00a0Early on she makes a colossal mistake in failing to disclose that, as well as being divorced, she has had a long relationship with a woman.         The adoption process took Reynolds seven years after being initially rejected, until she adopted a six-year-old girl, whose intelligence was noted by social workers but whose early years were chaoticHer view was that it was irrelevant to her current situation, but to the social workers this was a breach of trust. Reynolds knew she had to \u2018work hard to be given a second chance\u2019 \u2014 and that the need for adopters was certainly there.\u00a0In 2017 in England and Wales, 90 children a day were taken into care. In that year 70,000 were being fostered. Reynolds calls the care system a \u2018ghastly cycle\u2019 \u2014 one that leaves the children with \u2018no chance of developing the secure attachment that is so crucial in early years\u2019.Once you consider too the difficulties of inter-country adoption, which Reynolds also experienced, your head starts to reel with the knowledge that \u2018there are millions of children living in institutions across the world and also on the streets\u2019.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Faithful friend who chased away my breakdown:...    The endless search for treasures in the attic. As TV...      Share this article Share   For Reynolds, Russia was out because they have an upper age limit and she was too old; many other countries only accept married couples. But she refused to give up, hoping, she said, that \u2018the joy I see in the faces of my friends who are adoptive parents will be mine\u2019. At last it becomes clear that Reynolds must apply for a domestic adoption of an older child.\u00a0A little girl is finally found \u2014 a child of six whose intelligence has been noted by social workers, but whose early years were (of course) chaotic. She has to be taken from foster carers and cries all the way to the quaint little home Reynolds has made ready in the countryside.         When Reynolds took Lucy from foster carers and drove her home, Lucy cried all the way and settled a couple of days later after the neighbour's dog provided accidental therapy. In the final two chapters of the book, Lucy, now an older teenager, is given her own voiceThe first day is \u2018ghastly\u2019 as the little stranger won\u2019t settle and refuses food. A couple of days later a neighbour\u2019s dog provides accidental therapy, then little Lucy picks out a toy dog from the basket of donated toys and child and toy become inseparable.         The Wild Track by Margaret Reynolds with Lucy Reynolds (Doubleday \u00a316.00, 320pp)Reynolds is exhausted by the \u2018many gulfs and gaps to negotiate\u2019, but new mother and anxious child read Anne Of Green Gables again and again, and slowly get to know each other.That child, now an older teenager, is given her own voice in the final two chapters of this beautifully written and intensely moving book. Lucy\u2019s story, sparely told, is painful (\u2018I had been traumatised, neglected and moved more times than my age at the time of adoption\u2019), unsentimental and mature.The frightened child has become a self-possessed young woman. Both mother and daughter recount a magical snowy day of sledging, and Lucy notes that \u2018one powerfully joyous memory can outweigh hundreds of negative memories, even if those negative memories will never be truly erased\u2019.Lucy\u2019s name is on the title page \u2014 and deserves to be there. For this is the story of two women made more extraordinary by each other, who shared \u2018the resilience to carry on\u2019, and have been rewarded by a relationship almost too rich to be called \u2018love\u2019.",

Rose was later charged with a tenth - the killing of her stepdaughter Charmaine West, eight, in 1971.\u00a0It was found the couple tortured to a sadistic degree and killed young women and girls in the basement of their Gloucester home.\u00a0While Fred committed suicide before his trial in January 1995, Rose was found guilty on all counts and is currently serving a life prison sentence at HM Prison New Hall in Yorkshire.The documentary delves into the theory West was born evil, or a product of her horrific upbringing, which saw her father sexually abuse her from a young age.\u00a0Goatley, who represented West from 1992 to 2004, says in the programme that she struggled to face reality, and had given him a 'candy-coated' version of her childhood, denying the abuse had ever happened.\u00a0\u00a0                The former solicitor of British serial killer Rose West, Leo Goatley, said in an interview for the upcoming Channel 5 documentary, Rose: Making a Monster, that West, right, was in denial about her childhood, and said she had protective parents, in spite of the fact her father, Bill Letts, pictured centre, sexually abused her from a young age         As a child, pictured, West was repeatedly abused by her violent father.

Her father, Bill Letts, was a service man but had to quit his military career to look after the kids at home, because his wife Daisy suffered from pre-natal depression while she carried Rose.Daisy had ECT courses late in pregnancy, with her last session taking place the day before giving birth, and it's believed the shock therapy had an impact on Rose's brain development.\u00a0\u00a0Letts had a sadistic streak and pedophile tendencies, and started sexually abusing Rose from a young age.Dr Jane Carter Woodrow, criminologist and author of Rose West: The making of a Monster, explained Rose was quiet, and so Letts knew she wouldn't speak out about the abuse. She added that Letts started grooming Rose from a very young age.\u00a0         Rose aged six, top centre, as a child with her siblings.

Fred killed himself in 1995 after confessing to the killings. Rose is still alive and serving a life sentence in prison\u00a0Dr David Holmes, a criminal psychologist, said the abuse Rose suffered 'limited her development', adding:\u00a0'She was learning the wrong skills and wrong motivations for life.\u00a0'She was on a path that would also certainly lead to abusive relations in the future and be a instigator of abusive relations as well.'\u00a0Geoffrey Wansell, the official biographer of Fred West, said in the documentary: 'There's not doubt Bill Lets altered his daughter considerably', adding:\u00a0Letts was, there's no other words for it, a monster.'Wansell told how Letts terrorised his wife and children, having hid his paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis from Daisy.\u00a0         Rose and Fred West as a young couple shortly after they started dating, with Rose being only 16 and Fred 29         Fred working as a builder in the 1980s. Criminal psychologist Dr David Holmes said in the documentary that Rose and Fred entertained each other's fetishes, which included voyeurism and exhibitionism as well as more 'macabre' fantasies and sadistic tendencies\u00a0'It's impossible to convey just how dysfunctional the Letts family was,' Wansell said.\u00a0'Letts was fierce and intimidating.'Because she struggled academically, Rose was held back a year and enjoyed being the oldest child in her class, which gave her a sense of strength and power.'As a child,\u00a0Rose began to identify with Bill and thinking of herself as someone who is strong and can create fear in others. This resulted in her going out and bullying other children,' Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0As she grew older, Rose garnered a reputation as a 'nymphomaniac' around town, and was known to have sex with older men.\u00a0Dr Holmes said he believes the abuse she suffered at the hands of her own father 'normalised' this for her.\u00a0This led her to meet and date Fred West, then 29, when she was just 16. Fred, who Rose said 'could charm anyone,' saw in the teenager a conduit for his sexual fantasies, which at the time included bondage, Dr Carter Woodrow said.\u00a0\u00a0         Fred West being handcuffed and led out of court after his pre-trial, shortly before his death on New Year's Eve 1995         A chilling look at the Wests' basement, which they used as a torture chamber for their victims, which included their own children\u00a0         Police searching the gardens of 25 Cromwell Street in search of more evidence following the arrest of Fred and Rose West in 1994         A man carries the remains of a body found in the Wests' garden in Gloucester during the police investigationThe two soon moved into together, but not long after the birth of their daughter Heather, Fred was arrested for petty theft and jailed, leaving Rose with the newborn baby and his two daughters from other relations, Charmaine and Anne-Marie.\u00a0She started beating the children, especially Charmaine, who was rebellious and refused to give in to Rose's bullying.\u00a0This sadly led to Rose's first murder; she killed Charmaine in June 1971, soon before Fred's release from prison.\u00a0 Who are Rosemary and Frederick West?\u00a0 West, who has consistently claimed her innocence, and husband Fred, abducted, tortured and raped innocent women over a 20 year period at their house in Cromwell Street, Gloucestershire, where they resided from 1972 until their arrests in 1994.The pair even killed their eldest daughter Heather in June 1987.Fred, who confessed the killings, committed suicide in his cell while on remand at HMP Birmingham on New Year's Day, 1995.Other victims included Alison Chambers, 16, Shirley Robinson, 18, Juanita Mott, 18, Shirley Hubbard, 15, Theresa Siegnethaler, 21, Lucy Partington, 21, Carol Ann Cooper, 15, Lynda Gough, 19, Rena Costello (Fred's ex-wife), 27, Charmaine West (Fred's daughter), 8, and Anne McFall, 18.Fred is also believed to have also killed 15-year-old Mary Bastholm, although her remains have never been found.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Advertisement\n 'I think Rose, with the stress and luggage that she was carrying and the anger that she had within her, she was capable of killing Charmaine,' Goatley said, adding it didn't mean she would have necessarily planned the murder.\u00a0Fred buried Charmaine's body after his release from prison. This led to him murdering his ex-wife Rina West, who was Charmaine's mother, and had been asking about the eight-year-old.\u00a0After Fred's release from prison, the couple moved to 25 Cromwell Street, where Rose began working as a prostitute in one of the spare rooms, while Fred spied on her.\u00a0\u00a0Dr Holmes said: 'This gave them the chance, as it were, to partition their lives to be able to control element of Fred's voyeurism activity with her sex activity.'Soon after, the couple converted the basement of their house into a torture chamber, and they started cruising for young female victims.\u00a0This culminated with the murder of their own daughter Heather West, 16, in 1987, after they'd sexually abused her throughout her life.\u00a0Other victims included Alison Chambers, 16, Shirley Robinson, 18, Juanita Mott, 18, Shirley Hubbard, 15, Theresa Siegnethaler, 21, Lucy Partington, 21, Carol Ann Cooper, 15, Lynda Gough, 19, and Anne McFall, 18.\u00a0Following Heather's death, Fred was accused of sexually abusing his 13-year-old daughter Mae in 1992, which launched a child services investigation into the disappearance of Heather.The police found Heather's body and other human remains under the Wests' house, which led to their arrest and subsequent trial.\u00a0After Fred confessed to the killings, he killed himself on New Year's Eve 1995, and Rose faced trial alone from February until November 1995.\u00a0She was found guilty on all counts of murder and is currently serving her life sentence. She will die in prison.\u00a0Rose: Making a Monster airs on Wednesday 17 March on Channel 5 at 9pm.",

'He's the most annoying man I've ever met, but I find working with him exhilarating. Yes, he drives me nuts, but he also makes me laugh - and when the chips are down, and there's a big news story breaking or we're doing a controversial interview with a politician, I trust him.'         Reid, 50, said: 'He totally wound me up from the moment he joined Good Morning Britain. He's the most annoying man I've ever met, but I find working with him exhilarating. Yes, he drives me nuts, but he also makes me laugh - and when the chips are down, and there's a big news story breaking or we're doing a controversial interview with a politician, I trust him'The colleagues quickly became famed for their vicious on-air battles, with Piers' forthright views also often generating fierce debate and controversy among GMB's millions of viewers.For countless Britons, he was must-see TV, celebrated for his no-nonsense approach and for holding Ministers to account throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prior to his five-year stint on Good Morning Britain, Piers made his name in newspapers, becoming at 29 the youngest national newspaper editor in half a century when he rose the ranks of the News of the World in 1994.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The journalist left the paper following the controversial publication of photographs of\u00a0Catherine Victoria Aitken,\u00a0formerly Victoria Spencer, Countess Spencer, in 1995.He later joined rival tabloid the Daily Mirror, but was sacked 'with immediate effect' in May 2004 after the newspaper published false images which alleged to show Iraqi prisoners being abused by British soldiers.\u00a0The photographs were shown to be fakes within days, and the Mirror claimed it had fallen victim to a 'calculated and malicious hoax' when apologising for the publication.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Piers began a distinguished career in television before departing the Mirror, reinventing himself as a CNN presenter in the US where he has a significant following.\u00a0         Kate Garraway, Piers Morgan, Sarah Ferguson Duchess of York and Susanna Reid in November 2018\u00a0He replaced television and radio host Larry King\u00a0in the network's evening line-up with his show Piers Morgan Live, which began in January 2011 before ending its run in March 2014.It was around this time that the straight-talking host began presenting the hugely successful chat show\u00a0Piers Morgan's Life Stories, in which he quizzes high-profile celebrities including Sharon Osbourne and Trisha Goddard one-on-one.The show, which began in\u00a0February 2009 and is ongoing, has also featured appearances from Elton John, Rod Stewart and Captain Tom Moore - who raised millions for the NHS in a charity walk during the Covid-19 crisis.Outside the world of journalism, Piers has also appeared as a judge on America's Got Talent in 2006 and later on the British version of the show. He also won the US Celebrity Apprentice in 2007, which featured former US President Donald Trump.Moving on from his past success, and his departure from GMB, Piers remains a highly popular MailOnline\u00a0columnist in both the UK and US. He was appointed editor-at-large of the publication's US operation in September 2014.\u00a0Advertisement",

        "full article": "Cade Cunningham recorded 17 points and eight rebounds to help Oklahoma State register a 72-69 victory over West Virginia on Thursday in the Big 12 tournament quarterfinals at Kansas City. Avery Anderson scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half for the fifth-seeded Cowboys (19-7), who won for the seventh time in the past eight games. Isaac Likekele and Bryce Williams added 10 points apiece and Kalib Boone contributed 10 rebounds and six blocked shots. Miles McBride and Taz Sherman scored 19 points apiece for West Virginia (18-9), which lost for the third time in the past four games. Derek Culver recorded 11 points and nine rebounds and Sean McNeil scored 10 points for the fourth-seeded Mountaineers. Culver played 30 minutes while laboring through a non-COVID illness. He reportedly was given an IV at halftime. Oklahoma State will play the winner of the contest between top-seeded Baylor and ninth-seeded Kansas State in Friday's semifinals. The Cowboys shot 44.3 percent from the field -- including 6 of 19 from 3-point range -- but held a dominating 45-32 rebounding edge. West Virginia shot 42.2 percent and was 7 of 23 from behind the arc. The Mountaineers battled back from a 10-point deficit to take a 69-68 lead on Sherman's 3-pointer with 1:14 remaining. Anderson drove for a layup to put Oklahoma State back ahead with 55.1 seconds left and Williams added two free throws to make it 72-69 with 21.3 seconds remaining. West Virginia had a chance to force overtime but came up empty. Sherman had a 3-point attempt blocked by Likekele and Culver recovered the ball for the Mountaineers and got it to McNeil, who didn't get the shot off in time despite it swishing the net. West Virginia coach Bob Huggins failed for the second straight time in his bid to join Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Boeheim, Bob Knight and Roy Williams as the only male coaches with 900 Division I victories. McBride scored 16 first-half points as the Mountaineers held a 36-30 edge. Culver re-entered with 17:03 remaining in the contest and scored the next two Mountaineers' baskets. He converted another shot to make it 47-39 with 13:35 remaining. Oklahoma State answered with a 16-3 spurt to move ahead. Cunningham buried a 3-pointer to give the Cowboys a 51-50 edge with 10:12 left. Likekele and Anderson added baskets to conclude the flurry and give Oklahoma State a five-point lead. Cunningham's running hook shot made it 62-52 with 6:18 left. The lead was again 10 before Sherman made two 3-pointers and converted a layup following a steal during a 10-1 run to pull West Virginia within 65-64 with 3:55 remaining. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said Fox News host Tucker Carlson \"essentially demeaned the entire U.S. military\" with a segment that decried increasing numbers of female service members and suggested they were weakening the U.S. armed forces. On Tuesday night the conservative commentator showed an Air Force photo of a 1st lieutenant modeling a maternity uniform, and said in the face of a growing threat from China the Pentagon could lose wars by drawing in more women. \"While China's military becomes more masculine ... our military needs to become, as Joe Biden says, more feminine,\" Carlson said. \"This is a mockery of the U.S. military.\" Responding on Thursday, the Pentagon said it was proud of the military's diversity and said it needed to do a better job of promoting women to senior ranks. \"What we absolutely won't do is take personnel advise from a talk show host or the Chinese military,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. Kirby said he hoped Carlson would \"realize the mistake he made and express some regret about the manner in which he essentially demeaned the entire U.S. military and how we defend and how we serve this country.\" Fox News, which is regularly broadcast to service members deployed around the world on the military's own television channel, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While gender diversity in the armed forces has been a stated goal of both Republican and Democratic administrations, women make up only about 16.5% of the active-duty military, a recent Government Accountability Office report found. That number is far lower among senior military officials. This week, Biden nominated only the second and third women to lead combatant commands in the military's history.

Rivera said the money, which was paid in 2012 when Hernandez was head of Honduras' Congress, was delivered in cash to the president\u00b4s now-deceased sister, Hilda. Hernandez, who is listed as a co-conspirator in the indictment of Fuentes Ramirez, has repeatedly denied any involvement in drug trafficking. Fuentes Ramirez pleaded not guilty on Monday. Rivera made a deal with the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2013 and turned himself in around two years later after the United States sanctioned shell companies Rivera said he owned.

        "full article": "By Tina Bellon March 11 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc on Thursday said they would share with each other information on drivers and delivery workers they had banned from their platforms for the most serious incidents in an effort to boost safety. The companies said such incidents would be physical assault resulting in a fatality and the most serious forms of sexual assault, adding they hoped to eventually share such data across the wider transportation and delivery industry. The move comes more than a year after Uber released its first safety report, detailing about 6,000 reports of sexual assault related to 2.3 billion trips in the United States in 2017 and 2018. https://bit.ly/3rFG0En Lyft has vowed to produce a similar report, the publication of which has been delayed several times. Jennifer Brandenburger, Lyft's head of policy development, said the company was awaiting the resolution of a dispute with a California regulator that has demanded detailed information on sexual assault and harassment claims. Uber and Lyft oppose the disclosures, arguing they would violate victims' rights to privacy. While both companies conduct background checks through a third party before allowing drivers to work on their platforms, company executives said that the extreme underreporting of sexual assault means those issues frequently do not get detected. \"The reality is, as our safety report showed, these types of serious safety incidents are extremely rare, less than one tenth of 1% ... so we're talking about a very small number of drivers who will be affected by this\" said Uber's Chief Legal Officer Tony West. Brandenburger said the sharing program was designed to balance safety on the platforms with customer privacy and fairness. The companies will decide in the future whether to broaden the types of safety incidents they share data on, the executives said. (Reporting by Tina Bellon Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

The comparatively wealthy South American nation has been lauded for its handling of the pandemic, and for its orderly roll-out of vaccines, among the fastest in the world. But a recent spike in contagions has once again forced health authorities to announce restrictions on commerce and movement to stem the virus' spread. Pinera's bill, which now heads to Congress for review and approval, includes a \"middle class bonus\" for the equivalent of between about $558 and $836 dollars per beneficiary and an interest-free loan with a one-year grace period. The measure would also include a subsidy for home rental payments. Pinera's center-right government has already introduced a host of other stimulus to combat the economic impact of the virus on its poorest citizens, including spot payments, soft loans, mortgage payment holidays and rent subsidies worth more than 12% of gross domestic product. The government estimates the economy will expand by 5% in 2021, and has said the majority of its population will be vaccinated by June.

        "full article": "The Albany Police Department has been formally notified by Cuomo's office over claims the embattled governor groped a female staffer in an incident that may have 'risen to the level of a crime', officials confirmed Thursday.A spokesperson for the department, Steve Smith, said that police had not received a formal complaint from the alleged victim, who has not been named, but they have reached out to a representative for her.This doesn't mean police have opened a criminal investigation, rather that the department has offered its services to the woman, 'as we would any other report or incident', Smith said.Albany PD said it received the referral from a state official on Wednesday night, shortly after an article was published in the Times Union that detailed the woman's accusations.The female aide, who is said to be much younger than Cuomo, claims the 63-year-old governor summoned her to his residence in the Albany Executive Mansion, where he put his hand under her shirt and fondled her.By Thursday afternoon, New York State Assembly officials confirmed a judiciary committee with subpoena power has been formed to also investigate the claims.\u00a0         The Albany Police Department has been formally notified by Cuomo's office regarding an allegation the embattled governor groped a female staffer in an incident that may have 'risen to the level of a crime'         Smith told the New York Times that the call alerting Albany PD to the latest allegation against Cuomo had initially come from the New York State Police.However, in a statement, Cuomo's acting counsel, Beth Garvey, confirmed it was her who had contacted authorities after a lawyer for the female aide told the governor\u2019s office that the aide did not want to file a report.'As a matter of state policy, when allegations of physical contact are made, the agency informs the complainant that they should contact their local police department,' Garvey clarified. 'If they decline, the agency has an obligation to reach out themselves and inform the department of the allegation.''In this case, the person is represented by counsel and when counsel confirmed the client did not want to make a report, the state notified the police department and gave them the attorney\u2019s information.'While the police department is just following standard procedure by reaching out to the alleged victim, the situation could quickly lead to potential criminal exposure for Cuomo, should the woman wish to pursue charges for unwanted touching.\u00a0   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       'He can no longer serve as governor': Bill de Blasio calls...

Her claims followed on from allegations made by five other women - including four former aides - who have accused Cuomo of either sexual harassment or misconduct.\u00a0Those prior allegations range from instances of Cuomo making inappropriate comments to unwanted physical contact.According to the latest accuser, she\u00a0was summoned by the governor to the Executive Mansion, in Albany, late last year, after Cuomo told her he needed help with his cellphone.With the pair alone on the second floor in his personal residence, Cuomo allegedly closed the door, reached under her shirt and fondled her. The woman then told him to stop.\u00a0\u00a0A female supervisor in Cuomo's office first became aware of the aide's allegations on March 3, when the governor, following multiple allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior, issued a televised statement denying touching anyone inappropriatelyThe aide reportedly became emotional during the governor's address, which the supervisor noticed. The women then told the supervisor about her alleged encounter with the governor months earlier.         The sixth accuser, who has not been named, said her incident occurred late last year at the Executive Mansion in Albany (pictured)The aide hadn't filed a formal complaint, but the allegation was forwarded this week to the state attorney general, which is currently overseeing an investigation into all the harassment allegations against Cuomo.Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan waded in on the mounting allegations against Cuomo on Wednesday, tweeting a statement affirming that any other potential victims who wish to come forward will be properly assisted by police.'The act of speaking out after being victimized can be a deeply painful and traumatic experience,' Sheehan wrote. 'The young woman reference in recent reports has the right to determine who she speaks to regarding her experience and when.'The Attorney General has commenced an investigation into previous allegations against the Governor, and I have the utmost confidence in her ability to investigate this latest report.She continued: 'At this time no criminal complaint involving this matter has been file by the victim with the Albany Police Department, but Chief Hawkins assured me this evening that APD stands ready to assist any victim who seeks to come forward.'\u00a0\u00a0While it remains to be seen whether a criminal investigation will be launched, Cuomo is facing increasing pressure to resign in the wake of the most recent allegation.Earlier Thursday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio directly called for Cuomo to step down as governor during a press briefing, calling his sixth accuser's claims 'deeply troubling' and 'disgusting'.'The latest report, and the fact that we can talk about how many people have been come forward with accusations. It\u2019s not one, it\u2019s not two, it\u2019s not three, it\u2019s not four, it\u2019s not five \u2013 it\u2019s six women who have come forward,' Hizzoner began.'It\u2019s deeply troubling, the specific allegation that the governor called an employee of his - someone who he had power over - he called them to a place and then sexually assaulted her is absolutely unacceptable.'It's is disgusting to me,' de Blasio continued. 'He can no longer serve as governor. It's as simple as that.'\u00a0         Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan waded in on the mounting allegations against Cuomo on Wednesday, tweeting a statement affirming that any other potential victims who wish to come forward with allegations will be properly assisted by police.         De Blasio added that, compounding his stance, was that fact that over the past few weeks, 'so many troubling things' had come out about him, including the allegations of his five other accusers and accusations he actively sought to cover up coronavirus nursing home deaths.'We still don't have the truth about that,' he said of nursing home deaths. 'And their families need and deserve to know the truth.'We know one thing: We know there was a purposeful cover-up and that alone is unacceptable and disqualifying.'These six women have come forward with these powerful and painful stories \u2013 and particularly this most recent report is just disqualifying. He just can\u2019t serve as governor anymore,' de Blasio concluded.\u00a0It was the first time the mayor had directly called for Cuomo's resignation, having continuously skirted the question in recent days and weeks.\u00a0Joining the chorus of outrage was a group of 59 state legislatures who all signed and published a letter demanding Cuomo's immediate resignation earlier Thursday.\u00a0Nineteen senators and 40 Assembly members said in the letter that it was time for Cuomo to go.'In light of the Governor\u00b4s admission of inappropriate behavior and the findings of altered data on nursing home COVID-19 deaths he has lost the confidence of the public and the state legislature, rendering him ineffective in this time of most urgent need,' the letter said. 'It is time for Governor Cuomo to resign.'\u00a0The number of signatories comprise nearly 40 percent of the Democratic Party's total membership in the Assembly and Senate, where it holds firm majorities.Of the 40 signers who serve in the Assembly, if they were all to join forces with the 43 Republicans in the Assembly, they would have seven more votes than the minimum of 76 required to impeach Cuomo.\u00a0       New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday directly called for Andrew Cuomo's resignation for the first time         The group of Senate and Assembly Democrats released a statement Thursday morning demanding Cuomo stand down and be replaced by Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul in the interests of 'the future of New York State'. Pictured the letter        A total of six women have now accused Cuomo of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior, with the five prior allegations\u00a0ranging from making inappropriate comments, to making unwanted physical contact.Cuomo, meanwhile, has denied the allegations and has insisted there is 'no way' he will be resigning.\u00a0At least four accusers - Bennett, Lindsey Boylan, Anna Liss and Karen Hinton - worked for the governor in Albany or during his time in President Bill Clinton's Cabinet.\u00a0Another, Anna Ruch, told The New York Times that she met Cuomo at a friend's wedding where he touched her face and asked to kiss her.'I have never done anything like this,' he said of his sixth accuser's claims. 'The details of this report are gut-wrenching. I am not going to speak to the specifics of this or any other allegation given the ongoing review, but I am confident in the result of the attorney general\u2019s report.'However, in addition to the latest victim, five other woman have also accused Cuomo of sexual harassment, with the allegations ranging from making inappropriate comments, to making unwanted physical contact.\u00a0\u00a0US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) during a radio interview called the new claim against Cuomo 'nauseating,' but did not call for the governor to step down.\u00a0He also appeared to accuse Cuomo of withholding pandemic money from New York City in a separate address, while announcing a\u00a0a massive COVID vaccine push in the Big Apple which will see him hand $32 billion allocated for the shots in the COVID relief bill in December straight to Mayor de Blasio.'There's money for the MTA, there's money for our schools, and there is money for New York City,' the New York Senator said as he appeared with de Blasio during the Mayor's Thursday morning press conference.'With the mayor's guidance and a little bit of prodding, we made sure that money doesn't come through Albany, it goes directly to the city because when Albany gets the money sometimes the city doesn't see all of it.'         Cuomo, meanwhile, has denied the allegations and has insisted there is 'no way' he will be resigning         Senator Chuck Schumer announced a massive COVID vaccine push in New York City on Thursday as he took a swipe at Cuomo amid calls for his resignation       State Attorney General Letitia James has put together an investigative team to probe Cuomo's workplace conduct.The governor has called on lawmakers and the public to await the results of that investigation.Federal investigators are also scrutinizing how his administration handled data concerning COVID-19 outbreaks at nursing homes.Cuomo has been under fire for weeks, beginning with revelations that his administration withheld details from the public about the pandemic's death toll among residents in state nursing homes.Scrutiny of the governor - who received accolades during the height of the coronavirus pandemic for leadership that yielded a book deal and calls for a national political career - intensified when former adviser Boylan, 36, reiterated harassment claims made in December, fleshing them out in a late February blog post.",

        "title": "From gravity to depravity: Isaac Newton was a scientific genius who saved the nation's economy - but he also ruined careers, viciously feuded with friends, and was plagued with obsessive thoughts of sinful sex",
        "full article": "BOOK OF THE WEEKLIFE AFTER GRAVITY: ISAAC NEWTON'S LONDON CAREER\u00a0by Patricia Fara (OUP \u00a325, 288pp)\u00a0So who exactly was Sir Isaac Newton? Legend has it that he invented the catflap, although this is much argued over by historians.In his year as an MP, he spoke only once in the House of Commons, either to ask for a window to be closed, or to ask for a window to be opened. Again, sources differ.But the common view of England\u2019s greatest physicist of the 17th century, and possibly all time, is of an ascetic workaholic holed up in his Cambridge college for 30 years, changing humanity\u2019s view of the world for ever.I did Newtonian mechanics in my applied maths A-level, and although some of it has since been superseded by relativity and quantum mechanics, what remains is a system of great elegance and beauty. F=ma, v=u+at \u2014 these are just two of his greatest hits.         Patricia Fara writes about the final 30 years of Isaac Newton's (pictured) life, when he\u00a0gave up his fellowship and moved to London to live a much more public, political lifePatricia Fara has already written a book about that Newton, the legendary Newton, and the giant brain pulsating within. Now she moves on to his final 30 years, when he extracted himself from his life of solitude, gave up his fellowship and moved to London to live a much more public, political life as Master of the Mint and President of the Royal Society.How did this contemplative introvert seemingly change his personality to \u2018thrive in high society and become extremely rich\u2019, in Fara\u2019s words? With determination and an eye for the main chance, it turns out.Newton was not an easy man. If you were writing his obituary today, you would use the code phrase \u2018He did not suffer fools gladly\u2019. This is why he left Cambridge, where he had been overlooked for higher office, and headed for the bright lights.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       And you thought today's Scottish politics was bloody! Never...    Escape to the country:\u00a0In an age when being gay was illegal,...      Share this article Share   London in the early 18th century was a vibrant, bubbling city full of people trying to get rich as quickly as possible. King William seemed to be the only person who didn\u2019t have any money, because he was constantly fighting endless wars. So Newton was parachuted into the Mint to resuscitate the economy, and did so with some success.I have to admit, I knew nothing of any of this. \u2018Biographers often glide across those London years as if they were an embarrassment, an unfitting epilogue for the career of an intellectual giant,\u2019 writes Fara. \u2018According to standard accounts, Newton sublimated his own intellectual desires for the sake of his country by abandoning the intellectual life he adored and reluctantly devoted his great mind to rescuing the nation\u2019s plummeting currency.\u2019 And making a little for himself, of course. When he died in 1727, aged 84, Newton was worth \u00a332,000, the equivalent of several millions today.         Fara said England\u2019s greatest physicist (pictured) of the 17th century would ruin the lives or careers (often both) of people that he didn't like\u00a0Gradually, a fuller picture emerges. Newton had no interest in literature or art, other than commissioning portraits and busts of himself. He did once go to the opera but walked out after the second act.He had a Lincolnshire accent throughout his life. He was generous to friends and relatives, constantly handing out money, but a vicious feuder.Fara describes him as a \u2018serial slanderer: as soon he had vanquished one opponent, he moved on to the next.\u2019He used to play backgammon with John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal, but they fell out over the ownership of astronomical readings that Flamsteed had made, and friendship swiftly declined to bitter enmity.If Newton didn\u2019t like you, he didn\u2019t just seethe impotently. He tried to destroy your life and your career. Often he managed both.Fara\u2019s story is full of colour: her subject had an eventful life. When he was working at the Tower of London, where the Mint was located, the building was also a prison, the HQ of the Board of Ordnance and a zoo. The smell of the river was bad enough; the smell of the animals was worse. Newton never married and swore to sexual abstinence, but he was tortured by obsessive sexual thoughts. About men or women? Fara doesn\u2019t know, and she\u2019s too careful to speculate.         Newton (pictured) never married and swore to sexual abstinence, insisting he was a virgin all his life, but he was tortured by obsessive sexual thoughts\u00a0Gay activists often claim Newton as one of their own, but Fara just says, \u2018Was Newton gay? is the wrong question to ask,\u2019 and then explains why she is not going to ask it, let alone answer it. She does talk a little, though, about him being \u2018plagued with thoughts of sexual sin\u2019. One reason he hated Roman Catholics so much is that he thought the self-denial of their monks served only to inflame desire.Too much privation, he warned, \u2018brings men to a sort of distraction & madnesse so as to make them think they have visions conversing with \u2019em and sitting upon their knees.\u2019 I bet he was breathing heavily when he wrote that.Newton actually claimed to have been a virgin all his life, and we haven\u2019t a clue whether that is true. There are many gaps in this story, because too much time has passed.\u00a0When she tells you about one or other cache of letters being burnt, you can almost hear her gnashing her teeth in frustration. But that\u2019s the biographer\u2019s burden in a nutshell. Fara, who is a historian of science at Cambridge, has been rather ambitious here.         Life after gravity: Isaac Newton's London Career by Patricia Fara (OUP \u00a325, 288pp)She is not just writing about Newton, she is painting a portrait of the age in which he lived, worked, schmoozed and manoeuvred.To do this she structures her book around a painting by William Hogarth, executed after Newton\u2019s death, in which a marble bust of the great man looks down on a drawing room full of his friends, associates and proteges. It\u2019s a clever device that brings many otherwise disparate themes and stories together.She also writes with an elegance and a wit you don\u2019t generally associate with history books.Of George I and George II she writes, \u2018They enjoyed being soldiers, slept with other men\u2019s wives, had few intellectual interests, ate too much and attended church out of duty rather than devotion.\u2018Both Georges were also arrogant, obstinate and hot-tempered: when George II was angry, he kicked his wig round the room like a football.\u2019 How unlike the home life of our own dear Queen.In fact, the thought that came to me about two-thirds of the way through was this: did she actually like Newton?There are pointed comments aplenty, and there\u2019s no attempt to burnish the legend. In the end I felt she admired him wholeheartedly but didn\u2019t care for him much.This is the biographer\u2019s other burden \u2014 coming to dislike the person you are writing about \u2014 but not the reader\u2019s, not at all.",

        "title": "Savannah expects St. Patrick's crowds, possible virus surge",
        "full article": "SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) - The South's largest St. Patrick's Day parade is canceled, as is the boozy riverside festival that accompanies it. Regardless, Savannah is preparing for its largest crowds since the yearlong pandemic began - an influx that officials worry could bring a surge in coronavirus infections. The Irish holiday typically means Savannah's manicured squares and magnolia-shaded sidewalks are packed with thousands of gaudy green revelers on March 17. But with Georgia still reporting at least 1,000 new COVID-19 infections daily while ranking last in U.S. vaccinations, city officials pulled the plug on this year's parade - as they did a year ago when the pandemic was starting. Likewise, Savannah City Hall withheld a permit for the sprawling St. Patrick's festival that's typically a magnet for beer-fueled revelry along the city's riverfront promenade of bars and souvenir shops. But sidelining Savannah's largest gatherings hasn't stopped the party. The city's top tourism official says hotels in the downtown historic district could be 90% full this weekend - the busiest they've been in the past year. \"People know that Savannah is a St. Patrick's Day destination, they know the holiday is in the middle of the week and they\u00b4re going to come the weekend before and after,\" said Joe Marinelli, president of Visit Savannah, the city's tourism bureau. He added that \"COVID fatigue and pent up demand\" for vacations are helping drive visitation. Meanwhile, the owner of a new $375 million hotel and nightlife development that covers 1/4 of a mile (0.4 kilometers) along the riverfront is promoting a festival beginning Friday with live music, a large fountain synchronized to Irish music and green lights illuminating the complex built from a shuttered power plant.          Sarah Hardilek uses a mechanical lift to hang green streamers for St. Patrick's Day at the Plant Riverside hotel and entertainment complex in Savannah, Ga., on Thursday, March 11, 2021. Savannah officials have cancelled the South's largest St. Patrick's Day parade for a second year because of the coronavirus. Regardless, big crowds are expected for the Irish holiday, raising concerns that Savannah's celebration could cause an outbreak. (AP Photo/Russ Bynum)  Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said the planned festivities at the Plant Riverside development are \"a slap in the face\" to the city's efforts to curb coronavirus infections by foregoing events that draw big crowds. \"To advertise this huge festival with the intent of drawing people to a particular space in the middle of a pandemic, when we know social distancing and mask wearing is not going to be enforced, is horrible as far as I\u00b4m concerned,\" Johnson said in an interview. The hotel and entertainment complex hosting the big festival sits on 4 acres (1.6 hectares) of private property, so it doesn't require a city event permit. Still, the mayor said he could use police to block public access to city-owned routes to the festival property if crowds pose a public health risk. Dr. Lawton Davis, director of the Georgia Department of Public Health's coastal district, said big crowds filled with visitors could also spread coronavirus variants that otherwise haven't come to Savannah. \"Anytime there\u00b4s a big influx of people from elsewhere, or just big crowds that are going to be partying to some extent, I get concerns that we\u00b4re going to set ourselves up for a superspreader event,\" Davis said. Organizers of the Plant Riverside events insist they can safely manage a big street party. Mark Castriota, the development's managing director, said its staff will \"strongly encourage all guests to wear face masks and to practice social distancing.\" \"We want to provide an opportunity for people to have fun in a safe environment as part of a new St. Patrick\u00b4s Day tradition in Savannah,\" Castriota said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \"We take safety very seriously and will encourage attendees to comply with all City of Savannah requirements and CDC guidelines.\" Savannah's mayor says police will be enforcing a citywide mask mandate among St. Patrick's crowds, with violators facing possible $500 fines. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's standing emergency order prohibits gatherings of more than 50 people unless social distancing is observed. Restaurants can open without capacity restrictions, but must distance tables. Bars and nightclubs can admit at least 50 people without restriction. The St. Patrick's Day celebration arrives as Georgia ranks last in the nation for vaccinating its population against the virus, with just 17.5% of adults statewide having received at least one shot, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. City Hall hasn't been alone in pushing for increased caution during St. Patrick's Day events. The private committee that organizes the city's 197-year-old parade opted to hold some events without crowds and stream them online - including Friday's ceremony to dye fountain waters in Forsyth Park a glittering emerald green, which usually draws hundreds of cheering onlookers. Despite the lingering health risks, Savannah's hotels and shops, bars and restaurants are hungry for tourism dollars after a punishing 2020. Marinelli of Visit Savannah said business began rebounding last summer, but taxes collected on hotel and motel stays in Savannah plummeted by 50% overall in 2020. \"Last year hurt a lot,\" Marinelli said. \"We really need this one badly.\"",

        "full article": "Smoke rises from a clothing factory in Cairo, where at least 20 people were killed and more than 24 others injured  At least 20 people were killed and 24 others injured Thursday in a clothing factory fire on the eastern outskirts of the Egyptian capital, medical and security sources told AFP. Twelve fire trucks were dispatched to extinguish the huge blaze as smoke billowed out over the industrial area called Al-Obour, with the cause not immediately clear. The state prosecutor has tasked a team with investigating the fire in the four-storey factory, the sources added. A survivor who suffered burns to about 25 percent of his body said he was nearly overcome by smoke inhalation when he escaped the inferno. \"I had two young women with me and a young man who I pushed so they could avoid the blaze,\" Mahmoud Mohamed said, quoted by Al Youm al-Sabea newspaper. \"I led them outside, running as the fire burned my body,\" said the young man who had been working at the factory for a year. Acrid clouds of smoke swirled in the streets, forcing passersby to wrap clothing around their face to protect them from the fumes. Egypt's textile union paid tribute to the factory workers who were killed and injured during the blaze, in a statement issued later. The Arab world's most populous country has had a string of fires in recent years, as shoddy buildings have been constructed without safety standards amid a security vacuum following its 2011 revolution. Last month, a fire in an unlicenced shoe warehouse in the capital's twin city Giza engulfed a 13-storey building overlooking a major highway. Residents were evacuated but no casualties were reported. In May 2020, another fire in a mattress factory in the same industrial area broke out with no loss of life reported at the time. In the same year, a fire erupted next to a busy Cairo highway as a leak from an oil pipeline set ablaze by passing cars left 17 people hurt. A year earlier, at least 10 people were killed when a chemical tank exploded at a phosphates factory in the Red Sea port of Ain Sokhna.",

The massive storm is expected to dump up to two feet (61 cm) of snow and winds of up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) to parts of northern Colorado, southeast Wyoming and western Nebraska from late Thursday through late Sunday, the National Weather Service said. \"It's will be a impactful, strong storm, but I wouldn't call it a blizzard right now,\" said Colorado-based NWS meteorologist Lisa Kriederman. \"This is a very wet system. We could experience some tree damage and power outages so people need to be prepared.\" In a tweet, the Colorado Department of Transportation strongly urged motorists to avoid traveling during the storm as snowfall totals could reach four feet in higher elevations of the Rocky Mountains. The storm is also expected to bring cold rain and snow to parts of the eastern Great Plains, forecasters said. \"The wet snow and cold rain could be hazardous to young livestock,\" the NWS service said in advisories for parts of Nebraska. The storm could rival the spring blizzard of 2003, when seven feet of snow fell on parts of the area, stranding skiers, shutting down highways and closing the Denver International Airport, leaving thousands of travelers stuck for days. Fort Collins, Colorado is forecast to get 30 inches of snow over the weekend, a total that it has seen only once before during the 2003 blizzard, according to the Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University. \"Shaping up to be a historic snowstorm,\" the center said in a tweet.

In a LinkedIn post, Reuss also called on U.S. policymakers to invest \"in infrastructure that includes fast-charging stations, particularly in urban areas and along highway corridors.\" In January, GM said it was setting a dramatic goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift by the largest U.S. automaker away from gasoline and diesel engines. \"2021 is the tipping point toward EVs,\" Reuss said Thursday in his post. Reuss also called again for the $7,500-EV tax credit to be extended to more vehicles. GM hit the 200,000 cumulative EV vehicle sales threshold in late 2018 and the credit fully expired for all GM EV buyers in April 2020. GM sold 2.55 million vehicles in the United States last year, but only about 20,000 were EVs, including the Chevy Bolt hatchback. It said in November it was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, up from $20 billion planned before the coronavirus pandemic. Total U.S. EV sales in 2020 fell to 296,000, down from 331,000 in 2019, according to S&amp;P Global Platts, accounting for 2% of total U.S. vehicle sales. President Joe Biden has called for 500,000 new charging stations to speed electric vehicle adoption and backs expanding tax credits for consumers and for retool factories to build EVs and components. During a Washington Post forum Thursday, Reuss said the company was focused on EVs. \"We definitely bet the future on battery electric vehicles - not plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,\" Reuss said. \"We're going all the way. We're going as fast as we can. That's the bet we have.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",

        "full article": "MILAN, March 11 (Reuters) - Former Fiat Chrysler premium car brands Alfa Romeo and Lancia will enjoy stronger investments under Stellantis, the new automaker formed from the merger with France's PSA, Stellantis Chairman John Elkann said in a TV interview. With 14 brands under one roof, Stellantis is the world's fourth largest carmaker. It was officially born in January, as Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Peugeot maker completed their long awaited merger. Asked about what role FCA's hometown of Turin would play in Stellantis, Elkann told Italian State TV Rai that, as part of a bigger group, it would have greater opportunities. \"We've seen it clearly with some brands like Alfa Romeo and Lancia, on which we could not invest or give resources as much as we wanted in recent years,\" said Elkann, who led FCA into the PSA merger as chairman of the Italian American automaker. \"In this new group there will be much greater opportunities than in the past for these two brands, which are based in Turin,\" he said. Stellantis is creating a pool with Alfa Romeo, Lancia and former PSA's DS brand to cooperate on the premium market. (Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

        "full article": "By Kate Abnett BRUSSELS, March 11 (Reuters) - The European Commission has come under fresh pressure to change its planned rules on what counts as a sustainable investment, with 10 EU countries saying the criteria for bioenergy are too restrictive. Brussels is facing resistance on multiple fronts to its sustainable finance taxonomy, a list of economic activities that from next year will define what can be labelled as \"green\" investments. The rules aim to steer much-needed cash into genuinely sustainable projects but, with countries pushing back on planned rules for natural gas and bioenergy, the European Union has delayed finishing them to late April. In a letter dated March 10, ten countries urged the Commission to change its proposal on power produced from bioenergy - products such as forest residues or agricultural waste. \"All forms of solid, gaseous and liquid bioenergy fuels that are sustainable under the Renewable Energy Directive must be declared long-term sustainable energy sources,\" said the letter, signed by ministers from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden. To qualify as a sustainable investment, the Commission had said bioenergy should meet tougher criteria than it currently faces under existing EU renewable energy rules. That included an 80% saving in greenhouse gas emissions compared with fossil fuels -- beyond the 70% saving currently required for bioenergy to be classed as renewable. Introducing tougher criteria for bioenergy \"counteracts\" the EU's aim to promote investments in renewable energy, the letter said. \"The Commission\u00b4s proposal on bioenergy should be revised,\" said Anders Ygeman, energy minister for Sweden, which has the most forest area of any EU country. The countries' position was at odds with that of campaigners. Green group WWF said the Commission's proposal should in fact be made more restrictive, to avoid some high-emitting types of bioenergy being classed as a sustainable investment.

        "full article": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Thomas Davis and Greg Olsen, two beloved NFL players who developed into iconic figures in the Charlotte community, officially retired together on Thursday as members of the Carolina Panthers. Davis and Olsen signed one-day contracts with Carolina and were honored jointly during a 90-minute virtual ceremony at Bank of America Stadium that was broadcast live on the team\u00b4s website. \"For the people here in Carolina, you guys are family -- and I\u00b4m glad you guys came back home today,\" Panthers owner David Tepper said. Davis spent 14 of his 16 NFL seasons with the Panthers and is the team\u00b4s franchise leader in tackles with 1,258. Olsen spent nine of his 14 seasons in Carolina, finishing with 742 receptions for 8,683 yards, both fifth most in NFL history among tight ends. But their success on the field was superseded by their reputation for giving back to the Charlotte community. Davis was the Walter Payton Man of the Year award recipient in 2014, while Olsen was selected as a finalist for the award in 2017 and 2018.

Linebacker Thomas Davis and tight end Greg Olsen are signing one-day contracts to retire as members of the Carolina Panthers. A retirement news videoconference is set for March 11. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)  Davis started the Defending Dreams Foundation which strives to encourage students to develop the essential life and social skills that will make them leaders of the community. Olsen created the HEARTest Yard Fund foundation along with Atrium Health to help other families after his son T.J. was diagnosed early in his life with a congenital heart condition. \"They understand there is more to life than just football,\" said Washington Football Team coach Ron Rivera, who coached both players with the Panthers. \"They both used their platforms for positive impact in the community.\" On the field, both were team captains and viewed as ultra-competitive warriors that helped the Panthers reach the Super Bowl in 2015 and finish 17-2. Davis was the emotional lifeblood of the team on defense, while Olsen was the cerebral leader on offense. Davis said he never would have realized his full potential had it not been for former Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, who believed in him after he suffered his third torn ACL in 2011. Davis persevered and went on to play nine more seasons in the league. \"He told me, `I believe in you and if you\u00b4re willing to put yourself through it, I'm willing to give you that opportunity,'\" Davis said of that meeting with Richardson a decade ago. \"In life just knowing that you have somebody who believes in you, just knowing that you have an opportunity, that you have a chance - and I took it and I ran with it. The best years of my career all happened after I tore my ACL for a third time.\" Former Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart said Davis is the picture of perseverance. \"Everything you have overcome and all of adversity, this is what you were built for - you were built to inspire people,\" Stewart said. Olsen played his first four seasons for the Chicago Bears and said he was \"mad and bitter\" when he was traded to Carolina before the 2011 season. He later said it was it was the best thing that could have happened to him. After hearing of the trade, former Panthers linebacker Jon Beason began telling Davis how great Olsen was going to be in Carolina. Davis jokingly replied, \"I am thinking that is a white tight end -- ain\u00b4t no way he\u00b4s that fast.\" But Olsen proved everyone wrong with something he learned from his father, Chris, his high school football coach. \"I was never the best athlete, I was never the fastest guy and I was never the most talented guy - but no one was ever going to outwork me,\" Olsen said. \"No one was ever going to outfight me. And that was the way we were expected to play and expected to live every day of our lives.\" ___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL          FILE - Carolina Panthers tight end Greg Olsen (88) watches during an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals in Glendale, Ariz., in this Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, file photo.

        "full article": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Avery Anderson III hit the go-ahead bucket for Oklahoma State with less than a minute to go, and Sean McNeil's tying 3-pointer came a split-second after the final buzzer, allowing the No. 12 Cowboys to escape with a 72-69 win over No. 10 West Virginia in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals Thursday. Anderson and Big 12 player of the year Cade Cunningham had 17 points apiece for the fifth-seeded Cowboys (19-7), who have won seven of their last eight games - including two against the Mountaineers - with the only loss to No. 2 Baylor. Isaac Likekele and Bryce Williams each added 10 points to help the Cowboys reach the semifinal round, where they will face the top-seeded Bears or No. 9 seed Kansas State for a spot in Saturday's championship game. Taz Sherman had given West Virginia (19-8) a 69-68 lead with his 3-pointer with 1:12 to go, but Anderson answered at the other end for Oklahoma State. The Mountaineers squandered a chance to retake the lead when Miles McBride and Emmitt Matthews missed near the bucket, and Williams calmly hit two free throws with 21.3 seconds left to extend the lead. The Mountaineers drew up a play to get Sherman an open 3 from the corner in the final seconds, but he misfired and the ball found its way to McNeil. He threw a pump fake to get a defender in the air, and the moment it took to do that cost him a chance at the winner - the buzzer had sounded by the time he released his own 3 and it splashed through the net. McBride and Sherman finished with 19 points apiece for West Virginia. Derek Culver added 11 points and nine boards.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The teams split their regular-season meetings with West Virginia rallying from 19 down to win in Stillwater and Oklahoma State edging the Mountaineers last week in Morgantown without Cunningham or Likekele at their disposal. Made sense that they would play another nip-and-tuck affair in the Big 12 Tournament. Both teams were sloppy at the start, and neither gained separation until a disastrous final minute for the Cowboys. It began when Sean McNeil bounced a 3-pointer about a half-dozen times on the rim before it fell and Cowboys coach Mike Boynton called a timeout with 28 seconds left in the half. Instead of getting a final shot, though, Cunningham turned it over and McBride coasted for a layup. Then the West Virginia guard stripped Keylan Boone and dunked at the buzzer. Rather than a chance at the halftime lead, Oklahoma State trailed 36-30 at the break. The Mountaineers pushed the lead to eight and were still in control until Williams hit a 3-pointer with 12:25 to go, triggering a 14-point run interrupted only by McBride's lone free throw. West Virginia coach Bob Huggins called a timeout to try to slow it down, but Likekele and Anderson responded with breakaway buckets to keep it going. The Cowboys' lead reached 64-54 with 5 1/2 minutes to go before Sherman got involved. The Mountaineers' senior guard followed back-to-back 3-pointers with another basket, pulling back almost all of their deficit in a matter of 90 seconds and setting up a frantic final few minutes. BIG PICTURE Oklahoma State got Cunningham back from an ankle injury sustained against Baylor, and Likekele was back after missing a series of games with a nagging foot injury. Both played pivotal roles in advancing to the next round. West Virginia couldn't overcome 15 turnovers while the Cowboys managed to survive 20 of their own. They also struggled to get baskets in the paint, resorting to outside shooting as they tried to come back down the stretch.

        "title": "IRS says new round of COVID relief payments on the way",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Along with daylight saving time, this weekend could bring some Americans fatter bank balances. Officials at the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service said Friday that processing of the new round of stimulus payments has already begun, with the aim of having the first payments start showing up in bank accounts this weekend. President Joe Biden signed the new $1.9 trillion rescue package on Thursday, the day after it won final passage in the House. The measure provides for payments to qualifying individuals of up to $1,400, with payments to a qualifying family of four of $5,600. \"The payments will be delivered automatically to taxpayers even as the IRS continues delivering regular tax refunds,\" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. It is estimated that 85% of Americans will be eligible for the payments and the goal is to have millions of the payments disbursed in the next few weeks. The relief measure, which passed on party-line votes in both the House and Senate, contains the third round of economic-impact payments. The first round passed last spring provided up to $1,200 per individual, and a second round of payments in December provided up to $600 per individual.          FILE - This May 8, 2008, file photo shows blank checks on an idle press at the Philadelphia Regional Financial Center, which disburses payments on behalf of federal agencies in Philadelphia. Officials at the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service said Friday, March 12, 2021 that processing the new round of stimulus payments has already begun, with the aim of having the first payments start showing up in bank accounts this weekend. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)  The latest package passed with no votes from Republicans, who objected to the size of the measure and argued it was not necessary given signs that the economy is beginning to recover. Then-President Donald Trump called the payments in the $900 billion relief bill passed in December too small and Biden agreed, pushing the total for an individual up to $1,400 in the new package. The latest round of relief payments will provide households with $1,400 for each adult, child and adult dependent, such as college students or elderly relatives. Adult dependents were not eligible to receive payments in the previous two rounds of payments. The payments start declining for an individual once adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 and go to zero once income hits $80,000. The payment starts declining for married couples when income exceeds $150,000 and goes to zero at $160,000. Officials said that beginning on Monday, people can check the \"Get My Payment\" tool on the IRS.gov website to track their own payments. Taxpayers who have provided bank information with the IRS will receive the direct-deposit payments, while others will get paper checks or debit cards mailed to them. Officials said in the interest of speeding up the relief payments, the IRS will use the latest tax return available, either the 2019 return filed last year or the 2020 return that is due by April 15. If a person's job situation changed last year because of the pandemic, which led to millions of people losing jobs or being forced to work reduced hours, officials said that the IRS will adjust the size of the new impact payments after the 2020 return has been filed and provide a supplemental payment if that is called for. Officials said those adjustments will be made automatically by the IRS for people who have already filed their 2020 returns. Officials said they wanted to handle the payments this way rather than waiting for the 2020 tax return to be filed in the interest of speeding payments to taxpayers. ___ This story has been corrected to show that individuals received up to $1,200 in the first round of stimulus payments, not $2,000.",

Defender Thiago Silva has experienced a minor recurrence of a prior thigh problem, so will also miss the game at Elland Road. Chelsea is in the fourth Champions League spot, two points ahead of West Ham, which has a game in hand. Everton is two points further back going into its game against Burnley. Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure has been ruled out for up to 10 weeks with a broken bone in a foot while playmaker James Rodriguez will not play again until after next month due to a calf problem. Manchester City is 14 points clear in first place before traveling to Fulham, which has lost just one of its last seven games and is only in the relegation zone on goal difference. West Bromwich Albion, which is eight points from safety, plays Crystal Palace having drawn four of its last eight league games. Palace is eight points clear of the bottom three. SPAIN Leader Atletico Madrid crosses the capital to face a struggling Getafe looking to strengthen its six-point advantage over second-placed Barcelona with 12 rounds remaining. Diego Simeone insists his Atletico team is completely focused on the derby that comes four days before it hosts Chelsea needing to overturn a 1-0 deficit in the Champions League round-of-16. Atl\u00e9tico has won its last six visits to Getafe without conceding a single goal. Third-placed Real Madrid is eight points behind Atl\u00e9tico and cannot afford a slip when it hosts Elche.

The clubs have met 109 times, and Bremen has a pressing problem ahead of the 110th clash - how to stop Bayern star Robert Lewandowski. The Poland forward is on 31 goals from 24 rounds and closing in on Gerd M\u00fcller\u00b4s 49-year-old record of 40 in a season. Ten rounds remain including this weekend. Bremen has carved out some breathing space in its battle against relegation with two wins and a draw from its last three games. Florian Kohfeldt\u00b4s team is 11 points clear of the relegation zone. Bayern\u00b4s lead has been cut to two points and it can ill-afford any slipups with second-place Leipzig on a six-game winning run in the league. (Leipzig plays fourth-place Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday.) Borussia Dortmund hosts Hertha Berlin in Saturday\u00b4s late game. Also, Union Berlin welcomes Cologne, Freiburg visits Mainz, and Wolfsburg hosts last-place Schalke. FRANCE Jorge Sampaoli takes charge of his second game for Marseille when they face Brest at home. The Argentine coach will hope for an improved performance after a late goal sealed a scrappy midweek home win against a struggling Rennes team. Sampaoli has 10 games to lead a late charge and get Marseille into the Europa League, and he will hope playmaker Dimitri Payet recaptures his best form to help that push. If Marseille loses at Stade Velodrome, then Angers can move level on points with a home win against Saint-Etienne, which is hovering just above the relegation zone. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

Under the third stage of the \"roadmap\", very large outdoor stadiums will - if all conditions are met - from May 17 be able to have up to 10,000 people or 25% capacity, whichever is lower. \"Hopefully the final two fixtures of our season will have up to 10,000 supporters in them all,\" Masters was quoted as saying by the BBC. \"We've got to go past those first initial steps in the government's roadmap to get there, so hopefully that will be a fantastic finale to end the season.\" The current fixture schedule has May 15 and 23 listed as the final two weekends of the Premier League season. Masters said the suspension of the 2019-20 season and the absence of fans amid the COVID-19 crisis came at a heavy cost. Stadiums in some parts of England briefly opened up to a limited number of fans in December but the government imposed another lockdown after a new wave of COVID-19 infections. \"Towards the end of this season we'll get towards 2 billion pounds ($2.78 billion) lost since the start of the pandemic in matchday and broadcast revenue,\" said Masters. \"Clubs have continued to invest in competitive match-day squads and the Premier League has continued to make good all of its contributions throughout the pyramid and wider football. \"But the ramifications are that ultimately if there's less money coming into football, then there'll be less money going out in the short term.\" Should the vaccination programme in the UK go according to plan, Masters is optimistic football in Britain could be back to normal next season. \"From the beginning of next season, our goal is to have full stadia and the Government\u00b4s roadmap offers us that opportunity,\" he explained. Masters also said players will continue to take a knee until the end of the season as the 'No Room for Racism' campaign continues to seek positive changes in football and society. \"You will see for the rest of this season more anti-racism messages on player's shirts and the continuation of taking the knee until the end of the season,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We will discuss with the players in the close season what we are going to do to continue to make our feelings clear about anti-discrimination messaging going forward.\" ($1 = 0.7183 pounds) (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris)",

        "title": "First U.S. stimulus payments to hit bank accounts this weekend -officials",
        "full article": "By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Americans will see the first direct deposits from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package hit their bank accounts this weekend, Treasury and Internal Revenue Service officials said on Friday. A first tranche of $1,400 stimulus payments was processed Friday, with additional large batches of payments to be sent via direct deposits or through the mail as checks or debit cards in coming weeks, the officials said. That means a family of four earning up to $150,000 will receive $5,600. Unlike the first two payments, which were limited to children under 17, this round of checks will also go to all qualifying dependents, including college students, adults with disabilities, parents and grandparents, the officials said. They stressed that no action was required by taxpayers to receive the payments, which will be based on 2019 or 2020 tax returns, depending on which was the latest filed, or data supplied to the IRS last year by non-filers. The IRS will also automatically send payments to those who typically do not file tax returns, but received Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board benefits, Supplemental Security Income or Veteran benefits in 2020, they said. \"The goals is to get these out at fast as possible,\" said one of the officials. Beginning Monday, taxpayers can log onto the Get My Payment https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment tool on the IRS website to check the status of these payments. Officials urged people to file their tax returns electronically to ease the process, noting they could also qualify for other relief, including child tax credits. The Biden administration said stimulus payments and other measures will boost economic growth and help Americans hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is continuing to claim 1,400 lives in the United States each day. Nearly 160 million U.S. households will receive some $400 billion in direct payments of $1,400 per person, helping individuals earning up to $75,000 annually and couples up to $150,000. Those earning more, but less than $80,000 per individual or $160,000 per couple, will receive reduced amounts. Officials said they were coordinating with the Social Security Administration, other government agencies and financial institutions to avoid problems seen during the last round of stimulus payments, when checks went out to thousands of people who were deceased. \"We have a number of controls in place to make sure that we check and look at how those payments are going out,\" said one of the officials.

        "full article": "Arizona Diamondbacks first base coach Dave McKay is recovering after he sustained a broken rib and a lacerated spleen in a dugout fall earlier this week. Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said McKay tripped on the bottom step of the visitor's dugout on Monday and fell into a metal railing during a spring training game against the San Francisco Giants in Scottsdale, Ariz. McKay handled his duties on Tuesday but reported he was feeling more pain on Wednesday. The extent of the injuries were discovered and Lovullo said McKay underwent a procedure on his spleen and was hoping to be released from the hospital on Friday. \"It's going to probably be a week, at least, before we see him active at camp,\" Lovullo told reporters on Friday. \"But he's OK and this is just all precautionary. He'll be ready for the season. And in true Dave form, when he was calling to tell me that he was not feeling so well and he was going to need to have a procedure, he said, 'I probably will not make the game tonight, but I'll be ready tomorrow.' That's his mindset.\" Opening Day for the Diamondbacks is April 1 against the host San Diego Padres. Infield coordinator Gil Velazquez is handling first-base coaching duties during McKay's absence. McKay, who turns 71 on Sunday, has been with the Diamondbacks since 2014. He played eight major league seasons with the Minnesota Twins (1975-76), Toronto Blue Jays (1977-79) and Oakland Athletics (1980-82) before spending the 1983 season in the minors. He began his coaching career the following season and was on the Oakland staff from 1984-95 before spending the next 16 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals (1996-2011). He spent two seasons with the Chicago Cubs (2012-13) before joining Arizona's staff. Shortstop Nick Ahmed doesn't expect McKay to be hindered for long. \"He's a trooper,\" Ahmed, who turns 31 on Monday, said of McKay. \"He takes care of himself super well and we know he's going to bounce back great. But for me, as someone who takes care of my health and enjoys that aspect of life, he's kind of like up on a pedestal. So I'm chasing David. I'm trying to be better than he is at 70. \"So, we'll see what happens. I got a bunch of years to go, but our birthdays are pretty close, so we talked about it quite a bit here.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "SAN DIEGO (AP) - A former San Diego County sheriff\u00b4s captain who used his law enforcement credentials to run a gun trafficking business was sentenced Friday to two years in prison by a federal judge who said his arrogance was comparable to \"a mob boss of sorts.\" Former San Diego County Sheriff\u00b4s Captain Marco Garmo pleaded guilty in September that he had acted as an unlicensed firearm dealer, buying almost 150 weapons and reselling nearly 100 over a period of roughly six years. A number of those transactions involved \"straw purchases,\" where Garmo acquired firearms for others since law enforcement officers are exempt from California's limits on certain newer handguns. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said Garmo was \"almost becoming a mob boss of sorts\" in picking winners and losers and dispensing unlawful favors to friends and family. Garmo's lawyers could not be immediately reached for comment. In his plea agreement, Garmo admitted that one of his goals in selling so many guns was profit, but another was to curry favor with prominent county residents whom he expected might support his planned run for San Diego County sheriff. Garmo also acknowledged tipping off his cousin who was part owner of an illegal marijuana dispensary that it was about to be searched by deputies, prompting the illicit business to clear its shelves, according to the complaint. Weeks later, Garmo helped his cousin again after the business got an abatement notice, requiring it to shut down. Garmo reached out to a county employee and asked, \"Can we push it back?\" They replied, \"Yes you can.\" Garmo helped another illegal dispensary to stay open, working out a deal to receive 10% in fees for his efforts, according to prosecutors. \"This investigation uncovered blatant and repetitive violations of the public trust by a senior law enforcement officer,\" Attorney for the United States Linda Frakes said in a statement. Garmo was a deputy for the San Diego County Sheriff\u00b4s Department for almost 27 years until Sept. 20, 2019. His arrest in 2019 was among a string of cases involving current and former law enforcement officers in Southern California accused of illegal firearm sales. They included two Los Angeles area police officers who were convicted of making illegal gun sales, including one to a convicted felon. Also in 2019, a former Pasadena police lieutenant was sentenced to more than a year in federal prison for illegally selling more than 100 guns.",

        "full article": "Ohio State junior guard Duane Washington Jr. had a reminder for the media Friday after the No. 9 Buckeyes' 87-78 overtime win over Purdue in the quarterfinal of the Big Ten tournament. The victory gave the fifth-seeded Buckeyes (20-8) the rematch they wanted, playing fourth-ranked and top seed Michigan (20-3) in the semifinals Saturday in Indianapolis. The championship game is Sunday afternoon. The Wolverines won the first matchup 92-87 in Columbus, Ohio, on Feb. 21. The loss sent the Buckeyes into a four-game losing streak that ended Thursday when they edged Minnesota to open their tourney play. \"They're a very good team,\" Washington said. \"I told you guys in another interview that we're going to see them again, and here it is. We're super excited.\" While the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry is big, the Wolverines are coming off an intense 79-66 victory over Maryland in which coach Juwan Howard received two technicals and was ejected midway through the second half after jawing with Maryland coach Mark Turgeon during a timeout. Howard charged his counterpart after he said Turgeon told him not to talk to him. After Howard received two technical and Turgeon one, the Big Ten announced a few hours later that no further action would be taken against either team or their coaches. The Wolverines were undeterred by the encounter, as Mike Smith led the way with a season-high 18 points and a tournament-record 15 assists. \"He's a great player. He is really good and really fast,\" Turgeon said. \"They are just an unbelievably well-put-together basketball team. They can score and they can defend. They've got great size. They've got inside game; they've got outside game.\" Smith said the key against the Terrapins, as it will be vs. the Buckeyes, is to play with tempo. \"I'm really fast and today it showed,\" he said. \"Coach said, `It's going to be an up and down game and if we run with pace, we'll win the game.'\" Ohio State started and ended well against Purdue, jumping to an 18-point halftime lead, blowing all of it, then having to go overtime before closing out the win. A big reason for the meltdown was losing senior forward Kyle Young to a possible concussion early in the second half after an inadvertent elbow by Purdue's Trevion Williams. Young had tied his career high with 18 points, all in the first half. His status for Saturday is uncertain. \"You saw the effect Kyle had on the game, the impact,\" Ohio State guard E.J. Liddell said. \"We picked him up and got the W for him.\" Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann knows Michigan may have an advantage having played one game in the tournament while the Buckeyes will be on the Lucas Oil Stadium court for the third time in less than 72 hours. \"Well, I think (my players) are still feeling this, coming down a little bit from this one,\" he said. \"They do understand we're playing a terrific Michigan team that's well coached and really, really good. \"We've got to get our legs under us and be able to respond to a team that is really a complete team offensively and defensively.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "Steve Bruce has warned his Newcastle players to buckle themselves in for a rollercoaster ride as they attempt to drag themselves away from Premier League relegation trouble. The Magpies looked to be heading for another damaging home defeat before skipper Jamaal Lascelles struck at the death to deny Aston Villa victory on Tyneside on Friday night, in the process edging them two points clear of the bottom three. Fulham host leaders Manchester City on Saturday, with Newcastle\u2019s next opponents Brighton heading for Southampton the following day, but head coach Bruce is taking nothing for granted. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go yet. The tickly bit hasn\u2019t come upon us just yet, so we\u2019ve got all that to look forward to. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big, huge game, as we know, next week, but 10, 11 games to go, it\u2019s still all to play for.\u201d Lascelles struck in the fourth minute of stoppage time with a bullet header from substitute Jacob Murphy\u2019s cross to rescue a point just when it looked as though Newcastle\u2019s luck had deserted them once again. With star men Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almiron all missing through injury \u2013 Villa were without talisman Jack Grealish because of illness \u2013 they saw a chance to take the lead elude them when Murphy\u2019s 83rd-minute shot came back off the crossbar. #NEWAVL was only the 3rd instance in #PL history of a team scoring first as late as the 86th minute in an away match and not going on to win pic.twitter.com/cTVbUnUaJL\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) March 12, 2021   To make matters worse, they fell behind three minutes later when Ollie Watkins\u2019 header hit defender Ciaran Clark and looped into the net off the underside of the bar, leaving them staring at an 11th defeat in 17 league games. Bruce said: \u201cTo get off the the floor the way they have after the hideous goal they have conceded, the way they\u2019ve gone about their work tonight\u2026 \u201cI thought we were marginally the better side and had the better opportunities and it would have been cruel if we hadn\u2019t have got something from the match.\u201d Villa counterpart Dean Smith was understandably disappointed that his side had not managed to make the most of their good fortune by hanging on for the win. Asked if it was a point gained or two dropped, Smith said: \u201cIt\u2019s two dropped from scoring in the 89th minute or whatever it was. \u201cWe were fortunate to score the goal, but you certainly take those and then we should go and see the game out. \u201cWe got a great opportunity to get a three or four v one and go and finish the game off to make it 2-0 and we messed that up, and then we messed a few clearances up and they end up scoring with 10 seconds to go, so we\u2019re disappointed.\u201d Smith faces an anxious wait too over midfielder Bertrand Traore, who appeared to damage his ribs in a first-half collision with the advertising hoardings at St James\u2019 Park. He said: \u201cHe went over the billboards and whacked himself and it was too painful to continue. He\u2019s been a bit of a trouper this season, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how he is now.\u201d",

Perhaps not so happy for Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims that as a 17-year-old she was pressured to have sex there with Prince Andrew, an allegation he denies.\u00a0 Katy is blooming with her little DaisyCradling their six-month-old daughter Daisy Dove while frolicking in Hawaii with fianc\u00e9 Orlando Bloom, singer Katy Perry is a magnificent role model for young mums everywhere.\u00a0She\u2019s not the size zero she once was, but her glorious, curvaceous new-mum body is testimony to the fact she\u2019s the woman she wants to be.         \u00a0 Some of us belonging to the dwindling Anglican community despaired on hearing Meghan\u2019s claim that the Archbishop of Canterbury held a \u2018private\u2019 wedding ceremony for her and Harry before their \u00a332 million public and mostly taxpayer-funded nuptials.As a bog standard churchgoer, I was told that under no circumstances could I ever be \u2018married\u2019 in my church as I was a divorcee.\u00a0As Meghan was. Crikey, I can\u2019t get married again in church, while Megs says she got two in the same week.\u00a0That\u2019s got to be the ultimate Bogof \u2014 buy one, get one free.\u00a0 Adele, worth \u00a3150 million, has quietly finalised her divorce from former charity boss Simon Konecki.\u00a0There\u2019s been no bickering over spousal support, which he could have demanded, and they\u2019ve sorted things out privately through mediation, quietly dividing their assets with the priority of raising together and protecting their eight-year-old son Angelo.Despite all the sadness of the break-up, one suspects that \u2014 just as she sang in her hit Someone Like You \u2014 she wishes \u2018nothing but the best\u2019 for Simon.\u00a0 Westminster warsThe only explanation for Boris\u2019s derisory initial offer of a 1 per cent pay increase for NHS staff is that, having been hospitalised with Covid, he is now suffering the long-term effects, which include \u2018cognitive impairment\u2019 or \u2018brain fog\u2019.\u00a0How else could he justify spending billions on an unworkable Test and Trace system, while our frontline NHS workers go through the hell of the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0 Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg says the estimated \u00a320 billion refurbishment of Parliament is \u2018for the birds\u2019 and that we cannot turn Westminster into Disneyland. Surely we\u2019re already there, Boris and his fianc\u00e9e Carrie as the bickering Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Keir Starmer as Goofy (with a net poll rating of zero) and with tough times and cuts ahead, Chancellor Rishi Sunak morphing into Scrooge.\u00a0 A rare moment of quiet contemplation as Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips read out the names of the 118 women killed by men in the past year, following the disappearance of Sarah Everard who set off across Clapham Common in South London to walk home but never made it. Yet amid such sadness, as Phillips argued, this is not a time to cast men as villains. We need to work together to keep women safe, as well as the many more men who are murdered on our streets.\u00a0 Unfair to octopusesHedge fund boss Crispin Odey, worth \u00a3825 million, is cleared of assaulting a younger colleague who dubbed him the \u2018octopus\u2019 saying he had wandering hands.He confessed he tried to lure her into bed having invited her to his marital home. And he conceded after his acquittal of sexual assault that his amorous behaviour had caused \u2018enormous strain\u2019 on his marriage to his wife Nichola, who was pregnant with their third child at the time.We must applaud the fact an innocent man walked free.\u00a0But amid all this mayhem, perhaps Mr Odey would do well to reflect on the life cycle of male octopuses: they mate with only one female before they die.",

        "full article": "Kenneth C. Kelly, a Black electronics engineer whose antenna designs contributed to the race to the moon, made satellite TV and radio possible and helped NASA communicate with Mars rovers and search for extraterrestrials, has died. The 92-year-old also worked to erase race barriers in the Navy, in California housing and on the newspaper comics pages. Kelly had Parkinson's disease before his death on Feb. 27, his son Ron Kelly said. Kelly was awarded more than a dozen patents for innovations in radar and antenna technology, work that appears in peer-reviewed journals from 1955-1999. His early work at Hughes Aircraft helped create guided missile systems and the ground satellites that tracked the Apollo space missions, he said in an oral history recorded by his family. His two-way antenna designs at Rantec Microwave Systems enabled consumers to have DirecTV and Sirius XM connections, and are featured in the massive Mojave Desert radiotelescopes that search for signs of life in space, his son and JPL colleagues said. After many years working on deep space missions through NASA subcontractors, Kelly worked directly for JPL from 1999 until retiring in 2002, helping to design robotic antennas for the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, according to Joseph Vacchione, who manages the JPL's antenna test range. Kelly appeared in an Associated Press article in 1962 after he moved his family into Gardena, a middle-class suburb that had excluded Black people. To overcome a racist covenant and the repeated refusals of real estate agents, he had to ask a white colleague at Hughes to make the purchase on his behalf.

Kelly had Parkinson's disease before his death on Feb. 27, 2021 his son Ron Kelly said. (Ron Kelly via AP)  \"We have pretty much the same hopes, fears, ambitions, strengths and frailties that have typified all of human existence,\" Kelly wrote in a letter his white neighbors, urging them to set aside \"stereotyped notions,\" according to the AP story. Kelly and his wife Loretta later moved near California State University-Northridge, to be closer to his job and have their children attend better schools. According to the 2017 oral history, the agent wouldn\u00b4t sell him the lot, so he had to repeat the demeaning experience of having white friends buy it for him before signing over the mortgage. Kelly became president of the San Fernando Valley Fair Housing Council, testing listings to prove discrimination, lobbying authorities and going to court to prevent whites-only advertising. To do more from the inside, he became a leading Realtor, helping many Black families move into new suburbs in the 1970s. Kelly had another role in promoting racial harmony after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. A white ally of the Kellys on the Fair Housing Council, schoolteacher Harriet Glickman, had been corresponding with cartoonist Charles Schulz, urging him to add a Black character to his comic strip. At the time, Black people were all but invisible in mass media. Letters published by the Charles M. Schulz Museum show the cartoonist was reluctant, fearing the move would seem patronizing to Black people in the wake of King's death. Glickman recruited Kelly to persuade Schulz otherwise. Kelly urged the cartoonist to treat the Black character as a \"supernumerary\" - just another member of the Peanuts gang. Franklin soon appeared on a beach, helping Charlie Brown build a sand castle. Born in 1928 in New York City and raised by a single mother who worked as a live-in maid, Kelly began living at 13 in the Harlem YMCA, where he was mentored by older black men including photographer Gordon Parks. He tested into Brooklyn Tech high school, then enlisted in the Navy to be trained as an electronics technician. Told he could only be a steward to white officers, he wrote to the chief recruiter and was allowed to take the engineering exam just when President Harry Truman was moving to desegregate the military. \"I think I\u00b4m a crazy optimist,\" Kelly said in his oral history. \"I\u00b4m definitely the half-full glass person. I meet lots of people who are so pessimistic. I always thought I could.\" Kelly's Navy training helped him excel at Brooklyn Polytechnic College and get a job at Hughes Aircraft in 1953. He later learned that his white colleagues had been polled to see if they'd work with a Black man; the few who said they\u00b4d quit were told to do so. Kelly and Loretta were members of the Ethical Cultural Society for decades. He also formed a society of Black scientists and engineers who launched science fairs and outreach programs to minority students in Los Angeles, which was booming with Black people fleeing the South in the post-war period. \"I think the more contact between the ones who have been successful in what they\u00b4re doing and the ones who are several steps down the line, the better,\" he said. Kelly felt racism's sting repeatedly in life, but was determined to overcome it. \"We have a terrible real history of defeat, horrible conditions, death, rapes, just a hell of a history of Blacks in this country, but I don\u00b4t think knowing it is that valuable unless it encourages you do more to beat it somehow, and I think we can,\" Kelly said in his oral history. Kelly was predeceased by his first wife, Gloria White, and his son David. He is survived by his ex-wife Loretta Kelly, his third wife Anne Kelly, his son Ron Kelly, his stepson Steve Kelly, their wives and two grandchildren.

Cinemas in Los Angeles County, the home of Hollywood and the largest moviegoing market in the United States, have been closed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Local authorities cleared them to resume operations again starting on Monday if they limited attendance to 25% capacity. AMC said it would return to business starting with theaters in Burbank and Century City. The company plans to begin opening the rest of its theaters in the Los Angeles area, and elsewhere in California, starting on March 19. Los Angeles is the largest market for AMC by number of theaters. The company has 56 theaters in California including 25 in Los Angeles County. Movie theater chains and independent cinemas were devastated by the extended closures and are hoping that audiences will return in the spring and summer as coronavirus vaccines become more widely distributed.

        "title": "More than 1,000 Guard troops now leaving DC; others stay on",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - More than 1,000 National Guard members will be leaving Washington, D.C. over the next few days, but several thousand others will stay on for days or weeks, in the ongoing mission to provide security for the U.S. Capitol that has drawn criticism from lawmakers and reluctance from the military. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier this week approved the Capitol Police request to extend the deployment of nearly 2,300 Guard members for about two more months because possible threats of violence remain. According to the National Guard, troops from some states will stay in Washington for the entire two months. Others will return home but will be replaced by service members from the same state. But some states, such as Michigan, will no longer participate in the mission. The Capitol Police request for an extension triggered a lengthy debate in the Pentagon, as Army and Guard officials questioned the need, and wanted to know if all other options had been exhausted. Military leaders were also concerned because governors initially expressed reluctance to have their troops stay in the city. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made it clear that she did \"not have any intention of agreeing to an extension of this deployment.\" Some of the roughly 1,000 Michigan troops that have been in Washington have gone home, and others are leaving this weekend. Darla Torres, spokeswoman for the National Guard Bureau, said that 11 states have agreed to provide troops for the two-month mission, including three - New Jersey, Washington and Wisconsin - that don't currently have Guard forces in the city. The other eight - Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri and Ohio - have forces already on Capitol Hill and have agreed to continue. Troops from the District of Columbia Guard will continue in the security mission.          National Guard stand their posts around the Capitol at sunrise in Washington, Monday, March 8, 2021. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  As of Friday there were about 4,300 Guard troops in the city. Military officials are scrambling to juggle the logistical challenge of getting several thousand home over the next two weeks, while others flow in. The continued deployment drew some criticism from Capitol Hill, where lawmakers expressed frustration at tall black fencing around the building and the troops on the streets, comparing it all to a walled city. But it also underscores concerns about security at the Capitol, two months after rioters breached the building in an attack that left five people dead. Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, the ranking Republican, said that while some level of support from the Guard is needed, they expressed concerns about the deployment's long-term effects. \"We cannot ignore the financial costs associated with this prolonged deployment, nor can we turn a blind eye to the effects it will soon have on the National Guard\u00b4s overall readiness,\" they said in a statement. \"It\u00b4s time for us to review what level of security is required, so they can return home to their families and communities.\" Many states have been using National Guard to help with COVID-19 vaccinations and other coronavirus missions. The National Guard Association of the United States also questioned the extension, noting that it was difficult for Guard leaders to find enough volunteers for the mission. \"National Guard soldiers and airmen here in Washington need to return home to their families, civilian employers and regular military obligations,\" said Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire, the NGAUS chairman, and retired Brig. Gen. J. Roy Robinson, the NGAUS president. \"They have completed their mission. They have made us all proud. It\u00b4s time for local law enforcement to take it from here.\"",

        "full article": "LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - The Premier League plans to welcome up to 10,000 fans in stadiums for the final two rounds of matches this season, chief executive Richard Masters said on Friday. The British government last month set out a four-stage easing of England's COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Under the third stage of the \"roadmap\", very large outdoor stadiums will - if all conditions are met - from May 17 be able to have up to 10,000 people or 25% capacity, whichever is lower. \"Hopefully the final two fixtures of our season will have up to 10,000 supporters in them all,\" Masters said in a statement posted on the league's official website https://www.premierleague.com/news/2063954. \"We've got to go past those first initial steps in the government's roadmap to get there, so hopefully that will be a fantastic finale to end the season.\" The current fixture schedule has May 15 and 23 listed as the final two weekends of the Premier League season. Masters said the suspension of the 2019-20 season and the absence of fans amid the COVID-19 crisis came at a heavy cost. Stadiums in some parts of England briefly opened up to a limited number of fans in December but the government imposed another lockdown after a new wave of COVID-19 infections. \"Towards the end of this season we'll get towards 2 billion pounds ($2.78 billion) lost since the start of the pandemic in matchday and broadcast revenue,\" said Masters. \"Clubs have continued to invest in competitive match-day squads and the Premier League has continued to make good all of its contributions throughout the pyramid and wider football. \"But the ramifications are that ultimately if there's less money coming into football, then there'll be less money going out in the short term.\" Should the vaccination programme in the UK go according to plan, Masters is optimistic football in Britain could be back to normal next season. \"From the beginning of next season, our goal is to have full stadia and the Government\u00b4s roadmap offers us that opportunity,\" he explained.

        "title": "Hawaii town blocked by landslide launches makeshift ferry",
        "full article": "HONOLULU (AP) - Volunteers on Kauai\u00b4s north shore in Hawaii have launched a makeshift ferry service across a river after a landslide along a two-lane highway cut several towns off from the rest of the island. The boats are taking people across the river to jobs, get medical care and helping deliver taro, the region\u00b4s major crop. Officials hope to reopen at least one lane of the highway for emergency purposes next Tuesday, but the outlook is uncertain. Multiple landslides three years ago cut off a similar section of the north shore for 14 months. This year, one big landslide hit further down the road, blocking off an even bigger portion of Kauai. Altogether, residents estimate about 1,000 people live in the towns now isolated, including Hanalei, Haena and Wainiha. Three years ago, Hanalei was hit with flooding but the landslides struck on the other side of the town so it maintained its road link that time. The ferry service runs from a public beach park on in Hanalei to private property about 200 feet or \"a short hop\" across the Hanalei River. Donations are paying for the vessel fuel, and the boats are taking people over as the demand rises. \"The really amazing thing is that we have a very resilient community, and they came in and put in place their plan to address this need.,\" said Rep. Nadine Nakamura, who represents the area in the state House.          A mudslide leaves Kamehameha Highway coated near Pokole Point on Tuesday, March 9, 2021, near Kahaluu, Hawaii. The entire state was under a flash flood watch amid heavy rains expected to last through Wednesday morning. (Craig T. Kojima/Honolulu Star-Advertiser via AP)  The smaller boats can take up to about four to five people at a time. The larger boats are delivering taro, a starchy root vegetable that is a staple of the traditional Hawaiian diet. Hanalei and the surrounding areas grow 85% of the state\u00b4s taro crop. Nakamura said the area's taro growers need to be able to ship 30,000 pounds of taro a week. Some also need to send poi - a purple glutinous dish made from taro - to markets throughout Hawaii. Coming the other direction, the boats have brought workers to open Hanalei's grocery store and bring eggs, bread and other food. Hermina Morita, a community leader who was helping gather information about people's needs, said the landslide compounds challenges for businesses in the area. \"With the April 2018 flood and COVID on top of it and then, now, the businesses out here are really hurting,\" she said. Tourism is down dramatically across Hawaii because of the coronavirus pandemic, but especially on Kauai, which for many months has imposed tighter restrictions on travel than the rest of the state. Still, Morita said many food trucks have been generously serving what food they have. \"They\u00b4re feeding volunteers in the communities while taking an extremely hard financial hit,\" Morita said. Jim Moffat, who owns two restaurants in Hanalei, said the area needs a secondary route in and out. He noted that when there's a tsunami warning and people need to evacuate, there's no way to get to higher ground when the road is blocked. \"This is silly that in this day and age that there\u00b4s no second route out of that community and that we\u00b4re piling tons of money into restabilizing a mountainside,\" Moffatt said. Moffatt's two restaurants - a Spanish tapas place called Bar Acuda and a ramen restaurant called Ama - have been operating at 20 percent to 30 percent capacity four days a week from Wednesday through Saturday because of the pandemic. Moffatt had been anticipating opening further next month when Kauai allows travelers with a negative COVID-19 test to enter without quarantine. He said he will what the situation looks like next week and decide what to do based on what the community needs. \"But we\u00b4re in no rush to do anything. We\u00b4re all set and fine. The restaurant's quiet and everything\u00b4s good down there,\" he said.          A house on Haleiwa Road is surrounded by floodwaters Tuesday, March 9, 2021, in Haleiwa, Hawaii.

        "full article": "MEXICO CITY (AP) - Gunmen opened fire on a patrol of four state police officers in the north-central Mexican state of Zacatecas, then poured gasoline on their patrol vehicle and burned the officers. The state police department said late Thursday that other police patrols pursued the attackers, killing two and arresting seven of them. They found the dead officers\u00b4 bulletproof vests and ammunition magazines in the suspects\u00b4 possession. Hours later on Friday, police uncovered a drug cartel camp nearby where two kidnap victims had been held in captivity since January. No arrests were made at the camp. The department did not say which gang the attackers belonged to, but remnants of the old Zetas cartel have been active there. The largely agricultural state of Zacatecas has increasingly become the focus of turf battles between rival cartels, including the Zetas remnants, the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels, and the rival Jalisco New Generation cartel. The state saw murders rise from just 44 in January 2020, to 161 in January 2021. The two dominant cartels, Sinaloa and Jalisco, have been fighting it out in other states in Mexico, and both have now reportedly moved their battle into Zacatecas, allying themselves with local groups.",

        "full article": "WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The daughter of the boss of one of Mexico's most powerful drug gangs has pleaded guilty to carrying out financial dealings with Mexican firms identified as narcotics traffickers, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday. Court documents showed Jessica Johanna Oseguera Gonzalez made property transactions for six businesses providing material support to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) run by her father Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera, the department said in a press release. In so doing, the 34-year-old dual U.S.-Mexican citizen violated criminal penalties of the foreign narcotics kingpin designation act, known as the Kingpin Act, the department said. Her guilty plea came about thanks to the United States' commitment to disrupt and dismantle all aspects of the CJNG, the press release cited special agent in charge Bill Bodner of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Los Angeles field division as saying. U.S. officials have described Oseguera, who was arrested in February 2020, as the gang's main money launderer. She is scheduled to be sentenced on June 11 and faces a maximum penalty of up to 30 years in prison. Oseguera is also a niece of Abigael Gonzalez Valencia, boss of Los Cuinis, an outfit allied to the CJNG. He was arrested in 2015 and has been fighting extradition to the United States. Her father, a former policeman, remains at large. \"El Mencho\" is one of the most wanted men in Mexico and has a $10-million U.S. bounty on his head.

        "title": "'Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal' Review: Chris Smith's Highly Engrossing Netflix Doc Nails It All",
        "full article": "By Owen Gleiberman LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - In criminal cases, wiretapped phone conversations are commanding pieces of evidence (juries love them), and in documentaries about crime they tend to be some of the most gripping. We hear people as they really are. In \"Allen v. Farrow,\" the tapes of Woody Allen in phone conversations secretly recorded by Mia Farrow present an oily power side of him that has never been heard as openly. And in the bracing documentary \"Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal,\" we hear the high drama of wealthy parents on the phone with Rick Singer, the independent college counselor who orchestrated the massive scam that rocked the world of elite college admissions. It sent Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin to jail -- but that scurrilous saga of fallen celebrity was, in this case, just the tabloid tip of the iceberg. The movie was directed by Chris Smith, who has made documentaries about a wide range of subjects, from Jim Carrey (\"Jim and Andy: The Great Beyond\") to the specter of global financial meltdown (\"Collapse\") to the implosion of an infamous luxury music festival (\"Fyre\"). He has virtually never directed a conventional, just-the-facts-ma'am documentary, and though \"Operation Varsity Blues\" has all the facts, and lays them out with galvanizing clarity and precision, the innovative move Smith makes is to take FBI transcripts of wiretapped conversations and play them out, in real settings, with actors portraying the relevant people. Matthew Modine, with ruddy skin and a helmet of thatchy gray hair cut into a monk's severe bangs, plays Singer, the methodical, hatchet-faced manipulator at the center of the scandal. About three-fifths of the movie is a straightforward documentary, with talking-head witnesses who knew Singer from his hometown of Sacramento, and we get a sense of the kind of man he was: dour, furtive, workaholic, with a sodden earnest surface that made him seem the furthest possible thing from a con artist. He looks like a joyless Richard Belzer, but at the time even that look was part of his mystique. A former client recalls, \"He always dressed like he had just come from the basketball court. His idea was that what he was doing was coaching kids for getting into college, so therefore he dressed like a coach.\" In the staged sections with Modine, it feels, at first, like we're watching a TV-movie. The difference is: Everything out of Singer's mouth is stuff he actually said, word for word. And so we get a close-up view of how the events unfolded, and of how the wealthy parents who were drawn into Singer's web contributed, knowingly, to the spinning of the web. They were co-conspirators in a hugely successful racket: the bribing of college athletic coaches and university administrators, all to guarantee admission. As Singer saw it, there were three ways to get into a college like Stanford or Yale or Georgetown: through the \"front door,\" which means that you make it on your own merits; through the \"back door,\" which means that your parents make a donation of such magnitude (meaning tens of millions) that the college rolls out the red carpet; and the option that became the Singer specialty -- the \"side door,\" which was based on parents ponying up sums in the range of $500,000 to $1 million (they would donate the money to Singer's Key Worldwide Foundation, so that it could be laundered as a charitable contribution), which then got passed on as bribes to sources within the college. But the money wasn't enough. Singer figured out how to pass off the student applicants as athletes, usually in classy niche sports like Crew, fencing, and horseback riding, because those sports were more under the radar. He would photoshop images of them playing water polo (or, in the case of Lori Loughlin's two daughters, take photographs of them on rowing machines), all to suggest to the admissions board that the students were athletes the colleges should covet. When they arrived at the school, the fact that they never spent one minute on those teams would just get buried. Singer also paid off proctors to fake the results of SAT tests. Part of the scam there, intriguingly, was the lengths to which he had to go to conceal the deception from the students who were taking the tests. In almost every case, the parents weren't just bribing the colleges -- they were scamming their own kids. The nuts and bolts of how Singer's operation worked are clever and shameless, and the movie explains it all fairly quickly. The complicity of the parents, who in the re-enacted phone conversations are often visibly anxious about whether they're going to be found out (they have no idea their heads are on the chopping block as they speak), is the case's juiciest true-crime element. Yet what makes \"Operation Varsity Blues\" a movie of great value, one that does more than just color in the story behind the headlines, is that it presents a searing and searching indictment of the commodification of college: the way our elite institutions of higher learning are now selling prestige to an increasingly hermetic club of vulgarly powerful American aristocrats. There are 3,000 colleges in the United States, and many of them are good, but the reason that more and more people are desperate to get into those 25 or 50 top-tier schools is because of their feeling that the system -- the whole culture -- is rigged. To gain access to an elite college is to purchase an aura, one that in theory never stops giving dividends. It's become aspirational in the way certain reality TV show are. And the fact that so many feel they need that aura, or life will shut them out, is a sign that the society has been increasingly designed to squash all but a select few. As \"Operation Varsity Blues\" presents it, that's the larger scam.",

        "title": "Mexico spurns endangered porpoise, may seek to blame US",
        "full article": "MEXICO CITY (AP) - A Mexican government body met Friday to consider several proposals that would almost certainly harm the vaquita marina porpoise, the world\u00b4s most endangered marine mammal, and try to blame the porpoise's plight on the United States. The inter-agency group is considering lifting endangered-species protection on the totoaba, a fish whose capture often results in by-catch of vaquitas, as few as 10 of which remain. The Environment Department said the group\u00b4s recommendations won\u00b4t be made public until March 26. It had no immediate comment on the proposals. Opening up legal fishing of totoaba - whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and is worth thousands of dollars - would probably increase the deaths of vaquitas. But such a move would provide a windfall for some fishermen in Mexico. \"This agenda is focused on maintaining the status quo and abandoning the vaquita marina and returning to fishing for totoaba,\" said Alex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity. \"It is disappointing that this administration has ruined everything that had been done\" in a decade-long fight to save the tiny, elusive porpoise. The meeting, which was closed to the public, is also considering reducing the protection area for the vaquita marina in the upper Gulf of California, the only place the vaquita lives. That would open up more areas to gill nets used for totoaba and other species that trap and drown vaquitas. The group also revived an old, discredited theory that blames the vaquitas\u00b4 decline on the lack of water flows from the U.S. through the Colorado River, which starts in the United States and empties into the Gulf, also known as the Sea of Cortez.          FILE - In this Feb. 17, 2018 file photo, an activist carries a vaquita porpoise skull on a conch as activists and artists during a procession for the critically endangered vaquita porpoise in Mexico City. The Mexican government said Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021, it is considering reducing the protection area for the vaquita marina in the upper Gulf of California, an apparent admission that the tiny porpoise may never return to the entire historic range of its habitat. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File)  \"It appears we are returning to the past with the discussion of the Colorado River ... as a cause of the die-off of the vaquita marina,\" said Olivera. The Colorado River theory posited that a decline of fresh water from the river due to U.S. usage had increased salinity in the upper Gulf, somehow affecting the vaquita. A scientist who is familiar with issue, but who could speak on the record for fear of antagonizing the Mexican government, called the renewed use of the theory a nationalistic ploy that had no basis in science. \"The only people who believe in this are politicians\" in Mexico who \"seek to cast the blame on the United States, on anything except fishing,\" said the scientist. Olivera said \"the theory has been completely discredited. The scientific evidence is conclusive, that fishing nets are the main cause of the deaths of vaquitas.\" Mexico\u00b4s Environment Department previously said the drop in the number of vaquitas and the area where they have been seen in recent years justifies reducing the protection zone, which currently covers most of the upper Gulf. The zone starts around the Colorado river delta and extends south past the fishing town of San Felipe and near Puerto Pe\u00f1asco. But such a move is also an admission the tiny porpoise may never return to the entire historic range of its habitat.",

        "title": "Children packed into Border Patrol tent for days on end",
        "full article": "HOUSTON (AP) - Hundreds of immigrant children and teenagers have been detained at a Border Patrol tent facility in packed conditions, with some sleeping on the floor because there aren't enough mats, according to nonprofit lawyers who conduct oversight of immigrant detention centers. The lawyers interviewed more than a dozen children Thursday in Donna, Texas, where the Border Patrol is holding more than 1,000 people. Some of the youths told the lawyers they had been at the facility for a week or longer, despite the agency's three-day limit for detaining children. Many said they haven't been allowed to phone their parents or other relatives who may be wondering where they are. Despite concerns about the coronavirus, the children are kept so closely together that they can touch the person next to them, the lawyers said. Some have to wait five days or more to shower, and there isn't always soap available, just shampoo, according to the lawyers. President Joe Biden's administration denied the lawyers access to the tent facility. During the administration of former President Donald Trump, attorney visits to Border Patrol stations revealed severe problems, including dozens of children held at one rural station without adequate food, water, or soap. \"It is pretty surprising that the administration talks about the importance of transparency and then won\u00b4t let the attorneys for children set eyes on where they\u00b4re staying,\" said Leecia Welch of the National Center for Youth Law, one of the lawyers. \"I find that very disappointing.\" Although none of the children reported situations as severe as during the Trump era, Welch said the lawyers \"weren\u00b4t able to lay eyes on any of it to see for ourselves, so we\u00b4re just piecing together what they said.\"          FILE - In this Thursday, May 2, 2019 file photo, Border Patrol agents hold a news conference prior to a media tour of a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection temporary facility near the Donna International Bridge in Donna, Texas. President Joe Biden's administration is refusing to allow lawyers who inspect facilities where immigrant children are detained to enter a Border Patrol tent in Texas where agents are holding hundreds of youths. The attorneys say they were allowed to speak to children at the facility in Donna on Thursday, March 11, 2021 but were denied the chance to see the areas where the youths were being held. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)  A 1997 court settlement known as the Flores agreement sets standards for government detention of immigrant children. Lawyers are entitled under Flores to conduct oversight of child detention. The Justice Department declined to comment Thursday on why the lawyers were denied access. The Biden administration has not responded to several requests from The Associated Press seeking access to the tent. Government figures show a growing crisis as hundreds of children cross the border daily and are taken into custody. The Border Patrol currently has a record high of more than 3,000 children in detention, according to government data obtained by AP. That figure is rising almost daily. More children are waiting longer in Border Patrol custody because long-term facilities operated by U.S. Health and Human Services have next to no capacity. Hundreds of children are being apprehended daily at far higher rates than HHS is releasing them to parents or sponsors. HHS currently takes an average of 37 days to release a child. Biden has stopped the Trump-era practice of expelling immigrant children who cross the border alone, but maintained expulsions of immigrant families and single adults. While his administration has tried to deter immigrants from entering the U.S., many believe they have a better chance now. There have also been growing reports of parents sending their children across the border alone while they remain in Mexico or Central America. Most Border Patrol stations were designed for short-term detention of adults, with cold, concrete cells with the lights always on. The Donna tent has clear partitions and mats for sleeping, according to images the government has released. Six children died after being detained by border agents during the Trump administration. One died of the flu at the Border Patrol station in Weslaco, Texas, where minors are currently being held. HHS has told its contractors to lift capacity restrictions enacted during the pandemic and expedite releases by paying for children\u00b4s airfare instead of charging sponsors. But experts and lawyers who work with children say the government can do more. While the majority of youths detained by the government are teenagers, both Border Patrol and HHS are detaining very young children who were in some cases separated from adult caretakers. The Associated Press this week interviewed the mother of one 4-year-old girl from Guatemala who crossed the border March 5 with her aunt. Border authorities expelled the aunt and labeled the girl unaccompanied by a parent, placing her in the Donna tent. The girl\u00b4s parents live in Maryland. Her mother told the AP that she didn\u00b4t know their daughter\u00b4s whereabouts until Sunday and didn\u00b4t speak to her until Monday. According to the mother, the girl was unable to speak in a nearly 20-minute phone call. The AP is not identifying the girl or her mother to protect the child\u00b4s privacy. \"She cried as if something was going on, as if she was scared,\" the mother said this week. \"I started crying when I heard her that way. It didn\u00b4t seem right to me.\" The parents asked for their daughter to be released to them directly but on Monday she was sent from South Texas to foster care in Michigan. When she spoke to her mother Tuesday morning, the girl was no longer crying but still wasn\u00b4t able to speak. \"She didn\u00b4t say anything,\" she said. \"I tried everything I could, but nothing.\" Both Homeland Security and HHS initially said they could not directly release the child to her mother. But after the family's lawyers threatened to sue and following inquiries from AP, the government notified the girl\u00b4s mother Wednesday that they would expedite her release. Amy Maldonado, a lawyer for the family, noted that the government\u00b4s often cumbersome processes and the inadequate spaces to hold children at the border predate the Biden administration. \"I don\u00b4t hold them accountable for the full history,\" she said. \"But this kid could have been released to her mom, and that is on this administration.\" ___ Associated Press journalist Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "full article": "Confession time. I cannot sing like David Bowie nor write plays like Harold Pinter nor poems like Rudyard Kipling. Yet we do have something in common. We have all said no to the offer of a gong.Actually even that isn't quite true. In my case it was suggested by Alastair Campbell when he was Tony Blair's right-hand man rather than actually offered. But I'd have said no if it had been so it comes down to the same thing in the end.That's partly because the only reason they'd give an honour to someone they regarded as a troublesome hack would be to make him a bit less troublesome.\u00a0It's also because the whole honours system is, to use Whitehall jargon, unfit for purpose.\u00a0Not to mention often downright corrupt and shrouded in secrecy.This week the curtain was lifted a little \u2014 albeit by accident rather than design.The Government has set up online classes for people to 'master' the honours nomination system to help them get awards.\u00a0We know about it because the letter from the Government department was leaked.\u00a0         The honour system is 'downright corrupt' writes JOHN HUMPHRYS, after it was revealed the Government set up online classes for people to 'master' the nomination systemSo was the list of big business bosses who received it.\u00a0 No wonder there is great embarrassment in Whitehall.Let's give you a flavour of the lucky recipients. One was Serco, the private company that has made a fortune helping to run so many of our public services \u2014 including the Test and Trace system, which is costing us an eye-watering \u00a337 billion.The leak happened on the very day that Parliament's Public Accounts Committee delivered a damning indictment of Test and Trace.\u00a0It had contributed nothing to tackling the pandemic. Yet it's still managing to spend a fortune on 2,500 management consultants, some of whom have been paid a whopping \u00a36,000 a day.Not bad considering only a fraction did anything to earn it. Or so says the committee.\u00a0         Serco, the private company that has made a fortune helping to run so many of our public services, including Test and Trace (pictured, a drive-in testing facility) was one of the recipients of the classes They also mentioned the salaries pulled down by the two top bosses: \u00a37.4 million last year, much of it in bonuses. You may ask: for what precisely?Serco was not alone in being invited to learn to apply for gongs. Two of the world's biggest accountancy firms were on the list as well in spite of deeply troubling questions being raised about their own standards.\u00a0So were Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Doubtless a reward for their skills in tax avoidance.These are companies whose sole concerns are share prices and bonuses. Their behaviour is often cited as one of the principle causes of Britain's hopeless record on productivity.Rishi Sunak has already 'honoured' them \u2014 with a Budget promise of huge tax breaks over the next couple of years to get them to invest.

Share this article Share   So why are they being urged to get their bids in for all those tempting gongs? Is it too cynical to suggest that certain civil servants and politicians are looking to their own futures after they leave Whitehall?Put bluntly the honours system embodies much of what is wrong with modern Britain: corruption, abiding snobbery and obsession with status.Just look at the titles themselves. The most modest is the bem, the British Empire Medal. What Empire is that then?The more elevated is Commander of that same British Empire. Then you start getting into knighthoods.This silly Ruritanian distinction between awards is meaningless. All it does is bolster something dear to the heart of British snobbery: hierarchy and a pecking order.Remember that wonderful scene from Yes Minister when Bernard explains to the PM the meaning of knighthoods: 'CMG means 'Call me God'; KCMG means 'Kindly call me God'; GCMG means 'God calls me God'.' Perfect.So should we just dump the lot of them? Actually no.Rather bizarrely, you may think, I would keep the rank of BEM.\u00a0         Lewis Hamilton has become 'Sir Lewis' because he can drive a car very fast. He's made a vast fortune from doing it, which is why he has chosen to live in Monaco where he pays rather less tax than he would in the country that honoured himIts name would have to change but not its purpose. It does what any decent honours system should do and that is reward ordinary people for extraordinary service.It gives them recognition, be they lollipop lady or magistrate or nurse or teacher. They get their name in the local paper and a medal for the mantelpiece to be worn on special occasions. And why not?Recognition is the one justification for an honours system. Why give honours to those who are already widely recognised and well rewarded?Lewis Hamilton has become 'Sir Lewis' because he can drive a car very fast. He's made a vast fortune from doing it, which is why he has chosen to live in Monaco where he pays rather less tax than he would in the country that honoured him.Another sportsman, long retired, is Ian Botham. He now has a seat in the House of Lords and nobody seems quite sure why. A peerage is, after all, the cherry on top of the honours cake.It gives the new lord or lady a role for life in helping determine the laws that govern all our lives without the great inconvenience of having to persuade us to vote for them. And Prime Ministers have been scattering peerages around like confetti in recent years.There's not always a sordid financial calculation involved, although it does no harm if you can afford to bung the odd million into party coffers. But Prime Ministers have different motives for creating so many new peers. One is that it helps keep truculent MPs in line.'Are you quite sure you can't bring yourself to support the PM?' says the smiling chief whip to the rebellious old lag who knows his chances of getting into the Government have long passed and who always thought his leader was a bit of a twerp anyway.'Pity really . . . you'd have looked good in ermine. Plenty of companies out there who like having the odd lord on their board, too . . . 'The old Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe liked to say that the House of Lords was proof that there really is life after death.\u00a0Maybe, but it's right and proper that we should benefit from the wisdom and experience of people such as David Blunkett and Ken Clarke.\u00a0They have no political ambitions left but still want to be of public service. And they have more than earned their elevation to the upper house.         If we kick an MP out of his job at the General Election we don't approve when the Prime Minister promptly gives him a peerage so he can carry on being a minister. That's what Boris Johnson did with Zac Goldsmith. It's showing two fingers to the electorateBut it is absurdly bloated. More than 800 members. The second largest legislature in the world. Beaten only by the Chinese National People's Congress.The question is what kind of upper house we want it to be. We know what we don't want.If we kick an MP out of his job at the General Election we don't approve when the Prime Minister promptly gives him a peerage so he can carry on being a minister.\u00a0That's what Boris Johnson did with Zac Goldsmith. It's showing two fingers to the electorate.The real honours story is not who gets them but who hands them out. It has become primarily a device for politicians to court popularity, raise money and get their way. At its worst it is rotten to the core and has been for years.Lloyd George had a price list: \u00a3400,000 (in today's money) for a knighthood, four times as much for a peerage. Parliament eventually passed an Act to stop it, but it didn't work. It just became a bit more subtle.\u00a0There has scarcely been a Prime Minister in recent history who hasn't been embroiled in an honours scandal.So here's a suggestion. Let's pass a law that says making a party donation above a modest amount automatically disqualifies you from accepting a peerage from that party.\u00a0Perhaps a BEM might be allowed \u2014 but I don't suppose the rich donors would be very impressed by that, would they?Better, surely, that the present system should be abandoned and restructured to recognise those who genuinely deserve recognition, can get it no other way and wouldn't dream of greasing political palms even if they could afford it.Perhaps that will be a topic for those who sign up to the online classes. But probably not.",

        "full article": "San Jose Sharks general manager Doug Wilson characterized his team as being in the middle of a \"reset,\" where taking a step back may be necessary before the franchise can get back into contention after years near the top of the standings. After finishing last in the Western Conference last season when they missed the playoffs for just the second time since Wilson became general manager in 2003, the Sharks are struggling once again in this pandemic-altered season. They came into Friday with the fewest points in the West Division and are in danger of missing the playoffs in consecutive seasons for just the third time in franchise history. \"Are we within the window to win a Stanley Cup this year? That\u00b4s highly unlikely,\" Wilson said Friday. \"Are we going to compete to try and make the playoffs? Yes, we are. Are we going to commit to the reset in the younger players getting opportunities? Yes, we are.\" Wilson said the process began last season when he acquired extra picks at the trade deadline, giving him nine in last year\u00b4s draft, and is ongoing as the franchise tries to develop young players to complement Logan Couture, Erik Karlsson, Brent Burns, Evander Kane, Timo Meier and other veterans. Wilson said he\u00b4s been pleased with some of the progress he\u00b4s seen and is hopeful of a relatively quick turnaround for a franchise that made it to the Western Conference Final as recently as 2019.

Wilson characterized his team as being in the middle of a \"reset\" where taking a step back may be necessary before the franchise can get back into contention after years near the top of the standings. (AP Photo/Josie Lepe, File)  But key players like Joe Pavelski and Joe Thornton are gone from that team and the Sharks are trying to develop a new core to build around. \"We don\u00b4t put a timeline on it,\" Wilson said. \"But we think that there\u00b4s no reason why we can\u00b4t be back in a very good position by next season.\" It\u00b4s been a difficult season so far for the Sharks, who were one of the seven teams that didn\u00b4t qualify for the bubble last year and went 10 months without playing a game. Then when they returned for this season they had to relocate for training camp in Arizona because of coronavirus restrictions in Santa Clara County. The Sharks then played the first 12 and 14 of their first 16 games on the road before finally getting an extended homestand. They went just 2-4-1 on that homestand but had to play six of those games without forward Tomas Hertl, who had the coronavirus, and also missed injured forward Timo Meier for the final two games. Wilson said he was encouraged by wins over Colorado and St. Louis and an overtime loss to Vegas on the homestand. \"There\u00b4s been some good moments,\" he said. \"There\u00b4s been some moments where we didn\u00b4t like what we saw. But I think as we\u00b4re trying to get this team in a place where guys can reestablish their games and some young guys integrated in and play a style of play that fits going forward. There\u00b4s been bumps, but there\u00b4s been some moments. I\u00b4m actually happy to be here at this point now and I\u00b4m looking forward to the rest of the season where hopefully we have continuity and some rhythm.\" One issue the Sharks must resolve is the goaltending. Martin Jones and Devan Dubnyk have struggled and rank toward the bottom in save percentage, with Jones\u00b4 mark of .879 ranking 48th of 49 qualifiers and Dubnyk at 41st (.893). Jones has had a save percentage below .900 the past three regular seasons and the Sharks hoped the acquisition of Dubnyk would help solve those woes. \"I think they\u00b4ll be the first to tell you it\u00b4s been inconsistent. It\u00b4s not been where we need it to get to,\" Wilson said. \"The goaltenders have to get to the next level. They do.

But he reported to the Red Sox complex in Fort Myers, Florida, with a sore shoulder, which manager Alex Cora attributed to Bogaerts pushing himself too hard at home in Aruba during the offseason. He was in the lineup at designated hitter on Friday because he hasn\u00b4t been cleared to play the field yet. \"Everything felt good. I\u00b4m looking forward to getting in there more often,\" he said. \"It\u00b4s all about me getting in the routine with baseball activities.

Cora said that hadn't been decided yet. \"Obviously, Xander has some ideas; we probably have some others,\" Cora said. \"The goal is for him to be ready for opening day. On that one, we are probably on the same page.\" Also Friday, right-handed reliever Hirokazu Sawamura made his spring training debut. He got two quick outs on a fly ball and a strikeout, then got into trouble with a double and three straight walks. \"I was nervous, but in a good way,\" he said. \"I think I was tying to do too much on the mound. Sawamura, 32, spent 10 seasons in the Japanese league before signing with the Red Sox this winter.

        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - The Biden administration is not planning to step up government surveillance of the U.S. internet even as state-backed foreign hackers and cybercriminals increasingly use it to evade detection, a senior administration official said Friday. The official said the administration, mindful of the privacy and civil liberties implications that could arise, is not currently seeking additional authority to monitor U.S.-based networks. Instead, the administration will focus on tighter partnerships and improved information-sharing with the private-sector companies that already have broad visibility into the domestic internet, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. The comment was an acknowledgement of the fraught political debate surrounding domestic government surveillance - nearly eight years after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden triggered a scandal with leaked agency documents - and a recognition of the challenges in balancing the growing cyber defense imperative against privacy concerns that come with stepped-up monitoring. Foreign state hackers are increasingly using U.S.-based virtual private networks, or VPNs, to evade detection by U.S. intelligence agencies, who are legally constrained from monitoring domestic infrastructure. In the crucial second stage of the SolarWinds hacking campaign, for instance, the suspected Russian intelligence operatives used U.S.-based VPNs to siphon off data through backdoors in victims\u00b4 networks, establishing an account that made it seem like they were in the U.S. That hack detected in December compromised at least nine federal agencies, and exposed \"significant gaps in modernization and in technology of cybersecurity across the federal government,\" the official said. Dozens of private-sector companies were also hit, the telecommunications and software sector most heavily.          FILE - In this Oct. 8, 2019, file photo a woman works at a computer in New York. The Biden administration is not planning to step up government surveillance of the U.S. internet even as state-backed foreign hackers and cybercriminals increasingly use it to evade detection, a senior administration official said Friday. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)  The U.S. is also addressing a separate, far more widespread and indiscriminate hack that cyber sleuths blame on China and which became a global crisis last week. It has exposed tens of thousands of servers running Microsoft\u00b4s Exchange email program to intrusion. Though Microsoft has patched the vulnerability, affected server owners had only a \"short window\" to get vulnerable servers fixed, the official said. Criminal and state-backed hackers seeking to exploit the underlying flaw are apt to cause more havoc, the administration says. The official said President Joe Biden has been briefed on the incident, and private-sector cybersecurity sleuths were brought in to confer with White House officials on a response. When it comes to the pursuit of new surveillance or monitoring authorities, the official described the administration\u00b4s posture as \"not yet, not now.\" The official said the administration is committed at the moment to improving the flow of information with cloud providers and private companies who have good visibility into U.S. networks but aren't bound by the same government constraints. Predictions from the cybersecurity community were proving correct, meanwhile, that ransomware attacks leveraging compromised Exchange servers would be inevitable given the scope of the hack. Microsoft said it has detected a new family of ransomware, dubbed DearCry, exploiting the compromises. Ransomware expert Brett Callow of the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft said the website ID Ransomware had so far received six submissions of the malware - from victims in the United States, Australia, Austria, Canada and Denmark. Microsoft said in a tweet that it was blocking the ransomware, but, said Callow, \"That\u00b4ll not necessary stop attacks.\" Antivirus products detect and block a lot of known ransomware - but hackers often disable those products prior to deployment, he said. The global ransomware scourge - primarily the work of Russian-speaking and North Korean cybercriminals - has cost businesses, local governments, health care providers and even K-12 school districts tens of billions of dollars in the past few years. ____ Bajak reported from Boston.",

The couple was given the nickname, J-Rod, three years ago after they landed on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine.

        "full article": "The Sacramento Kings will try to build on their second-half momentum on Saturday when they visit the Atlanta Hawks, who have won three straight since changing coaches. Sacramento emerged from the NBA All-Star break to defeat the Houston Rockets 125-105 on Thursday. It was the team's third win in five games following a nine-game losing streak. Atlanta, meantime, stole one from the Toronto Raptors, erasing a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit and winning 121-120 on Tony Snell's 3-pointer at the buzzer. This is the first meeting between the two clubs this season. The Kings won the only meeting last year in Atlanta; the rematch was a COVID-19 casualty. Sacramento has won four in a row against the Hawks, including the last two in Atlanta. On Thursday, the Kings got a 30-point effort from De'Aaron Fox, who is averaging 23.2 points. Fox has scored 30-plus points in the last two games and seven times this season. He scored six points during a 15-0 second-quarter run that gave Sacramento the lead for good against Houston. Perhaps the only negative from the win was the 15 turnovers committed. Twice the Kings were whistled for shot-clock violations. \"It was a good effort from our group, but we know we've got to get a lot better,\" Kings coach Luke Walton said. \"At times it was sloppy.\" The Kings are now 15-15 when starting Fox, Harrison Barnes, Marvin Bagley III, Richaun Holmes and Buddy Hield. But otherwise, they're 0-7. Barnes is averaging 16.8 and Hield 16.5. Holmes, Barnes and Hield each scored 20 against the Rockets. The Kings are being cautious with minutes for rookie Tyrese Haliburton as he returns from a calf injury that caused him to miss four games. He played more than 18 minutes against Houston. Haliburton averages 13 points. \"We want more minutes, but they are what they are,\" Walton said. \"We're thrilled to have him back, but we're going to be careful with him and make sure we keep him throughout the rest of this grind-out season.\" The Hawks are 3-0 since coach Lloyd Pierce was fired and replaced by Nate McMillan. The team is 5-1 under McMillan, who was interim head coach while Pierce missed three games. They have converted all five of their fourth-quarter leads under McMillan. Atlanta has mounted fierce comebacks in its last two wins. On March 3 against Orlando, they trailed by 16 with 6:08 left and won 115-112. On Thursday they trailed by 15 with 6:15 left and won. \"It's a 48-minute game,\" McMillan said. \"You're going to be up, you're going to be down. The game is not over until that 48 minutes is up. I thought we did a real good job in our last two games of staying together, getting stops and making plays and shots to win.\" Trae Young is averaging 26.7 points and 9.3 assists to lead the Hawks. He scored 37 in the win over Toronto and set up Snell's winning basket. Over the last four games Clint Capela is averaging 17.8 rebounds and 3.3 blocks. He leads the NBA in offensive rebounds with 5.0 per game, the second-highest single-season average on the offensive glass in team history. Kevin Willis averaged 5.2 offensive rebounds in 1991-92. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - A top leader with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said Friday political donations made in his name to several Democratic candidates, including President Joe Biden, that violate the faith's political neutrality rules were done by his family. Dieter Uchtdorf said in a statement provided by church officials that the contributions came from an online family account associated with his name. \"I regret such an oversight on my part,\" Uchtdorf said. \"I fully support the church\u00b4s policy related to political donations from church leaders.\" Uchtdorf is a member of a top governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which sits below the first presidency and helps set church policy and oversees the faith\u00b4s business interests. A church rule created in 2011 when church member Mitt Romney was running for the GOP presidential nomination dictate that members of this panel and other full-time church leaders and their spouses should not participate in political campaigns or give donations. The church tries to be careful to maintain political neutrality by refraining from backing one party or endorsing candidates, though leaders sometimes weigh in on what they consider crucial moral issues.          FILE - Dieter F. Uchtdorf, a top leader with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, speaks during a news conference on Feb. 7, 2017, in Salt Lake City.

Uchtdorf is a member of a top governing body called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, which sits below the first presidency and helps set church policy and oversees the faith's business interests. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)  Church officials declined comment Friday beyond providing the statement from Uchtdorf. The fact that Uchtdorf\u00b4s family account donated to Democratic candidates is somewhat surprising considering most members of the faith known widely as the Mormon church lean Republican. Uchtdorf's account gave $1,250 to Biden's campaigns in 2020, according to information from the Federal Elections Commission that Salt Lake City news organizations reported Friday. FEC data shows that nearly $1,000 was given to a candidate through a nonprofit online fundraising platform called ActBlue that supports Democratic candidates. Nearly $600 was given to a pair of Democrats ahead of a Jan. 5 runoff election in Georgia that determined control of the U.S. Senate. Uchtdorf, 80, was twice a refugee of war before he left Germany to immigrate to the U.S. and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Before becoming a full-time church leader in 1996, Uchtdorf was a pilot for the German airline Lufthansa and later served in management roles, including vice president of flight operations and chief pilot. Members of the faith have deep-rooted conservative leanings that lead most to vote GOP, including in Utah where the governor and the state\u00b4s entire congressional delegation are Republicans. President Donald Trump won Utah in 2016 and 2020 but never gained widespread acceptance among church members, due in part to his brash style and his remarks about women and immigrants that clashed with the faith\u00b4s culture that places a high value on manners, amiability and public diplomacy. ____ This story has been clarified to say that FEC data shows that nearly $1,000 was given to a candidate through a nonprofit online fundraising platform called ActBlue that supports Democratic candidates.

RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: RB Josh Adams, LB Frankie Luvu, LB Harvey Langi. NEEDS: The Jets have plenty of holes - and lots of money to fill them. The first order of business is to settle their quarterback situation, whether that's sticking with Sam Darnold, moving on and going through the draft (BYU's Zach Wilson or Ohio State's Justin Fields?) or perhaps a trade (Deshaun Watson?). New York, which has close to $70 million in salary cap space, needs some playmakers around whoever is under center. So a wide receiver to pair with steady vet Jamison Crowder and the promising Denzel Mims is a priority - as is help in the backfield. General manager Joe Douglas will also look to improve an offensive line that has struggled the last two seasons, with standout rookie Mekhi Becton and center Connor McGovern potentially the only returnees. Finding a consistent pass rusher, along with depth in the secondary and at inside linebacker will also be top items on Douglas' shopping list for new coach Robert Saleh's defense.

        "full article": "GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) - Michael McDowell gripped the wheel of his kart and hung on the best he could as an elementary-school aged boy bumped him from behind and prepared for the pass. There was no doubt about it - the most recent Daytona 500 winner was in big trouble. \"I'm not 80 pounds anymore,\" McDowell said laughing. \"These guys were all over me.\" The 36-year-old McDowell got a big thrill - and so did a few dozen boys between the ages of 7 and 16 - when he came back to the kart track in suburban Phoenix where he learned to race when he was growing up a few miles away. It was a typical Thursday night under the lights, with the kids zipping around the asphalt track, having fun, working on their karts and learning the fundamentals of racing. The only difference? That very large driver in the full Love's firesuit squeezed behind the wheel of one of the karts.          Daytona 500 winner Michael McDowell prepares to race karts with kids ages 7 to 12 years old on Thursday night, March 11, 2021, at a track in Glendale, Ariz. McDowell grew up in Glendale and raced at the track when he was a kid. (AP Photo/David Brandt)  \"It's still the purest form of motorsports,\" McDowell said. \"It's so much fun to come out here, work on your stuff, learn about the feel and learn how to set up a pass. The community of racing. It's something I've always been passionate about.\" The opportunity to come back to his hometown as the reigning Daytona 500 champion seemed like something that was unthinkable even six weeks ago. A 100-1 underdog when the race began, McDowell won for the first time in 358 Cup starts after Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski wrecked on the final lap, allowing McDowell to drive through the crash scene for a stunning upset. McDowell's still the same humble, self-deprecating guy that he was before the win. He even helped lug his own Daytona 500 trophy across the parking lot before jumping in front of the microphone. The veteran racer said he hasn't changed as a person since the win, but it's still a little surreal. \"Who you are, what you do, it doesn't really change,\" McDowell said. \"But it does give me a chance to have a bigger platform, to help encourage and inspire young racers coming up.\" McDowell grew up a few miles south of the Glendale track and would often ride his mountain bike across the desert terrain to go and compete. His dad was on the board of the track. \"It wasn't like we just showed up, we were a part of the club,\" McDowell said. \"I was here when we put the asphalt down.\" McDowell pointed to different sections of the track, showing where they had to level out bumps to make for a smoother ride. He hadn't been back for nearly 15 years and said he was pleased that the next generation was taking such good care of it. He hopes the sport continues to become more accessible and allow kids from different backgrounds to participate. \"Karting is getting to be a little less expensive at the entry level, but it's still a little too expensive,\" McDowell said. \"There needs to be more development, there needs to be more manufacturing and team dollars poured into karting like it is in Europe. \"There's a gap that needs to be filled but karting, as a whole, is doing really well.\" ___ Follow David Brandt at www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP ___ More AP NASCAR: https://apnews.com/hub/NASCAR          Michael McDowell celebrates after winning the NASCAR Daytona 500 auto race at Daytona International Speedway, Monday, Feb. 15, 2021, in Daytona Beach, Fla.

This third round of pandemic impact payments for many families will be more generous than the two prior rounds, with $1,400 going to every individual earning up to $75,000 or married couples earning up to $150,000, and the same amount for each of their dependents. That means a typical family of four will receive $5,600. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will send payments directly to everyone who filed a tax return this year or last year, anyone who registered with the IRS or who is already receiving government benefits such as Social Security. An IRS official said paper checks will go out later in the month for those who do not have direct deposit, but unlike his predecessor President Joe Biden's name will not appear on those checks. Treasury and IRS officials urged workers to file a tax return even if they would not normally do so since they also could be eligible for other benfits under the stimulus package, including child tax credits or the Earned Income Tax Credit for low wage workers.",

Greece insists the 5th century BC sculptures were stolen, but Boris Johnson says they were 'legally acquired by Lord Elgin under the appropriate laws of the time'Although Mr Johnson has previously said the Marbles should remain in the British Museum, it is the first time he has commented on the issue as Prime Minister.The remarks are likely to trigger fresh controversy. Greece insists the sculptures, which date from 5th century BC, were stolen by Elgin, a diplomat, from the Acropolis in Athens more than 200 years ago.

A long-running historical dispute: What are the Elgin Marbles?  The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants.The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon.\u00a0As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site.His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around \u00a370,000.The sculptures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism.They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail.The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal.However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable.Advertisement",

'We had the better chances and the one chance they had it's a deflection that goes in. That's hard to take, but I guess that's football.'We kept fighting to the end. Jacob Murphy crossed it and I just went for it, and considering we were 1-0 down it's a good point to take.'\u00a0\u00a0'It takes character and leadership and we've got to stick together.\u00a0We've got a really tight group.

'It was the least we deserved.\u00a0'Still 10 games [to go], we are unbeaten in the last couple, albeit draws.

        "title": "Griffin demands early results from Dragons",
        "full article": "Anthony Griffin admits he feared at times he'd never coach in the NRL again, but he never doubted his ability in his two seasons out of the game. Griffin will make his return to the coach's box in St George Illawarra's opener against Cronulla on Sunday, 951 days since he was controversially sacked by Penrith. The 54-year-old has been handed arguably the league's hardest job, with the Dragons already equal-favourites for the wooden spoon. But he doesn't see it that way, certain it's the right fit after making the finals in his last year at both Brisbane and the Panthers. \"At times you do (wonder if you'll get another chance),\" Griffin told AAP. \"What happened at Penrith was funny circumstances. \"I played my part in that. I don't blame anyone or have any animosity towards the club. I've moved on. \"The first thing I had to do was sort out if I wanted to get back. That didn't take too long. \"I've always had a belief in myself that I can help clubs and help build clubs. I think I've proven that over the past seven or eight years.\" Griffin says he is the same coach he's always been, albeit perhaps a little mellower since first coaching Dragons players Ben Hunt, Corey Norman and Andrew McCullough in Brisbane's under-20s. But what he won't do is label this Dragons' job a rebuild. He's adamant winning must start immediately, under an entirely-new coaching staff following the exits of Paul McGregor, Dean Young and Shane Flanagan. \"We have just put in the structures and systems we want and think will help with the players,\" Griffin said. \"A lot is built around the players we have and trying to strengthen their strengths, rather than saying we want you to play a certain way. \"I'm not coming in saying we need to rebuild everything or it's going to be a five-year plan or anything like that. \"In the NRL it's about next week. I've got a broader outlook but from Sunday night we need to be flat out and winning games.\" Much of that will fall on Hunt. Griffin had no hesitation in making him captain and returning him to halfback, buoyed by resilience he's seen from him while so often a punching bag for critics. \"With the 2015 grand final (Hunt) went within one Brisbane defensive play of leading them to their first Premiership in nine years,\" Griffin said. \"It's what Brisbane have been screaming out for. That's just how fickle the business is. \"Then his first year at St George Illawarra he was superb. The ($1 million) price tag's not his problem. \"That's St George Illawarra's problem, they paid that. He can only accept what's offered to him. \"But he's a really strong personality within himself, which gives you an insight into how he's been able to continue to perform. \"He had no hesitation in wanting the (captaincy) job once we had the conversation. Even three or four years ago he might have had second thoughts.\"",

        "full article": "Brisbane Roar youngster Rahmat Akbari says matching wits with top quality players such as Western United's Alessandro Diamanti is the next challenge in his rapidly advancing career. The 20-year-old has been a regular in the Roar's starting XI this A-League season and his form was rewarded earlier this week with the club announcing he'd signed a contract extension. His short-term future secure, Akbari is now focusing on continuing to make his mark in the A-League, starting with Sunday's face-off against a United team led by their influential Italian. The reigning Johnny Warren Medallist missed Wednesday's loss to Sydney FC but is expected to be back in Mark Rudan's line-up when the Roar travel to AAMI Park on Sunday. \"I always want to challenge myself. Play against the better players of the league such as a Diamanti,\" Akbari told AAP. \"I want to show what I can do against them. \"I don't want to be just an ordinary young player. I want to be a big player.\" Roar coach Warren Moon praised Akbari's efforts so far this season after the pair had sat down before the start of the campaign to have a frank discussion about the youngster's ambition. Having made just 20 appearances, most of them as a substitute over the past three seasons, the Afghan-born midfielder has played in all 10 of Brisbane's games this season, starting in nine. \"Basically I put the ball in his court about what he wanted to achieve and where he wanted to go,\" Moon said. \"This is a reward, which is all him, he's put the work in and he's put the performances in and I just couldn't be happier for him.\" Akbari has already outlined his intention to push for Australia's Olympic squad later this year and his long-term ambitions extend further than that as well. \"Right now I'm focusing on Brisbane Roar this season and next season but it's in the plan to go to Europe.\" KEY MATCH STATS * This will be Western United's fourth match at AAMI Park and they are yet to win at the Melbourne venue. * Former Brisbane striker Besart Berisha has been involved in five of Western United past seven goals, scoring four and setting up another. * Brisbane have conceded the opening goal in just three of their 10 matches this season but have lost every game in which their opponent scores first.",

The Washington State Board of Regents approved the 10-year agreement with Gesa Credit Union on Friday. The Cougars' home football field will now be known as Gesa Field at Martin Stadium. \"We know how Cougs are, and how loyal they are to their institution and that logo,\" Washington State athletic director Pat Chun said. \"We\u00b4re excited to see how that impacts Gesa in the short term and in the long term.\" The new revenue stream for Washington State athletics will boost a department budget that is facing a deficit of more than $30 million. The Cougars were already facing a $22 million gap and the deficit grew by nearly $10 million in part because of distribution losses from the Pac-12 and NCAA, and because no fans were allowed at sporting events last year. \"It\u00b4s going to be a new revenue line item for us and a critical one as we try to go forward,\" Chun said. Washington State first entered into conversations with Gesa Credit Union in February 2020 prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The pandemic allowed both sides to do plenty of due diligence on what this deal needs to look like. And these deals are complex,\" Chun said. \"It\u00b4s a testament to where we\u00b4re at, at Washington State University, to be able to get this done through a pandemic with all the things going on here.\" ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",

        "full article": "Winning once under Darryl Sutter is a good thing. Anybody who has played for him over his distinguished coaching career will tell you victories are far better than the alternative. That said, the Calgary Flames received a key message from their new head coach as they prepare host the Montreal Canadiens in a Saturday night rematch: Leave it in the past. Among Sutter's calling cards is his insistence that the last game is less important than the next one, which is a good lesson for the Flames, who are a .500 team that has struggled this season to follow victories with another strong effort. \"Every win ... there's lots of them,\" Sutter said. \"They're all the same. You take it and get ready for the next one.\" The Flames earned full marks in Thursday's 2-1 win over the Canadiens, a clash in which they grabbed two-goal lead and held on for a solid win. Calgary controlled the tempo with an aggressive and smart forecheck and held the visitors to only 18 shots on goal en route to handing Montreal only its second road regulation-time defeat. \"It's very obvious how he wants us to play,\" forward Derek Ryan said. \"He wants a fast-paced game, structured, and I think that's what you saw for just about a full 60 minutes. I thought everybody was confident and 100 percent in what we needed to do on the ice in every shift, and no one was hesitating or questioning anything. It was a lot of fun to play that way.\" That said, the Flames are expecting a better Montreal team on Saturday. The Canadiens put up a strong fight Thursday despite playing the previous night in Vancouver. Not only did they switch time zones, but the game against the Canucks was a late start. Fatigue definitely was a factor when they hit the Saddledome ice. \"The lack of energy led to a lack of execution,\" said coach Dominique Ducharme. \"We had less quick options. We were slow to react. They had more time to pressure us. We made mental mistakes because of our energy level.\" Since Ducharme took the coaching reins on Feb. 24, the Canadiens have a 3-2-3 record. Thursday marked the second time this season the Canadiens have played on consecutive nights after switching cities -- both second games were losses. \"You always have to take something away from every game. ... We'll learn from this,\" Ducharme said. \"We'll react better next time. It's tough to compare a game like (Thursday) to our performance on Wednesday. It wasn't the same conditions. We'll use the lessons learned from tonight in the future.\" \"Sometimes it's just not there,\" forward Jonathan Drouin added. \"When it's not there as a team, we have to find those ways to do the little things right and make sure we're on the same page. It's not going to be a pretty night. We're going to get nights like that when it's not flowing the way it should be, but we'll get better at that where we've got to figure out our game when we're not having it.\" Neither team will be forced to make roster changes, but expect Montreal will turn to star goaltender Carey Price on Saturday after Jake Allen faced the Flames. Price, who played Wednesday's game in Vancouver, has surrendered one goal in each of his last four games, in which he's stopped 105 of 109 shots -- a sparkling .963 save percentage. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Singer Jennifer Lopez and former New York Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez were reported on Friday to have split up after almost four years together. Celebrity website TMZ, the New York Post's Page Six and multiple entertainment websites cited unidentified sources close to the couple as saying the pair had called off their engagement. Representatives for Lopez, 51, and Rodriguez, 45, one of the biggest celebrity couples in the United States, did not return requests for comment on the reports. The \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" singer and Rodriguez, known as A-Rod, began dating in early 2017 and announced their engagement in March 2019. Entertainment Tonight said Lopez called off the relationship. \"Jennifer felt like moving forward to marriage wasn't right. Recently Alex\u00b4s character has been called into question and that didn\u00b4t sit right with Jennifer,\" the outlet quoted a source as saying. \"The couple will always have respect for each other.\" The split follows recent rumors linking A-Rod with one of the stars of TV reality show \"Southern Charm.\" Lopez, who sang at U.S. President Joe Biden's inauguration in January, said late last year the couple had postponed their wedding twice because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Rodriguez's 22-year career, he hit 696 home runs, placing him fourth on Major League Baseball\u00b4s all-time home run list. He retired in 2016. Lopez, who began her career as a dancer and a singer, produced and starred in the 2019 movie \"Hustlers.\" She has 13 year-old twins from a previous relationship with singer Marc Anthony, and had a high-profile but short-lived romance with actor Ben Affleck. The couple, known in the media as J-Rod, were last photographed together in late February in a romantic embrace in the Dominican Republic, where she is shooting a movie.

        "full article": "The NCAA Football Rules Committee on Friday recommended a slight change to overtime rules that would require a team to try a two-point conversion after a touchdown when a game reaches the second overtime instead of the third. The committee also addressed the problem of teams faking injuries to slow an opponent's momentum and blocking below the waist, among other areas. Changes must be approved by the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel, which is scheduled to discuss football rules recommendations April 22. The overtime recommendation was based on player safety and intended to reduce the number of plays it takes for a winner to be determined. National coordinator of officials Steve Shaw said overtime games add an average of 16.4 plays to a contest. The new rule would have teams run alternating two-point plays in the third overtime instead of starting another drive at the opponent\u00b4s 25-yard line. Alternating two-point plays currently start in the fifth overtime. Teams could still choose whether to kick the point after touchdown or run a two-point conversion play in the first overtime.

The NCAA Football Rules Committee on Friday, March 12, 2021, recommended a slight change to overtime rules that would require a team to try a two-point conversion after a touchdown when a game reaches the second overtime instead of the third. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)  The committee has discussed the issue of faking injuries in recent years and now is proposing that a school or conference be allowed to ask Shaw for a postgame video review about questionable actions. \"Any time a player is injured, we want to honor that injury and make sure they get their full protection, but feigning injuries is an integrity issue and something we don't want in the game,\" Shaw said. Still to be determined is what repercussions there would be if a player were found to have faked an injury. The committee plans to review injury data for the 2021 season before deciding whether to recommend changes to rules regarding blocking below the waist. Members are looking at limiting blocking below the waist to inside the tackle box, which is the area spanning the length of the offensive line and extending from the line of scrimmage to the opponent's goal line. The committee supported the team area being permanently extended to the 20-yard lines. The team area now stretches between the 25-yard lines, but the area was expanded to the 15-yard lines in 2020 to create more social-distancing space because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The committee also listed three points of emphasis for 2021. Officials will crack down on any taunting directed toward an opponent, Shaw said, because taunting reflects poorly on the game and can lead to unnecessary confrontations. Officials will be on the look-out for uniform violations and will send the player out of the game to correct the issue. This will include specifically the pants, jerseys and T-shirts. Also, coaches who enter the field of play or leave the team area to debate officiating decisions will be committing an automatic unsportsmanlike conduct foul. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",

        "full article": "BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) - A Guatemalan woman who has been living in a Massachusetts church for more than three years to avoid deportation has been granted a reprieve to remain in the country for now. Maria Macario was issued a one-year stay of her deportation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials during a meeting at its Burlington office earlier this week, according to Rev. John Gibbons of the First Parish church in Bedford. The stay allows her to seek a work permit, pursue legal options and come and go from the church without fear of being apprehended by immigration officials, the pastor said in an email to supporters. The 55-year-old was ordered to leave the country years ago when her family lost their asylum case. Her husband and eldest son were deported, prompting her to take sanctuary at First Parish. Macario was among more than 70 immigrants nationwide who took shelter in churches during President Donald Trump's administration. Churches have long been treated as off-limits for immigration enforcement. Last month, a Honduran man left a church in Maplewood, Missouri, that he'd been living in for more than three years, following assurances from ICE that it would not pursue his detention or removal.          Maria Macario poses for a portrait at the First Parish church, Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021, in Bedford, Mass. For three years, Macario has been too afraid to leave the confines of the church, which she moved in to avoid deportation, spending most of her time in a converted Sunday school classroom stocked with a hot plate, mini-fridge, TV and single bed. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)  Gibbons said Macario doesn't plan to leave the church immediately as she looks to secure a new apartment. The church community also hopes to celebrate her victory virtually, he said. \"Maria is relieved, overjoyed, and thankful to God and to all who have helped and accompanied her for the last three years,\" Gibbons wrote. ICE officials didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",

        "full article": "Boris Johnson's plan to cut the foreign aid budget is set to be dramatically scaled back over fears of a Tory rebellion.Ministers had announced they would change the law to lower the target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on international development to 0.5 per cent.This would have allowed them to slash handouts by \u00a34billion to around \u00a310billion and keep them at a lower level for years.But amid warnings that the proposals, which would breach a 2019 Tory election manifesto pledge, will be blocked in both houses of Parliament, the Government is considering alternatives such as missing the 0.7 per cent target as a one-off this year and returning to it in 2022.       Ministers had announced they would change the law to lower the target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on international development to 0.5 per cent.

Harry and Meghan, the inconvenient truth: Dossier reveals...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n This means that the foreign aid bill could jump back to around \u00a314billion in just a year.Officials are studying whether the one-off cut could be done through a loophole which allows the target to be missed for reasons such as the economic situation without the need for a new law. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had previously discounted this option.As he announced the proposed aid cuts last November, Mr Raab told MPs a new law was needed as the Government was not 'able to rely just on the limited derogation written into [existing] legislation'.         Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest continuously serving MP, said he will 'work with anyone across' the Commons to 'fight to maintain' his party's 0.7 per cent pledge on overseas aidHe said: 'We have taken advice very carefully on this, and it is very clear that if we cannot see a path back to 0.7 per cent in the foreseeable, immediate future and we cannot plan for that, then the legislation would require us to change it. We would almost certainly face legal challenge if we do not very carefully follow it.'The Prime Minister, Mr Raab and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are to decide in the coming weeks whether to introduce a new law as planned so the aid budget can be lowered for several years, or whether to just reduce it this year. If they decide on the latter, it is understood they will claim the improving economic picture is the reason for the U-turn.The Daily Mail revealed last month that the Government had postponed a vote on cutting foreign aid to avoid a clash with Tory backbenchers ahead of the G7 summit in June. Ministers are keen to avoid the embarrassment of a row about Britain's place in the world as Mr Johnson prepares to welcome world leaders, including US president Joe Biden, to the Cornwall summit.Senior Tories including Theresa May and David Davis warned they will join a revolt led by former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell if the Government attempts to bring in new legislation. Mr Mitchell has claimed the cuts will be the 'cause of 100,000 preventable deaths, mainly among children'.Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest continuously serving MP, said he will 'work with anyone across' the Commons to 'fight to maintain' his party's 0.7 per cent pledge on overseas aid.In a Mail article earlier this year, Mrs May warned Britain would be 'abandoning our position of global moral leadership' by cutting the aid target. 'Whatever the rhetoric we deploy, it is our actions which count. So, we should do nothing which signals a retreat from our global commitments,' she wrote.",

        "title": "Prominent U.S. political figures accused of sexual misconduct",
        "full article": "March 12 (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is the latest of numerous major U.S. political figures in both parties to be faced with sexual misconduct accusations and calls to step down. Cuomo insisted on Friday that he would not resign despite calls for him to do so from a growing list of fellow New York Democrats unwilling to await the outcome of two investigations into the claims that seven women have made against him. Here is a list of some recent political figures who have faced accusations of sexual misconduct during their public lives. Reuters has not independently confirmed the accusations against Cuomo or against the other political figures. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN Even before he formally entered the Democratic presidential race, a former Nevada assemblywoman accused Joe Biden in March 2019 of inappropriately touching her and kissing her on the head at a campaign rally in 2014. Days later, a Connecticut woman said he touched her inappropriately, and rubbed noses with her at a 2009 political fundraiser. Biden responded with a video in which he pledged to be \"more mindful\" of respecting \"personal space.\" In March 2020, a former Senate staff assistant accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, which Biden and his campaign denied. Biden was elected president in November with a record 81.3 million votes. FORMER NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN Eric Schneiderman resigned as New York attorney general in May 2018 after New Yorker magazine reported that four woman with whom he had had romantic relationships or encounters alleged that he had abused them. Scheiderman contested the allegations, but stepped down within hours of their publication following a call from Cuomo to do so. FORMER SENATOR AL FRANKEN OF MINNESOTA Al Franken left his U.S. Senate seat in January 2018 after sexual misconduct accusations that prompted most of his Democratic colleagues to press him to resign. Franken, a former comedian from Minnesota, denied some of the allegations that he had groped and tried to kiss women without their consent, adding that \"Others I remember very differently.\" Calls for Franken's ouster came while a Senate Ethics Committee investigation was pending. A year and a half later, Franken said he regretted quitting and seven of his Democratic colleagues said they regretted having urged him to do so. FORMER ALABAMA SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE ROY MOORE After sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Republican Roy Moore, he lost his bid to represent reliably conservative Alabama in the U.S. Senate in a special election in 2017 in a stunning upset to Democrat Doug Jones. Moore, a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, was accused by several women of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers and Moore was in his early 30s. He denied the accusations. FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE JOHN CONYERS Michigan Democrat John Conyers stepped down in December 2017 as the longest serving member of the U.S. House of Representatives after several accusations of sexual misconduct. At the time, the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into the allegations of several former female aides whose accusations included inappropriate touching and that he came to a meeting in only his underwear. Conyers denied the allegations. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency in November 2016 in the face of several sexual misconduct allegations. By the end of his first year in office, Trump had piled up accusations of unwanted sexual advances from more than a dozen women, who said the incidents occurred long before he entered politics, many of them in the 1990s. Trump denied the accusations, and his White House accused the women of lying. The allegations included unwanted kissing and groping. Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020 but still received 74.2 million votes, the second-highest total ever. U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH The U.S. Senate confirmed Brett Kavanaugh as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in October 2018, notwithstanding a 36-year-old sexual assault allegation that became the subject of grueling testimony. University professor Christine Blasey Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she feared Kavanaugh would rape and accidentally kill her during the alleged assault in 1982, when both were high school students in Maryland. Kavanaugh, who was nominated by Trump, \"unequivocally and categorically\" denied the allegation. FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR ELIOT SPITZER Eliot Spitzer stepped down as New York governor in March 2008 after a report surfaced that he had patronized a prostitute ring. Spitzer, a Democrat, apologized for his \"private failings,\" but did not refer specifically to the report at the time. Months later, he admitted his involvement with the ring after a federal prosecutor declined to bring charges. (Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty and Daniel Wallis)",

        "full article": "The goaltending of Connor Hellebuyck in the first two games is a key reason why the visiting Winnipeg Jets have a chance to win their three-game series against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday night. The teams split the first two games. Hellebuyck has been superb in the first two games as Winnipeg took the opener 4-3 on Tuesday and forced the Maple Leafs to overtime on Thursday before losing 4-3. \"Me, personally, I stole a lot of goals (Thursday),\" said Hellebuyck, who made 34 saves, many of them spectacular. He could not stop a backhand by Auston Matthews, however, 59 seconds into overtime. \"He played really well,\" said Matthews, who has 21 goals. \"You've got to tip your hat to him, he made some incredible saves. We had some really good looks, some really good chances and he came up big. ... I'm proud of the way everybody really stuck with it.\" Paul Stastny had tied the game for Winnipeg late in the third period with Hellebuyck off for an extra attacker. \"Our goalie was outstanding, there's no question,\" Jets captain Blake Wheeler said. \"That should be the storyline. He stood on his head for us. But we also have a locker room full of guys who played their (butts) off, too.\" Hellebuyck was asked if he felt as if he was being \"hung out to dry\" through parts of the game. \"I'm never going to use those words,\" he said. \"I did my job. The guys in front of me got us to OT, so they clearly did their job. Not every night is going to be perfect. Not every night is going to be a defensive win, not every night you're going to get the best goaltending. That's what I love about this team. We have it all and we can do it all.\" Nikolaj Ehlers had two goals and an assist for the Jets. He leads the team with 13 goals. The victory by the Maple Leafs ended the first three-game losing streak since Sheldon Keefe took over on Nov. 20, 2019. The Maple Leafs have completed the first half of their 56-game regular season with a record of 19-7-2 (40 points). Matthews has three goals in the series (two on Tuesday) in the series after going five games without one. He has been playing with a wrist injury that forced him to miss two games. The overtime goal was scored after a slash broke the stick of Maple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly deep in Toronto's end, with no penalty called. Rielly skated to the bench to get a new stick before setting up Matthews, after getting the puck from Mitchell Marner. \"Elite talent,\" Keefe said. \"(Matthews) is a star, that's what they do. The condition of his hand and stuff aside, he was quite tired there, too. That was a long shift. A long shift in overtime. Overtime shifts are difficult. Just to have the energy to get up the ice and put himself in that spot amongst the chaos of the broken stick and all of that nonsense that was happening. That's big-time stuff.\" The Jets will be without defenseman Nathan Beaulieu (hand) for an extended period. He was placed on injured reserve after being hurt on Tuesday while blocking a shot. Defenseman Logan Stanley was promoted from the taxi squad and played 11 minutes on Thursday. --Field Level Media",

France's answer to the Oscars, the ceremony is in normal times the biggest night on the French cinema calendar but on Friday there were no flashbulbs on the red carpet and no partners on the arms of award nominees. The ceremony took place as anger and frustration grows amongst actors, musicians and artists at the government's unwillingness to set a date for the reopening of museums, galleries, concert halls and movie houses. Fois, who hosted the night, took a swipe at Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot for finding time to write a book during the COVID-19 crisis and said: \"I'm losing confidence in you.\" Nor did she hold back from attacking the French government's broader strategy to counter the COVID-19 crisis, as cases in the country topped 4 million. \"They cooped up our youngsters, closed our cinemas and theatres and banned concerts so that they could open churches, because we're a secular country, so that old people could go to church,\" she said. The majority of French people are Roman Catholic. Across the capital, several dozen protesters were occupying the Odeon Theatre for an eighth night demanding cultural venues be reopened and more financial support. French cinema had hoped to put a torrid year behind it. At last year's event, held two weeks before the country went into lockdown, a number of leading actresses walked out after the French-Polish director Roman Polanski, who faces rape accusations, won best director for \"An Officer and a Spy\".

        "full article": "A man charged with conspiring with members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia group in the attack on the U.S. Capitol will be released from jail while he awaits trial, a judge ruled Friday after challenging the strength of the evidence against him. The decision is a serious blow for prosecutors, who fought to keep Thomas Caldwell locked up, calling him a a threat to the community and major player in the Oath Keepers' plot to stop the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. Judge Amit Mehta of U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. expressed concerns with Caldwell's conduct, but noted that Caldwell did not enter the Capitol and said there is no direct evidence that Caldwell plotted in advance to do so. \"There are no text message communications by him that speak to actually entering the building or trying to enter the building and ultimately he did not enter the building,\" Mehta said. \"There is evidence here that I think is favorable to Mr. Caldwell,\" the judge added. The judge also noted that Caldwell of Berryville, Virginia, is suffering from serious medical issues issues behind bars. He ordered him to be released to 24-hour home confinement with GPS monitoring.          An illuminated traffic barrier is seen on the Capitol grounds before sunrise in Washington, Monday, March 8, 2021. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  Caldwell is one of nine defendants linked to the Oath Keepers and charged with conspiring with one another in the Jan. 6 attack that resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer. It's the biggest conspiracy case the U.S. has brought so far in the Capitol attack, as investigators narrow in on organized extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and another far-right group, the Proud Boys. Authorities have acknowledged there\u00b4s no evidence Caldwell was a dues-paying member of the Oath Keepers but have described him as a supporter who appeared to play a \"leadership role\" within the group. Caldwell's lawyer, David Fischer, said prosecutors have provided no evidence that the riot was anything but spontaneous. Fischer said Caldwell is \"suffering\" in jail and has been unable to get the medical attention he needs for serious back issues. \"He has been perhaps the most honest straightforward client I've had in 25 years, and I truly believe this man is innocent,\" Fisher told the judge. Prosecutors say Caldwell and the Oath Keepers were not whipped into a frenzy by President Donald Trump on Jan. 6 but came into Washington prepared for violence and intent on stopping the certification of the vote. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Leigh Rakoczy said the Oath Keepers were \"prepared to do whatever was necessary to stop the certification\" but conceded prosecutors do not have records in which someone explicitly says the plan was to breach the Capitol. Authorities have said the Oath Keepers and their associates prepared in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6 as if they were going to war, discussing things like weapons and training. Days before the attack, Caldwell suggested in a text message getting a boat to ferry weapons across the Potomac River to their \"waiting arms,\" prosecutors say. The Oath Keepers also discussed stationing a \"quick reaction force\" outside Washington that could bring in weapons \"if something goes to hell,\" according to court documents. Hours after the siege, Caldwell was already talking about another attack \"at the local level,\" authorities said. \"If we\u00b4d had guns I guarantee we would have killed 100 politicians. They ran off and were spirited away through their underground tunnels like the rats they were,\" Caldwell said in one message, according to court documents.",

        "full article": "The Biden administration offered temporary legal residency Friday to people from Myanmar, where military leaders have overthrown the country's elected government and are using deadly force against protesters. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the temporary protected status would last for 18 months. The designation applies to people from that country already living in the United States. Myanmar's military seized power Feb. 1, hours before the seating of a new parliament following election results that were seen as a rebuff to the country's generals. The coup upended internationally backed efforts to restore democracy and end decades of junta rule. Security forces have killed dozens of protesters since the coup. Mayorkas said in a statement that the takeover has worsened humanitarian conditions, disrupted aid and medical flights into the country and brought on an economic crisis, making it difficult for Myanmar nationals and longtime residents to return to the country safely.          People light candles on the street during a night demonstration despite a curfew imposed by authorities in Yangon, Myanmar on Friday, Mar. 12, 2021. Police in Myanmar fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters in the country's two largest cities and elsewhere on Friday, as authorities continued their harsh crackdown on opponents of last month's military coup.

        "full article": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand are demanding New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo resign - becoming the most powerful Democratic voices to call for him to leave office in the wake of sexual harassment allegations.\u00a0Schumer and Gillibrand, who serve as New York's two sitting senators, released a joint statement Friday afternoon, which read: 'Confronting and overcoming the Covid crisis requires sure and steady leadership. We commend the brave actions of the individuals who have come forward with serious allegations of abuse and misconduct.\u00a0\u00a0'Due to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York. Governor Cuomo should resign.'Both had previously said an independent investigation into the allegations against Cuomo was essential.Shortly after the Senators' joint statement was released, House Intelligence Chairman and California Rep. Adam Schiff also urged Cuomo to resign.\u00a0'I don't think he can carry on,' Schiff told Wolf Blitzer on CNN.\u00a0Meanwhile, New York State Comprtoller Tom DiNapooli tweeted: 'These allegations are extremely disturbing and are impairing Governor Cuomo\u2019s ability to lead, as our state struggles through a crisis and must make critical budget decisions. It is time for him to step down.'Earlier on Friday, New York representatives Jerry Nadler and\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0joined 12 of the 17 other New York Congressional Democrats also demanding that the Governor step aside.\u00a0Pressure is growing on Cuomo as a seventh woman alleged sexual harassment in a first-person essay published in New York magazine on Friday.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a030 women spoke to the same publication claiming they experienced bullying while working for the Governor.\u00a0But a defiant Cuomo told reporters in a conference call Friday that he will not bow to 'cancel culture' by tending his resignation. He then hit out at colleagues who are calling for him to go.\u00a0'Politicians take positions for all sorts of reasons including political expediency and bowing to pressure,' he stated.\u00a0'People know the difference between playing politics, bowing to cancel culture and the truth... let the review proceed.'I am not going to resign. I was not elected by the politicians. I was elected by the people - part of this is that I am not part of the political club and you know what, I'm proud of it.'On Friday evening, Cuomo was seen looking strained as he paced up and down outside the Governor's Mansion in Albany with his daughter, Mariah.At one point, the Governor draped a blanket over his shoulders as he spoke into the phone while sipping from a bottle of Saratoga Springs water.\u00a0         Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand are demanding New York Gov.

His dog, Captain, was also seenIn the same conference call with the reporters on Friday, Cuomo stated:\u00a0'Women have a right to come forward and be heard and I encourage that but I also want to be clear - there is still a question of the truth.'I did not do what has been alleged. Period. I won't speculate about people's possible motives, but I can tell you as a former Attorney General, who's gone through this situation many times, there are often many motivations for making an allegation.'That is why you need to know the facts before you make a decision.'\u00a0He went on to make his case for why he should stay in office, insisting he was the man for the job because he'd been in the public eye 'his entire life' as the son of former NY Governor Mario Cuomo.'The people have known me for 40 years; elected me AG, governor 3 times, I've been in the public eye my entire life.'My entire life, I have been under public scrutiny since I was 23. New Yorkers know me.. I am going to focus on my job because we have real challenges. People say avoid distractions. I am going to avoid distractions and focus on my job - I have to rebuild the state.'         On Friday,\u00a0Cuomo also seemed to suggest that he'd had consensual sexual relationships with some of the women after emphatically denying that he had 'abused, harassed or assaulted' any of them         On Friday,\u00a0Cuomo insisted again - as he did last week - that he never touched anyone inappropriately but accepted that he may have felt people feel 'uncomfortable' while taking photographs with them              New York representatives Jerry Nadler and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Friday issued statements demanding governor Andrew Cuomo to resign amid sexual harassment claims         AOC also released a statement to Twitter after calling for his resignation. 14 of the 17 New York Democrats in Congress are now demanding Cuomo stand downDuring questions, Cuomo insisted again - as he did last week - that he never touched anyone inappropriately but accepted that he may have felt people feel 'uncomfortable' while taking photographs with them.\u00a0Cuomo also seemed to suggest that he'd had consensual sexual relationships with some of the women after emphatically denying that he had 'abused, harassed or assaulted' any of them.\u00a0Rep. Ocasio-Cortez released a statement on Friday which read: 'After two accounts of sexual assault, four accounts of harassment, the Attorney General's investigation finding the Governor's admin hid nursing home data from the legislature & public, we agree with the 55+ members of the New York State legislature that the Governor must resign.'

I knew it would be far easier to smile for the brief moment it takes to snap a picture than to challenge one of the most powerful men in the country.'\u00a0\u00a0The reporter, who now works in Florida, claimed that Cuomo 'never let me forget I was a woman' as she also alleged that he made frequent attempts to humiliated her, including calling our her purple phone instead of answering her question during a press gaggle.\u00a0'Cuomo seemed to think the fact that I had the audacity to speak over a man was hilarious. With him, these exchanges were always meant to be a public humiliation,' she said.\u00a0Yet, Bakeman also claimed that she did not believe Cuomo ever wanted to have sex with her, and that it was instead about 'power'.\u00a0'He wanted me to know that he could take my dignity away at any moment with an inappropriate comment or a hand on my waist,' she states.\u00a0'He wanted me to know that I was powerless, that I was small and weak, that I did not deserve what relative power I had: a platform to hold him accountable for his words and actions.\u00a0'He wanted me to know that he could take my dignity away at any moment with an inappropriate comment or a hand on my waist.'\u00a0'The way he bullies and demeans women is different.

Andrew Cuomo resigns from office?\u00a0           If Cuomo resigns Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul (pictured) would take overAs of Friday afternoon, 14 out of 19 of New York's congressional Democrats have called for Governor Andrew Cuomo's resignation.They are joined by all Democrats in the NY State Senate and by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\u00a0Cuomo on Friday refused to accept that he should resign despite the mounting pressure.If he resigns\u00a0Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul would take over.\u00a0She would finish Cuomo's term until the next scheduled gubernatorial election in 2022.\u00a0Hochul is a Democrat who has served since 2015 and was a NY representative\u00a0for New York's 26th congressional district from 2011 to 2013.She backed an investigation into allegations against Cuomo last month.\u00a0'Everyone deserves to have their voice heard and to be taken seriously. I support an independent review,' she said.\u00a0The last time a governor resigned was in early 2008.\u00a0Gov. Eliot Spitzer left office after he admitted to having extramarital affairs with sex workers.\u00a0When Spitzer stepped down,\u00a0Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took over until 2010.\u00a0Cuomo, then Attorney General, won that election to take over from Paterson.\u00a0To date, a\u00a0lieutenant governor has stepped in to carry out a gubernatorial term in New York on eight occassions, the first one taking place in 1817.\u00a0LG Hochul would also take over if Cuomo is impeached.\u00a0\u00a0New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie authorized its Judiciary Committee to start an impeachment investigation into Cuomo Thursday.\u00a0The last time a NY governor was impeached was in 1913.\u00a0The process in New York is very similar to the impeachment procedure in Congress.\u00a0A simple majority in the state Assembly is required to impeach a governor.\u00a0It then goes to the state impeachment court.\u00a0A two-thirds majority of the state Senate and the justices of the New York Court of Appeals would be required to convict Cuomo and remove him from office.\u00a0The lieutenant governor takes over as acting governor while the trial plays out.

My parents thought I was going nuts'.'I was angry and crying all the time, and I went on Lexapro,' she added. 'I did call in to a suicide hotline because I felt like such a friggin' nobody.'She had previously told the Wall Street Journal that she had started drinking heavily while working with Cuomo's administration before asking to be moved to another office.And she revealed on Thursday that she was among the former aides to receive an allegedly intimidating phone call from top Cuomo aides in December after first accuser Lindsey Boylan came forward.In her first claims earlier this month she said that the governor asked her if she had a boyfriend, touched her on the lower back during an event reception and kissed her on the hand before she asked to move from his office.\u00a0'I felt gross, like I was just an ornament,' Liss said of requests for her to dress up while in the office.She added that had 'never felt more depleted by the male gaze'.'Melissa DeRosa [Cuomo's top aide] had Louboutins, and there were legs everywhere, and I just felt stupid,' Liss said.'I was living in a place that was full of people who were mean and predatory. It ground me down to the lowest point of my life, like I was a piece of nothing and my career was going nowhere.'\u00a0                Cuomo's fourth accuser, Ana Liss, 35, (pictured above) also spoke to New York Magazine as she revealed how her treatment in the office led her to believe 'I was going crazy'The current New York Attorney General Letitia James is currently investigating Cuomo over the women's complaints and over his handling of th data regarding nursing home deaths from COVID-19.\u00a0The new calls for his resignation come a day after New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said he had authorized its Judiciary Committee to start an impeachment investigation into sexual misconduct allegations that six women have made against Cuomo.\u00a0The panel's investigation will run parallel to one being led by AG Letitia James.\u00a0The mounting scandals have also left Cuomo in a weakened position during negotiations over the state budget, which is due on April 1.\u00a0Cuomo has asked the public to await the results of that investigation before making judgment.The third-term governor, who took office in 2011, has pointed to his reelections as indication of strong statewide support, which was bolstered last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0He also touted his administration's passage of liberal goals such as same-sex marriage as evidence that his hard-nosed approach to politics works.\u00a0\u00a0         protestor sits outside the New York State Capitol on Friday, following allegations that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had sexually harassed young women         A group also gathered to protest over the nursing home COVID scandal (pictured)",

        "title": "Wall St Week Ahead-Energy shares look for next spark as investors eye recovering economy",
        "full article": "By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Investors betting on U.S. energy shares have enjoyed a blistering rally, as the sector leads a move into value and economically sensitive stocks that has gripped the equity market. How much further that run continues could hinge on the success of the economic recovery, supply dynamics in oil markets and whether companies can stay disciplined on spending. The near doubling in the price of crude has helped make shares of oil and gas companies - for years a losing bet - one of the best performing areas of the market, with outsized gains in the stocks of companies such as oil major Exxon Mobil Corp and Diamondback Energy Inc, which have surged 89% and 231%, respectively, since early November. With a gain of over 80% in that time, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is back to levels last seen in February 2020, when the stock market began its plunge as the COVID-19 outbreak took its toll on the economy. \"Shares are being bid up because there are expectations for greater demand,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. \"We need to see the follow-through.\" The outlook for energy shares is at the center of a number of market themes, including how long the economic \"reopening\" trade can last, whether energy and other value stocks can continue outperforming tech and growth shares and if the market is primed for a potential rise in inflation. With the benchmark S&amp;P 500 nearing the 4,000 level for the first time, the health of the economy, the pace of inflation and a recent rise in bond yields are expected to be hot topics when the U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. Ample crude supply that weighed on global oil prices and concerns over a push toward \"green energy\" were among the factors pulling down energy stocks for most of the past decade. Oil prices plummeted in the coronavirus-fueled downturn amid global travel restrictions and shutdowns but roared higher in recent months, buoyed by breakthroughs in vaccines against COVID-19. Recent data has shown signs of an economic recovery continuing to gain momentum. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped to a four-month low last week, while U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year. Prices for U.S. crude are up 35% year-to-date. Investors are watching supply dynamics as another catalyst for crude prices and energy stocks. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies last year cut output substantially as demand collapsed due to the pandemic. The group earlier this month agreed to extend most output cuts into April. Any efforts by President Joe Biden's administration to regulate U.S. drilling could support prices by keeping supply in check, investors said. \"There is more likely to be an aggressive regulatory regime, which would rein in supply, which would be a positive for commodity prices,\" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. Investors said they want to see whether companies are spending on new drilling, which could oversupply the market and eventually weigh on prices, or pay down debt and bolster dividends. Five international oil majors cut their capital spending by about 20% on average last year to $80 billion and are expected in aggregate to generally maintain that spending level in 2021, according to Jason Gabelman, senior energy equity research analyst at Cowen. Energy companies \"need to maintain their discipline, they need to stick to capital budgets that are constrained and not drill as much and give investors confidence that this is not going to be a short-lived cycle,\" said Christian Ledoux, director of investment research at CAPTRUST. Setbacks in fighting the virus could undercut the reopening trade and energy shares along with it. Such a scenario risks playing out in Europe, where a more contagious variant of the coronavirus has pushed Italy and France to impose fresh lockdowns. Another factor is how quickly travel might rebound to pre-pandemic levels. \"You may see reopening and people driving more and spending more on commerce, but ... if people are traveling less globally, that is going to result in oil demand not fully recovering to where it was,\" Gabelman said.

        "title": "Panthers aim to maintain momentum vs. surprising Blackhawks",
        "full article": "The Chicago Blackhawks, who have not advanced past the first round of the NHL playoffs since winning their sixth Stanley Cup in 2015, are considered by many to be the league's surprise team this season. On Saturday night, the Blackhawks will visit the Florida Panthers, who have also exceeded expectations so far this season. This will be the first time the teams have met in nearly two months. Host Florida beat Chicago 5-2 on Jan. 17. Two days later, the visiting Blackhawks lost to the Panthers 5-4 on Frank Vatrano's overtime goal. The Panthers enter Saturday's game having won four of their past five games. Many of Florida's 17 wins this season have been of the comeback variety, including Thursday's 5-4 overtime win over Columbus when the Panthers trailed 4-2 in the third period. \"I think we're a relentless team,\" said Vatrano, who has two of Florida's four overtime goals this year. \"It's a good identity to have.\" That Jan. 19 Panthers-Blackhawks matchup marked the NHL debut for Chicago goalie Kevin Lankinen, who played four seasons in Liiga, the top professional league in his native Finland, and two years in the American Hockey League. Lankinen has helped steady the Blackhawks, who fell to 0-3-1 after that second Panthers loss. Since then, however, the Blackhawks are 14-6-4. For the season, Lankinen, 25, has established himself as a favorite for the Calder Trophy, given to the NHL's top rookie. He is 10-4-4 with a 2.72 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage. \"Whenever I get the chance to start, I'm going to earn my net,\" said Lankinen, who started this season third on Chicago's depth chart. \"I do my best and go from there.\" Chicago's backup goalie is Malcolm Subban, who is 4-3-1 with a 3.04 GAA and a .907 save percentage. His last game was a 6-1 loss to the Dallas Stars on Tuesday. Blackhawks coach Jeremy Colliton said Lankinen's composure, athleticism, positioning and awareness have been impressive. \"I love how he carries himself,\" Colliton said. \"He's been really good for us.\" Florida's goaltending duties have been split between Sergei Bobrovsky (10-2-2, 3.01 GAA) and Chris Driedger (7-3-2, 2.40 GAA). Offensively, the Panthers are led in points by Jonathan Huberdeau (32 points, team-high 22 assists) and Aleksander Barkov (28 points, 19 assists). Patric Hornqvist leads the team with 11 goals. Defensemen Aaron Ekblad (nine goals, 10 assists) and Keith Yandle (three goals, 14 assists) have also been productive. For Chicago, Patrick Kane is having another big season with a team-high 40 points (11 goals, 29 assists). Named the league's MVP in 2016, Kane is again being hyped for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Alex DeBrincat, 23, leads the Blackhawks with 15 goals in 24 games. He scored 18 goals in 70 games last season after he had combined for 69 goals in his first two seasons in the league. Huberdeau, who has six assists and two goals during his current five-game points streak, will be a good test for Chicago's defense as the Blackhawks continue to chase the playoffs. Florida is in third place in the Central Division with 38 points, and Chicago is fourth with 33. That battle for postseason positioning -- the top four teams in each division qualify -- adds significance to the game, especially in a condensed schedule. \"We're in a playoff spot now,\" Vatrano said. \"We need to win, and we're doing that now.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "NEWCASTLE, England, March 12 (Reuters) - Under-fire Newcastle United manager Steve Bruce was impressed with the grit his side showed as they scored a stoppage-time equaliser to snatch a point in a 1-1 draw at home to Aston Villa in their battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League. Ciaran Clarke's own goal in the 86th minute had put Villa ahead but his central defensive partner Jamaal Lascelles headed home four minutes into added time to secure Newcastle's third draw in a row in the league, despite some poor performances. \"There are still 10 games to go. We're unbeaten in our last couple. We've got to show the same attitude and hopefully big players are back around the corner. That gives us something to focus on and I'm still convinced we'll be OK,\" said Bruce. \"There wasn't much in the game. Arguably we had the best chances but the goal they scored was a bit of a fluke. Then you have to show desire to get back into it and we did that. We at least deserved that,\" he told BT Sport. Bruce has been heavily criticised by Newcastle's fans for how his side have played this season, but he said his experience may be what the club needed to avoid the drop. The draw against Villa puts the Magpies two points above the drop zone. \"There is no question managing Newcastle is always difficult. There's a huge spotlight and that's the way it should be. I'm ready for the challenge and my experience I hope will prove vital,\" added Bruce. For Villa boss Dean Smith, it was a game he would like to forget in a hurry. \"When you're a goal up with four minutes to go you're disappointed naturally,\" he said. \"We didn't deserve to win the game. It wasn't a game for the purists, I thought it was a bit of an ugly game. They probably had the best chances but we should see it out.\" (Reporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Ken Ferris)",

        "title": "Prada CEO Bertelli's Cup quest spurred by Blake's advice",
        "full article": "Two decades after his startup Prada Challenge was swept out of the America\u00b4s Cup match by Team New Zealand, Italian billionaire Patrizio Bertelli continues to be motivated by the advice of the late Kiwi sailing champion Sir Peter Blake. Blake wrote the foreword for a book about Prada Challenge's 2000 campaign, encouraging the Italians to keep trying despite the crushing disappointment of that loss and the long odds of winning sailing\u00b4s marquee regatta. Bertelli took Blake\u00b4s words to heart. Four campaigns later, Bertelli\u00b4s team, now known as Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli Team, is back in the America\u00b4s Cup match. Luna Rosa Prada Pirelli Team and defending champion Emirates Team New Zealand are tied 2-2 after splitting races on the first two days of the best-of-13 series being sailed in fast, foiling 75-foot yachts on the Hauraki Gulf off Auckland. \"As Peter Blake wrote to us, in the America\u00b4s Cup you are not meant to give up; the America\u00b4s Cup is not for the faint-hearted,\" Bertelli said in an email from Italy. \"Winning the America\u00b4s Cup is almost impossible; almost, but not completely. It is this difficulty that makes any adventure worthwhile.\" Blake helped New Zealand win the America\u00b4s Cup for the first time, in 1995, and then managed the Kiwi team in 2000 when it beat Prada Challenge. He was killed by pirates while on an environmental exploration trip on the Amazon in December 2001. In the five campaigns under Bertelli, Luna Rossa has brought style, passion and determination to the America\u00b4s Cup. Bertelli is CEO of Prada. His wife, Miuccia Bianchi Prada, is the head designer at the fashion house.

The best-of-13 race series is scheduled to begin on Wednesday. (Andrew Cornaga/Photosport via AP)  Besides backing the sailing team - along with tire manufacturer Pirelli - Prada has put its imprint on the competition itself. Prada took over naming rights for the challenger series, which had been known for more than 30 years as the Louis Vuitton Cup, and is a presenting sponsor of the America\u00b4s Cup. Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli Team got stronger as the Prada Cup went on. It swept the New York Yacht Club\u00b4s American Magic in four races in the semifinal and then beat Sir Ben Ainslie\u00b4s INEOS Team UK 7-1 in the final. Afterward, its sailors drank Mumm Champagne out of the silver Prada Cup trophy. \"It is a great satisfaction both from the point of view of Luna Rossa and Prada,\" Bertelli said. \"Luna Rossa has allowed Italians, and not only, to experience the same joy and excitement as happened 2000, and in the same waters off Auckland.\" This version of Luna Rossa might be Italy\u00b4s best chance yet to hoist the Auld Mug for the first time in its 170-year history. Il Moro di Venezia lost the 1992 match 4-1 to America3. Prada Challenge, founded by Bertelli in 1997, lost 5-0 to Team New Zealand in 2000. Bertelli was the first Italian inducted into the America\u00b4s Cup Hall of Fame, achieving the honor in 2012 despite not having won the oldest trophy in international sports. Luna Rossa\u00b4s sailing team is led by two former America\u00b4s Cup champions. Co-helmsman Jimmy Spithill, an Australian, steered Oracle Team USA to victories in 2010 and 2013, the latter in a stunning comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand. Team director and skipper Max Sirena, who doesn\u00b4t sail on the stylish black boat, helped Oracle Team USA beat a Swiss team in 2010 in a one-off match that was the result of a bitter court fight. After Luna Rossa withdrew from the 2017 America\u00b4s Cup to protest a mid-cycle change in the size of the boats, Sirena became a technical director with Emirates Team New Zealand, which routed Spithill\u00b4s Oracle Team USA. Spithill, who also helmed Luna Rossa in the 2007 challenger trials, steers on starboard tack while Italian Francesco \"Checco\" Bruni steers on port tack. Finally winning the America\u00b4s Cup \"would be a reason of pride for all our fans and for Italy,\" Bertelli said. Luna Rossa has captured the attention of fans back home who have to rise early in the morning to watch racing on TV. \"Absolutely!\" Bertelli said. \"Live TV ratings have risen to incredible and unexpected levels, beating all forecasts, and interest is very high. The enthusiasm is reminiscent of 2000 and all of Italy has gathered around Luna Rossa. It is no longer an event limited to sailing enthusiasts and experts, but a true popular national phenomenon!\" Bertelli, 74, is a sailor as well as a businessman. \"My holidays are spent cruising with the family boat - but I have a lot of fun racing in the classic yacht championships,\" he said. ___ Follow Bernie Wilson on Twitter at http://twitter.com/berniewilson          Italy's Luna Rossa, left, sails against Team New Zealand in race 4 of the America's Cup on Auckland's Waitemata Harbour, Friday, March 12, 2021.

        "title": "A look at big settlements in US police killings",
        "full article": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The attorney for George Floyd's family said Friday that a $27 million settlement of a federal lawsuit by the city of Minneapolis is the largest pretrial civil rights settlement ever. The settlement was announced as jury selection continued in the trial of Derek Chauvin, a white former city police officer accused in the May 25 death of Floyd, who was Black. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump said the settlement \"sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end.\" Some settlements in police-involved deaths are kept private. Often a settlement includes money but specifies there was no admission of guilt. Some such lawsuits end up in court where a jury can award massive settlements that are whittled down on appeal. Here is a look at other high-profile cases of police-involved deaths of Black and brown people and the settlements: BREONNA TAYLOR          Cortez Rice, left, of Minneapolis, sits with others in the middle of Hennepin Avenue on Sunday, March 7, 2021, in Minneapolis, Minn., to mourn the death of George Floyd a day before jury selection is set to begin in the trial of former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged in Floyd's death. (Jerry Holt/Star Tribune via AP)  In September, the city of Louisville, Kentucky, agreed to pay Breonna Taylor's family $12 million and reform police practices. Taylor was shot to death by officers acting on a no-knock warrant. She and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were roused from bed by police. Walker said he fired once at the officers, thinking they were intruders. Investigators say police were returning fire when they shot Taylor several times. The settlement stipulated reforms on how warrants are handled by police. No officers have been charged in Taylor's death, but one officer faces criminal charges for bullets fired into another occupied apartment. Taylor's mother has filed complaints against the police, seeking an investigation into whether policies were violated in the investigation that led officers to her daughter's door. LAQUAN McDONALD Seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald was shot dead by Chicago police in 2014. Nothing in the city's recent history has created more distrust of City Hall and the police department than then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u00b4s unsuccessful legal battle to keep the dashcam video under wraps that shows Officer Jason Van Dyke shoot McDonald 16 times. A jury found Van Dyke guilty in October 2018 of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in McDonald\u00b4s shooting. He was sentenced to six years in prison. McDonald\u00b4s family sued for $16 million - a million for every bullet - but settled for $5 million. FREDDIE GRAY Six Baltimore officers were charged in the April 2015 arrest and in-custody death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man who died after being injured in a Baltimore police van, touching off weeks of protests. Three officers were acquitted and prosecutors dropped all remaining charges in July 2016 following a hung jury. The U.S. Department of Justice decided not to bring federal civil rights charges. Gray\u00b4s family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. PHILANDO CASTILE Jeronimo Yanez, an officer in St. Anthony, Minnesota, was acquitted of manslaughter in the 2016 fatal shooting of Philando Castile. The Black motorist had just informed the officer that he was carrying a gun. Yanez testified that Castile was pulling his gun out of his pocket despite his commands not to do so. The case in suburban St. Paul garnered immediate attention because Castile\u00b4s girlfriend streamed the aftermath live on Facebook. Castile\u00b4s mother reached a $3 million settlement and his girlfriend was paid $800,000 by the city of St. Anthony and others. TAMIR RICE Tamir Rice was 12 years old when he was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers\u00b4 cruiser skidded to a stop just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled the Rice family\u00b4s lawsuit for $6 million. AKAI GURLEY Rookie New York City police officer Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter in the November 2014 death of 28-year-old Akai Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn when a sound startled him and he fired accidentally. A bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. A judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years\u00b4 probation and 800 hours of community service. The city settled with Gurley\u00b4s family for $4.1 million. MICHAEL BROWN Michael Brown, an unarmed Black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department opted against civil rights charges. Wilson later resigned. The death of Brown led to months of sometimes violent protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement. His family received $1.5 million. ERIC GARNER Eric Garner, 43, died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict that officer, or any others involved in the arrest. The Justice Department declined to file civil rights charges after a yearslong investigation. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement.",

RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: LB Shaquem Griffin, DT Poona Ford, G Jordan Simmons. NEEDS: There seem to be an inordinate number of holes to fill for a Seattle front office that typically is not very active in the early wave of free agency, has salary cap concerns, and is lacking draft capital to replenish the roster with affordable options. The Seahawks' two most important decisions center on Wright and Carson and whether they can keep their linebacker group intact and bring back their top running back. Pass rush again became a priority after the decision to release DE Carlos Dunlap and save $14 million. Cornerback will become a need if both Dunbar and Griffin walk. Seattle could use a proven No. 3 wide receiver for the passing game. And then there are the wishes of QB Russell Wilson to be hit less and protected more, so don\u00b4t forget about the offensive line.

        "full article": "The Minnesota Timberwolves began the second half of the NBA season the same way they opened the first half -- with a win. Now they just have to avoid pretty much everything that happened after their initial success the first time around. The Timberwolves have a chance to create just their second winning streak of the season when they host the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday night in the opener of a two-day, two-game sequence. Minnesota tipped off the season with wins over Detroit and Utah before losing 29 of their next 34 games to finish the first half with the league's worst record at 7-29. Saddled with a nine-game losing streak at the All-Star break, the Timberwolves regrouped over the eight-day break and put together arguably their best effort of the season in a 135-105 shellacking of New Orleans on the road Thursday night. Third-string point guard Jaylen Nowell, who moved up a seat on the bench with second-termer Jordan McLaughlin out of action, bombed in six 3-pointers in seven attempts and 28 points in all in the Timberwolves' shocking performance against a Western Conference playoff contender. \"We just said, `Hey, get (the ball) up (the court), get us into our stuff, and then just be yourself afterward,' and then he caught fire,\" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said of Nowell. \"Fun to watch.\" Interestingly, Nowell's career-high scoring output came on the same night as fellow University of Washington alum Jaden McDaniels was pouring in a career-high of his own with 20 points for Minnesota. Throw in 27 points from rookie Anthony Edwards and the Timberwolves needed just 16 from star big man Karl-Anthony Towns to record a season-high in points, seven more than they'd scored in any previous game, 13 more than in any previous regulation contest. Minnesota was on the other end of an offensive onslaught the only previous time it faced the Trail Blazers this season. Damian Lillard had 39 points that early-January night, when Portland used a 47-point second quarter as a springboard to a 135-117 home win. One of the stars of the Team LeBron win at the All-Star Game on Sunday, Lillard went for 30 in Portland's second-half opener, a 127-121 home loss to Phoenix on Thursday. The Suns shot 59 percent overall and 54.2 percent on 3-pointers in the high-scoring win. \"We played a solid game,\" Lillard observed afterward, choosing to look at the bright side. \"But in stretches we allowed them to take over the game.\" The loss snapped a three-game winning streak. Now it's up to the Trail Blazers to avoid something that held them back in the first half -- losing streaks. Over their final 13 games of the first half, Portland had six- and three-game winning streaks. In between, they gave back more than half of their six-game run with a four-game losing skid. The Timberwolves beat the Trail Blazers 116-102 in their only meeting last season in Minneapolis. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "March 12 (Reuters) - Eighty-nine-year-old New Yorker Bob Holzman received his COVID-19 vaccine as soon as he could, hoping it would allow him to get back to his favorite activity - dancing. Over the last 75 years, Holzman has danced his way around the city's events to the rhythms of swing, fox-trot, samba, and salsa. And until last year, he had never missed a Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night Swing opening and had been a fixture at city dance parties. When the pandemic struck in March of 2020, Holzman found himself stuck at home. He occupied himself reading electronic books on loan from the New York Public Library and playing scrabble online with friends. But now he is looking forward to getting back to normality. \"It was a joke from, I think, probably Betty Davis, she says, 'Old age is not for sissies,'\" said Holzman, sitting on a wooden chair in the shadow of a large umbrella spread in Bryant Park. \"I consider myself lucky and fortunate that I'm still able to dance and jump around and take my shopping cart and do everything else.\" Across the United States, COVID-19 vaccinations have changed seniors' daily lives in ways large and small a year after the pandemic drove many in the high-risk group into forced isolation. Older Americans are again visiting family members, eating at their favorite restaurants, and shopping in stores without fear of death or hospitalization. \"I have no doubt ... that I'll be able to do whatever I did before,\" Holzman said. \"And I'll do it with a sense of gratitude that, you know, I was able to get through it.\" (Reporting by Aleksandra Michalska; editing by Diane Craft and Rosalba O'Brien)",

        "full article": "CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) - Lawmakers in Wyoming, where gay college student Matthew Shepard was killed more than 20 years ago, again decided not to adopt a hate crimes law. Wyoming is one of just three states that haven't enacted hate crimes legislation since Shepard was beaten and left for dead in Laramie in 1998. The killing of the University of Wyoming student inspired those laws in other states and at the federal level. A measure tabled Thursday by the Wyoming House Judiciary Committee would have allowed prosecutors to consider a criminal's biases against race, sex, gender, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, ethnicity or disabilities when seeking punishment for crimes. The legislation sponsored by Republican Rep. Pat Sweeney of Casper also would have provided for anti-bias training for law enforcement officers to help them identify and respond to hate crimes. Most public testimony Thursday was in support of the bill, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Others said the bill went too far or not far enough to discourage hate crimes. Arkansas and South Carolina are considering hate crimes legislation this year, though lawmakers removed protections for gay or transgender people from the South Carolina bill Thursday.

The result leaves struggling Newcastle in 16th place on 28 points from 28 games, two points above the relegation zone. Villa are ninth on 41 points from 27 matches. In a fairly pedestrian encounter, Newcastle's attacks were limited to firing aimless balls into the box that were easily dealt with by the Villa rearguard, leaving the north-east club's record signing Joelinton without any supply to work with. Luckily for the Magpies the visitors were equally poor, barely managing to threaten at all in a dull game that only burst into life in the final 10 minutes. Newcastle substitute Jacob Murphy came off the bench to replace Ryan Fraser in the 79th, and four minutes later he cut onto his right foot and smacked a shot off the crossbar. It was to prove a costly miss as Villa striker Ollie Watkins latched onto a Matt Targett cross three minutes later and his header deflected off Clarke into the net. Knowing defeat would leave them perilously close to sliding into the relegation zone, Newcastle poured forward in search of an equaliser. Their persistence was rewarded when Lascelles popped up to head home Murphy's cross at the near post in the fourth minute of stoppage time to grab a valuable point for his side. \"Over the course of the game, I wouldn't say it was a fair result - I thought we were the better team, I thought we had the better chances,\" Lascelles told BT Sport. \"We've got a really tight group (of players) and we all want to succeed. I think the performances have been a lot better compared to the start of the season,\" he added. (Reporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Ken Ferris)",

        "title": "Wolves set to allow Raul Jimenez to train with Mexico as he steps up recovery",
        "full article": "Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo is prepared to let Raul Jimenez train with the Mexico team during the international break later this month as the striker continues his recovery from a fractured skull. Nuno has already tipped Jimenez to return to action before the end of the season from an injury he suffered in a sickening clash of heads with Arsenal defender David Luiz in Wolves\u2019 win at the Emirates Stadium in November. He has recently started training with his team-mates and, while he is not yet a full participant or heading the ball, he is taking precautions to guard against a setback by wearing a protective headband in the Wolves drills. The club are holding talks with Mexico about the prospect of Jimenez joining them ahead of their game against Wales in Cardiff on March 27, although Nuno warned all parties must be on the same wavelength before anything is agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking with them \u2013 the doctors and everybody and have already spoken with Raul about that,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cHe feels comfortable and I actually believe that will be good. But we have to make it work, not with mistakes. \u201cI think it will be good for him to join the Mexico squad to see his friends because it\u2019s a big part of his life, the many friends he has are there so it will be good for him.          Raul Jimenez has scored 27 goals in 86 appearances for Mexico (Tim Keeton/PA)  \u201cWe are just trying to figure out the best way to do that. We are taking these steps with Raul very carefully, but always with the intention to bring him back in the best way possible.\u201d No decision has yet been taken about whether Jimenez \u2013 who has scored 27 times in 86 appearances for Mexico \u2013 will wear his headgear when he is ready to make his comeback. Petr Cech is the most obvious example of a player donning protective equipment following a head injury, but Nuno revealed Jimenez\u2019s guard is more sophisticated than the one the former Chelsea goalkeeper used in his career. \u201cIt\u2019s much more advanced, it\u2019s amazing what technology does,\u201d added Nuno, whose Wolves side welcome Liverpool to Molineux in the Premier League on Monday evening. \u201cHe feels comfortable in it, he\u2019s able to do almost every action. We are on to the next step. \u201cLet\u2019s see if it\u2019s able to be applied in the competition. That\u2019s the only goal that the gear has \u2013 to be useful in the preparation and the competition. \u201cBut with Raul there are still a lot of question marks and a lot of boxes we have to tick.\u201d Jimenez bagged 27 goals in all competitions for Wolves last season and amassed seven in 15 appearances for club and country during this campaign before his accidental collision with Luiz. According to Nuno, the 29-year-old\u2019s outlook on his injury and his subsequent comeback to training has improved the mood at the club. \u201cIt\u2019s a big lift because he\u2019s a fantastic boy,\u201d added Nuno. \u201cWith the serious situation he\u2019s faced and the doubts, it was clear that he never doubted, he was always positive, he\u2019s always with a smile, he\u2019s always engaged to do things. \u201cThat, by itself, is a big, big lift when you see someone with something so serious and he\u2019s so positive about it all. Raul is amazing.\u201d",

        "title": "Tosin Adarabioyo can aim for England squad says Fulham boss Scott Parker",
        "full article": "Fulham manager Scott Parker believes former Manchester City player Tosin Adarabioyo can aim for the England squad as he prepares to face his former club. Adarabioyo joined the Citizens aged five, but found senior appearances limited under Pep Guardiola during his time there, and spent two seasons on loan in the Championship with West Brom and Blackburn. Parker then signed Adarabioyo in the summer transfer window, and has previously admitted he had an eye on the 23-year-old defender from his time with the Tottenham under-23s. \u201cThat (England national team) can be a goal for Tosin,\u201d Parker said when asked about his future. \u201cI still think there are elements where he can improve for sure. I see that every day.\u201d City are arguably closing in on the title and their 21-game winning streak was only brought to an end by derby rivals Manchester United at the weekend, while Fulham currently sit in the relegation zone, but level on points with Brighton in 17th place and just one behind Newcastle.          Fulham manager Scott Parker believes Tosin Adarabioyo can aim for the England squad (Paul Ellis/PA)  Adarabioyo has been a crucial part of Fulham\u2019s defensive improvements this season, after they conceded 10 goals in their opening three matches, before the 23-year-old\u2019s arrival in October. Alongside stand-in captain and loanee Joachim Andersen, Adarabioyo has become a mainstay of the Fulham defence, which has shipped just two goals in their last eight matches and Parker believes he can see the City influence in the 23-year-old. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that (City influence). I saw him at Blackburn last year, I saw him play for the under-23s at City, his biggest attribute was certainly with the ball. \u201cWhere I think he has improved drastically is without it. Defensively doing his work. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say defensively he wasn\u2019t top, but certainly, I think I knew when we were bringing him in that he is a player that has been brought up and schooled as a ball-playing centre-half. \u201cWhen we brought him in, first of all, he needed to realise that he is going to be defending a lot at times in our team, compared to a City or a top side.\u00a0 For defenders, sometimes that\u2019s a big transition. That\u2019s sometimes hard. \u201cYou need to have that instinct for defending really. I think over the course of this season, he is defending the box much better, with headers. I think he has improved drastically in that element. What you see on the ball is a player that is a top, top player.\u201d",

        "full article": "David Moyes believes Jesse Lingard will want to stay at West Ham after his loan deal ends. Lingard has been in outstanding form since moving on a temporary deal from Manchester United in January. The 28-year-old England international has four goals and two assists to his name in six Premier League matches for the Hammers. Lingard\u2019s future prospects at Old Trafford look bleak, even though manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he expects the winger to return to the club. But Moyes hopes West Ham\u2019s climb up to fifth in the Premier League makes them an attractive proposition. \u201cI hope we\u2019re going to be in a position to attract many players in the future, because of our league position, because we\u2019re a club with stature, we\u2019re in London, we have a 60,000-plus stadium which will be full every week. I think all those things go in our favour,\u201d said the Hammers boss.          Jesse Lingard is enjoying his loan spell at West Ham (Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA)  \u201cJesse wanted to come here, right from the start. When I was talking to him he wanted to come to West Ham. He saw it as a really good place for him. I think he\u2019ll have seen what we\u2019re trying to do. \u201cHe\u2019s joined a good group of players as well. We\u2019ve got international players and I\u2019m hoping we can add to that in the coming transfer window.\u00a0 The job is to try to add to that. \u201cBut I would hope Jesse sees this as a good place if it\u2019s possible to be done, and if we think that we want to do it at the end of the season.\u201d West Ham travel to Old Trafford on Sunday without Lingard, due to the terms of his loan deal.",

        "full article": "Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown would be \u201csurprised\u201d if the club offer a new deal to David Luiz even though he has been impressed by the Brazilian of late. Luiz has often polarised supporter opinions and has been prone to making mistakes due to lapses in concentration. But the 33-year-old has become a key part of Mikel Arteta\u2019s side of late and is likely to start Sunday\u2019s north London derby against Tottenham. Keown, who won three Premier League titles at Arsenal, spoke against the signing of Luiz from Chelsea in 2019 and \u2013 despite being won over to some extent \u2013 believes the club should return to the transfer market in the summer to land another defender. \u201cWhen he came I said it was the wrong signing,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t wait for six months or a year, I just felt it wasn\u2019t the direction I would have gone in. \u201cI was looking at it from a defensive point of view, as what I\u2019m looking for as a priority for a top defender in a one-v-one situation. \u201cDavid Luiz has surprised me with how well he has done but he needs to be in a back-five. He plays his best football in a five and at the moment we are playing in a four so there is always that vulnerability. \u201cFor that reason I would like to go in a different direction \u2013 we will see what happens in the summer, they should be looking at strengthening, they have got to be.\u201d Luiz is out of contract in the summer having signed a one-year extension in 2020. It has been rumoured talks will soon begin on another 12-month deal but Keown believes it may not be a good idea for club or player to do so. Speaking as an ambassador for the FA and McDonald\u2019s Grassroots Football Awards, Keown added: \u201cHaving not worked with him I don\u2019t know what type of personality he is, only the manager will know that. \u201cIf he feels he is a good influence and he can help the youngsters, because there are a lot of young players that we need to look after and give them the right set of ideals moving forward. \u201cWe are talking about someone who would think of the team before themselves if they weren\u2019t playing. I think David Luiz would want to play and I\u2019m sure he still has something to offer the game. \u201cWe all have opinions on defending and his style is not something I am a massive fan of but he has surprised me with how well he has done. \u201cHe has done well in a physical sense in terms of heading and those types of things but I do feel he is vulnerable in one-v-one situations and we have seen that \u2013 so I would be surprised if he is kept on for another year.\u201d :: Arsenal legend Martin Keown is launching nominations for the 2021 FA & McDonald\u2019s Grassroots Football Awards.

Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000.\u00a0But what causes it and how can it be treated?What is breast cancer?Breast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts.When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an 'invasive' breast cancer. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule.Most cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rare.Staging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body.The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast growing.\u00a0High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated.What causes breast cancer?A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'.Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer, such as genetics.What are the symptoms of breast cancer?The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign.\u00a0The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit.How is breast cancer diagnosed?Initial assessment: A doctor examines the breasts and armpits. They may do tests such as a mammography, a special x-ray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumours.Biopsy: A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells. The sample can confirm or rule out cancer.If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest x-ray.         How is breast cancer treated?Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used.Surgery: Breast-conserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumour.Radiotherapy: A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focussed on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops cancer cells from multiplying. It is mainly used in addition to surgery.Chemotherapy: A treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells, or stop them from multiplyingHormone treatments: Some types of breast cancer are affected by the 'female' hormone oestrogen, which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply. Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones, or prevent them from working, are commonly used in people with breast cancer.How successful is treatment?The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure.The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.For more information visit breastcancercare.org.uk, breastcancernow.org or www.cancerhelp.org.uk Advertisement",

        "title": "Thomas Partey was not rushed back from injury, insists Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta",
        "full article": "Mikel Arteta insists Thomas Partey was not rushed back from injury earlier in the season and believes Arsenal will soon see the best of the summer signing. Partey joined from Atletico Madrid on transfer deadline day in October after the Gunners triggered his release clause. The Ghana international has struggled with injuries since moving to north London and Arteta\u2019s side are languishing in 10th place in the Premier League \u2013 12 points off the top four \u2013 ahead of Sunday\u2019s derby clash at home to Tottenham. Partey has started just 12 games, one of which was the 2-0 loss at Spurs in December. That was his first game back from injury and he lasted just 47 minutes before limping off and missing the next month, with Arteta continuing to defend the decision to play Partey in that game. Asked if it had been a mistake to bring Partey back so quickly, Arteta replied: \u201cNo, because he ticked every box to be able to play in that game. \u201cAfter every injury there is a risk for a period, whether it is five days, a week, two weeks or three weeks depending on the load that the player is exposed to. \u201cBut it was a really specific action where he just overstretched the area going to the floor and got his foot trapped and then he felt it again. Before the game you cannot know that would have been the way. \u201cIt would be easy to say, \u2018Yes, we made a mistake\u2019, but who would have known if he had played the next game or if he had come off the bench and played 30 minutes instead?\u201d Partey spoke to the media ahead of Arsenal\u2019s 3-1 Europa League victory over Olympiacos on Thursday and said he felt the club\u2019s fans had not seen the best of him due to his fitness issues. Arteta agreed with his midfielder, but feels it will not be long before Partey is up to speed. \u201cI think so,\u201d he replied when asked if Partey was close to his best. \u201cRhythm-wise he has struggled a little bit in the last few weeks because he hasn\u2019t had enough training sessions or enough preparation because the league is so demanding. \u201cBut you can see his quality, you can see the presence and the special qualities he provides to the team when he is on the pitch. \u201cI think it is just a fact of playing more games, getting some chemistry and understanding with his team-mates and getting as fit as he possibly can.\u201d",

Kane bagged his 25th and 26th goals of the season in Thursday\u2019s 2-0 Europa League win over Dinamo Zagreb while he has also added 16 assists in all competitions. And with another game that he usually excels in \u2013 the north London derby \u2013 coming up on Sunday, Davies has hailed his team-mate\u2019s impact. \u201cHe\u2019s huge.

Harry Kane has scored 26 goals for Spurs this season and Ben Davies has called him inspirational (Neil Hall/PA)  \u201cOn the training pitch, we see his quality in so many games and it\u2019s hard to say he\u2019s taken a step up because he\u2019s so good anyway. If he keeps up this form then it\u2019s going to be another amazing season for him.\u201d Spurs go to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday knowing a victory would move them 10 points clear of Arsenal, which would surely lock in a fifth successive season of finishing above them in the league.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Tottenham Hotspur (@spursofficial)  Davies is not focusing on that, though, and is focusing on making it four league wins on the bounce. \u201cWe don\u2019t really get dragged too much into that as a squad because we focus on ourselves and hopefully that result of finishing better than them is as a consequence of us doing well,\u201d he said. \u201cOur aim this year is to win a trophy and to finish as high as we can. \u201cOf course it\u2019s always a big moment when we beat them because football is about rivalry and the passion that comes with it and if we beat them then it\u2019s all the better.\u201d",

        "full article": "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has expressed concerns about the state of the pitch at the Etihad Stadium. City seem to have had few problems playing at home this season given they are 14 points clear at the top of the Premier League and chasing an unprecedented quadruple. Guardiola, however, fears the surface is starting to show signs of wear and tear ahead of the most critical phase of the campaign and even fears injuries if it worsens. Guardiola: The grass at the Etihad is not good #MCFC pic.twitter.com/2lmpFwDq0X\u2014 Andy Hampson (@andyhampson) March 12, 2021   Asked how much of a problem this was, Guardiola said at a press conference: \u201cA lot. They (the groundstaff) are working a lot, we are trying to find a solution, but the grass is not good. \u201cI know the weather conditions here in England are tough, but there are stadiums where the grass is good. \u201cWe were in London against Arsenal, we were in Anfield, Old Trafford and the grass was better than ours. \u201cWe were in Budapest in the Champions League and the grass was incredible, a red carpet. It was amazing and our grass still isn\u2019t good. And we need it.\u201d City relaid the pitch last spring during the coronavirus-enforced shutdown, but plans for a first full rebuild from the foundations in a decade were shelved due to the uncertain length of that break and the shortened off-season. It is now hoped it will go ahead this summer. In the meantime, with a break in the ground\u2019s fixture schedule, the pitch was reseeded after Wednesday\u2019s game against Southampton. That was the 21st home match of the season and the fourth in the past fortnight. There was also a run of four games in the space of 10 days in January. City now do not have another home fixture this month.\u00a0They are away at Fulham on Saturday and Tuesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 second leg against Borussia Monchengladbach has been switched to Budapest because of Covid-19 restrictions. They then travel to Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals before the international break. Guardiola feels a better pitch would produce better football, while, on a more serious note, he fears injuries if it deteriorates further. He said: \u201cI am not a greenkeeper. Maybe the quality of football is good enough and has destroyed the grass. I don\u2019t know. \u201cWe have to try to find a way that, (for) as much time as possible from October/November until March, the grass can be better, as good as possible. \u201cWe need it to avoid injuries, for our football to be better, for many reasons. I\u2019m pretty sure the club, like it always has done and always does, will do the best to find a solution.\u201d Guardiola\u2019s immediate concern is combatting a Fulham side who are building momentum as they battle to avoid relegation. Scott Parker\u2019s side have lost just one of their last seven games to give themselves a strong chance of escaping the bottom three. Guardiola said: \u201cI was really impressed when they played here in terms of their physicality, their ideas, their courage, defensive organisation, pace up front. \u201cTheir stadium is always difficult. The grass is not in good condition \u2013 quite similar to ours. A real tough opponent. Even in the games they didn\u2019t have success they created more chances. \u201cThe way they play is always positive. It\u2019s a big challenge for us.\u201d Guardiola sees former England midfielder Parker, 40, as one of a bright crop of new managers. He said: \u201cIn English football there are some incredibly good managers with Mr (Graham) Potter from Brighton and with Scott at Fulham. \u201cThis is my fifth season here in England and I never saw the teams from the mid-to-lower table with quality of such a high standard. \u201cMany of them have courage to play. They do this in the beginning and, even if it is not going well, they continue to do it. I\u2019ve a feeling the new generation of managers have this quality. \u201cAt the end the results come. That\u2019s what I admire the most.\u201d One area Guardiola feels he may have met his match in Parker is in the fashion stakes. Guardiola is well known for his sartorial choices, but the coat Parker wore for last week\u2019s win at Liverpool attracted plenty of attention. \u201cHe\u2019s younger, he has hair,\u201d Guardiola joked. \u201cHe\u2019s better than me, definitely. I accept a draw against him!\u201d",

He went on the league's COVID-19 protocol list on Thursday. \"People have to keep in mind that list doesn't necessarily mean you have COVID and you're out for two weeks,\" Golden Knights coach Peter DeBoer said Friday. \"There's been a number of false positives out there. ... We're working through that process right now.\" With fellow goalie Robin Lehner injured, Fleury has started 13 of the past 14 games for the Golden Knights, who lead the West division with 33 points. The Blues are one point back, although they have played three more games than the Knights. The veteran Lehner is doing a conditioning stint with the Henderson Silver Knights of the AHL, which leaves the Knights in a tight spot at goalie. Fleury, in his 17th season, has a 12-5-0 record on the season with a 1.73 goals-against average and a .938 save percentage with four shutouts. Logan Thompson, 24, made his NHL debut on Wednesday, relieving Fleury in the third period of a 4-3 loss to the Minnesota Wild. After being called up from the Henderson Silver Knights of the AHL, Thompson made two saves in 8:15 on the ice. He's expected to be backed up by Dylan Ferguson, a 22-year-old who appeared in one NHL game in 2017. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she has directed key Democratic lawmakers to begin working with Republicans on a major infrastructure package. Democrat Pelosi, who met on Thursday with the chairs of U.S. House of Representatives committees that will oversee the infrastructure package, said in a statement: \"Congress must work swiftly ... to craft a big, bold and transformational infrastructure package.\" A Pelosi aide told Reuters infrastructure is \"next in terms of top priorities.\" One big question mark remains how to pay for a massive boost in spending, which had prevented Congress from approving a big package for more than a decade. Pelosi said she hoped the measures will address transportation as well as \"other critical needs in energy and broadband, education and housing, water systems and other priorities.\" As a candidate, President Joe Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion in fixing highways, bridges and airports; building climate-resilient homes; wiring cities for broadband internet; and encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio told Reuters on Wednesday his \"tentative timeline\" is to have his committee's portion of a major infrastructure bill approved by the panel in May. \"It is going to be green and it is going to be big,\" he said.

        "full article": "By Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. lawmakers said on Friday they will begin working within weeks on legislation to overhaul authorizations for the use of military force that presidents from both parties have used to justify decades of attacks on overseas targets. Representative Gregory Meeks said the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, which he chairs, would begin debating the repeal of an Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that allowed the 2002 war in Iraq. \"I intend to mark up legislation in the Foreign Affairs Committee in the coming weeks to repeal it,\" Meeks told a video news conference with a group of fellow Democrats. Senators have also been pushing to shift back the authority to declare war to Congress from the White House. In the wake of airstrikes on Syria ordered by President Joe Biden, a bipartisan group on March 3 introduced legislation to repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF as well as one passed in 1991. The Democratic-led House voted to repeal the 2002 AUMF last year, but the measure was never taken up by the Senate, which was led then by Republicans. The Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress, not the president. That authority shifted after Congress passed AUMFs that did not expire - the Iraq measures as well as one that justified the fight against al Qaeda in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Representative Barbara Lee told the news conference that the AUMFs have been used more than 40 times to justify attacks in 19 countries. \"It's time we end these forever wars,\" Lee said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said any new authorization should have an end date, apply to specific countries and require consultation with and reporting to Congress. The White House said last week that Biden believes the AUMFs should be re-examined. (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)",

It has been something to look forward to.\u2018You need a target. That was a lot of the reason I did not contemplate selling him. Maybe in different circumstances I might have done that.\u2018But I am very good at buying and useless at selling.

The prestigious meeting is one of the biggest events in the horseracing calendarMartin and Simpson have had horses in training with a clutch of trainers, including Long Distance Hurdle winner Beer Goggles with the late Richard Woollacott, and still have one in training with Charlie Longsdon.But after doing the groundwork on many of them before they went back to other trainers, Martin, who trains this season\u2019s Welsh National runner-up The Two Amigos, decided on a change of policy.She said: \u2018I started thinking, \u201cMaybe I should be doing it myself\u201d. This is an amazing place to train horses.\u2018I have a mile gallop and all that lovely moor.

        "full article": "BRASILIA, March 12 (Reuters) - Brazil reported 2,216 COVID-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the third day in a row that fatalities exceeded 2,000 in the worst run of deaths since the pandemic began a year ago. The health ministry also reported 85,663 new coronavirus infections, its second highest number for one day, as the pandemic surges in South American country driven by a highly contagious new local variant. The World Health Organization said the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil is very concerning and serious action needs to be taken. Brazil has now registered 11,363,380 cases in all, passing India as the country with the second worst outbreak. The official death toll has risen to 275,105 in the world's second-deadliest outbreak outside the United States. On Wednesday, Brazil had a record toll of 2,286 dead, followed on Thursday by 2,233 more deaths, the health ministry said. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has minimized the gravity of the virus and said he will not have a vaccination, is facing mounting criticism for failing to secure a timely supply of doses for the populace, with less than 3% vaccinated so far. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that everyone in Brazil should take the situation seriously, adding that neighboring countries could be affected. \"Unless serious measures are taken the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths,\" he said at a news conference in Geneva.

        "title": "Auto industry urges emissions deal weaker than Obama's",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - A coalition of automakers has told the Biden administration it would agree to raise mileage standards to reduce tailpipe emissions but with tradeoffs and at rates lower than those brokered by California with five other car manufacturers. If agreed to, the proposal could give President Joe Biden a quick win by securing cuts in greenhouse gas emissions rather than waiting months, if not years, to legally undo a giant rollback approved when Donald Trump was president. But environmental groups say the proposal doesn\u00b4t go far enough to ward off the damaging effects of climate change and automakers are rejecting tougher Obama-era standards that they have the technology to meet. It also could result in two different sets of standards, one for California and the states that follow its rules, and another for the rest of the country. This could drive up vehicle prices. Asked Friday about the proposal, the White House said discussions with the auto industry on a fuel emissions standard were still early. It declined to comment on whether the administration would accept an agreement that falls below the California deal or Obama-era standards, stressing that tough requirements would be needed to get popular and less-efficient SUVs off the road. Under the plan, automakers would agree to stricter standards in exchange for a \"multiplier\" that would give them additional credit toward meeting the standards if they sell more electric vehicles, three people with knowledge of the talks said. The deal would incentivize automakers to get more electric vehicles on the road, thereby reducing pollution, said the people, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to reveal internal negotiations.          The 2022 Bolt EV, foreground, and EUV are displayed, Thursday, Feb. 11, 2021, in Milford, Mich. Whether people want them or not, automakers are rolling out multiple new electric vehicle models as the auto industry responds to stricter pollution regulations worldwide and calls to reduce emissions to fight climate change. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)  The proposal would raise mileage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at a rate between Trump\u00b4s rollback and standards brokered by California in a 2019 agreement with five automakers - Ford, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo - that is now followed by 13 states. Most other automakers, including General Motors, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) backed Trump\u00b4s rollback. They're among the automakers putting forward the new proposal. The companies had no official comment. The Trump rollback increased mileage requirements by 1.5% per year from the 2021 through 2026 model years. The California deal has 3.7% annual increases, while the Obama standards were about 5% annually. Under the Obama-era standards, automakers got double credit for fully electric vehicles toward meeting their fuel economy and pollution requirements. That \"multiplier\" was removed in the Trump rollback. The Trump administration had blocked California\u00b4s legal authority to set its own standards under the Clean Air Act. The Biden administration is expected to take steps next month to undo that with a rule that environmental groups hope will pressure automakers to agree to higher standards. A spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, which regulates pollution, wouldn\u00b4t comment on the automakers' proposal but said the agency \"continues to advocate for the most rigorous vehicle standards possible.\" Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee who has met with Biden over efficiency and vehicle emission standards, has said the California agreement is a useful starting point that he believes all automakers should join as the two sides negotiate longer-term standards to go beyond model year 2026 to fulfill the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Following the roadmap of GM\u00b4s recently announced goal of making all passenger vehicles electric by 2035, the coalition of automakers is pledging efforts to increase production of electric vehicles and hybrids, the people said. Automakers argue that it\u00b4s difficult to reach stricter standards because of continuing consumer demand for less-efficient SUVs and trucks, the top-selling vehicles in the country. By promoting more sales of zero-emission electric vehicles, which accounted for less than 2% of U.S. new vehicle sales last year, the United States can achieve greater emissions reductions down the road. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department is overseeing a rewrite of Trump anti-pollution rules along with the Environmental Protection Agency, has signaled openness to granting industry more credits for EV development. The automakers\u00b4 proposal is being presented in hopes of having a preliminary deal by Earth Day, April 22, when the administration is expected to release broader emissions targets at a U.S.-hosted climate summit. It highlights the obstacles ahead for Biden, who during the campaign promised \"ambitious\" fuel economy standards that also support job creation. Transportation emissions is the single biggest U.S. contributor to climate change. The Alliance for Auto Innovation, a large industry trade group, deferred to a February statement saying it wants to work with the administration on making fuel economy improvements soon, while strengthening the economy and benefitting consumers. The Trump rollback of the Obama-era standards would require a projected 29 miles per gallon in \"real world\" stop and start driving by 2026. That's well below the requirements of the Obama administration rules that would have increased it to 37 mpg. The California deal with Ford and the other automakers has vehicles getting about 33 mpg on average, according to environmental groups, after accounting for credits for electric vehicles. Biden has said he would forcefully address climate change by returning to the Obama-era standards. \"When the previous administration reversed the Obama-Biden vehicle standard and picked Big Oil companies over American workers, the Biden-Harris administration will not only bring those standards back, we\u00b4ll set new, ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet,\" Biden said in late January. Biden also has made boosting electric vehicles a top priority. He has pledged billions of dollars as part of an upcoming infrastructure and climate spending package to build 550,000 charging stations over the next decade to support such vehicles. In a letter to the White House late last month, two dozen environmental and green-friendly groups including the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council urged acceptance of nothing less than the Obama standards as part of a longer-term path to make all new cars and light-duty trucks zero-emission by 2035. They described credits granted to automakers for electric vehicles as \"loopholes\" that do little to reduce emissions in the short term. \"Not only are the automakers rejecting standards they agreed to 10 years ago, they are even refusing a weaker deal that five carmakers cut with California,\" said Dan Becker, a director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \"The administration should follow the science. We need to have much stronger national rules so we\u00b4re not guilty of looking global warming in the eye and blinking.\" ___ Krisher reported from Detroit.

NEEDS: The Bears need to figure out who their starting quarterback will be and resolve what could be a messy situation with Robinson after placing the franchise tag on their star receiver. They seemed to make clear their feelings about Trubisky prior to last season when they acquired Nick Foles from Jacksonville and declined their fifth-year option for 2021 on their once-prized QB. Even so, general manager Ryan Pace wouldn't rule out anything last week. Trubisky was benched in Week 3 and didn't return to the lineup until late November. Foles, the Bears' only quarterback under contract for next season, struggled. Robinson, meanwhile, is coming off one of his best seasons. He caught a career-high 102 passes. And his 1,250 yards were second only to the 1,400 he had with Jacksonville in his 2015 Pro Bowl season. The sides have until July 15 to reach a multi-year deal.

        "full article": "NORTH POINT, Antigua (AP) - A 192-run opening stand between Evin Lewis and Shai Hope and cool finishing by Nicholas Pooran steered the West Indies to a five-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second one-day cricket international on Friday. The West Indies also earned a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Lewis made 103 and Hope 84 to set the strong foundation that allowed the West Indies to overtake Sri Lanka\u00b4s 273-8 with two balls to spare. A middle order slump which saw the home side slip to 233-4 when captain Kieron Pollard was out in the 46th over put late pressure on the West Indies. But Pooran made an unbeaten 35 from 38 balls to steer his team home in the final over in the West Indies\u00b4 highest successful ODI run chase against Sri Lanka. The West Indies came to the 48th over needing 31 runs from 18 balls. Fabian Allen hit a six from the first ball from Nuwan Pradeep to eat into the deficit but was out next ball, leaving the match still in the balance. Pooran hit a four from the next delivery to ease some of the pressure on the home side and the West Indies was in a stronger position when Pradeep\u00b4s over conceded 18 runs, leaving 13 runs to be scored from the last 12 balls. Dushmantha Chameera bowled a tight 49th over, conceding only four runs, and the West Indies came to the last over still needing nine runs to win. The first ball was a dot ball but Pooran went down on one knee to strike a superb cover drive for four from Pradeep's second ball, putting the West Indies five runs from victory. Pradeep bowled a full toss which Pooran sliced behind point for four, and another full toss which the batsman chipped into the leg side for the winning run. \"You could say (it was too close for comfort),\" Pollard said. \"But at the end of the day we take the win. The guys batted well. \"Evin scored a hundred and in the dressing room we asked him for a hundred. It was nice to see Pooran finishing off the game and it was a total team effort.\" Sri Lanka batted first after winning the toss and slumped to 50-3 in the ninth over. Danushka Gunathilaka\u00b4s luck turned and his 96 from 96 balls led Sri Lanka\u00b4s recovery. Gunathilaka seemed to have been wronged when he was given out for obstructing the field in the first ODI which the West Indies won by eight wickets. He batted superbly on Friday, re-establishing the Sri Lanka innings in a partnership of exactly 100 for the fourth wicket with Dinesh Chandimal, who made 71. A quick-fire innings of 47 from 31 balls by Winandu Hasaranga lifted Sri Lanka to a competitive total. \"In our batting, we lost a couple of wickets in the early part but we recovered,\" Sri Lanka captain Dinush Karunaratne said. \"Unfortunately those two batsmen who got runs today couldn\u00b4t go on to a big one.\" The final ODI is at the same venue on Sunday. ___ More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

Midfielder Mathieu Cafaro put mid-table Reims ahead in the 32nd minute when he neatly volleyed in a cross from the right. Kadewere earned his battling side a point when he rose superbly to nod in Memphis Depay's pinpoint cross from the left. Third-placed Lyon is level on points with second-placed Paris Saint-Germain but behind on goal difference, and two behind leader Lille. Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic saved well from Lyon midfielder Lucas Paqueta early in the second half, and Paqueta had a strong penalty claim dismissed after appearing to be tripped. As Lyon pushed forward, Depay had a low shot saved with 20 minutes left and Rajkovic reacted well to keep out a low effort from substitute Maxwell Cornet in the 82nd. After Depay's brilliant curling effort shaved the post in the 88th, he found his range for Kadewere's head.

        "full article": "Google had unusually harsh words for Microsoft, claiming its technology rival was \"willing to break the way the open web works\" by supporting mandatory payments to media organizations for news content  Google on Friday took aim at Microsoft, accusing its technology rival of \"distraction\" for siding with governments seeking to force tech platforms to pay media organizations for news content. In a blog post, Google argued that Microsoft was trying to divert attention from a potentially devastating attack on Exchange emails servers by hackers taking advantage of software vulnerabilities. The comments came amid a heated battle of words over efforts in Australia and elsewhere to require digital services to negotiate payments for news content. Google and Facebook have resisted mandatory payments, while Microsoft has taken a more collaborative stance. Microsoft president Brad Smith, in a letter to a congressional subcommittee hearing, blamed Google's business model for \"devouring\" ad revenue on which news groups rely. Google senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker fired back in the blog post, saying of Microsoft: \"They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.\" Walker added, \"This important debate should be about the substance of the issue, and not derailed by naked corporate opportunism.\" In his letter, Smith lauded the role news organizations play in defending democracy and contended that the \"internet gutted the already ailing local news business by devouring advertising revenue and luring away paid subscribers.\" Microsoft has lobbied for other countries to follow Australia's lead in calling for news outlets to be paid for stories published online, a move opposed by Facebook and Google. \"News today is part of the technology ecosystem, and all of us who participate in this ecosystem have both an opportunity and responsibility to help journalism flourish,\" Smith said. Backers of Google and Facebook have claimed that mandatory payments for news links would fundamentally change the way the internet works and ultimately be detrimental to free online services.",

        "full article": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The U.N. Security Council approved an increase of nearly 3,700 military and police to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Central African Republic on Friday to help reverse the deteriorating security situation in the conflict-torn nation where violence has increased since last December\u00b4s presidential election. A council resolution, adopted by a vote of 14-0 with Russia abstaining, will bring the ceiling for military personnel to 14,400 and for police to 3,020. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recommended the increase last month saying the Central African Republic, known as CAR, is at \"a critical juncture.\" The mineral-rich Central African Republic has faced deadly inter-religious and inter-communal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in the killing of thousands and the displacement of thousands. The country saw a period of relative peace in late 2015 and 2016, but violence intensified and spread afterward. A peace deal between the government and 14 rebel groups aimed at ending years of fighting was signed in February 2019. But violence blamed on CAR\u00b4s former president, Francois Bozize, and his allies threatens to nullify the agreement. It erupted after the constitutional court rejected Bozize\u00b4s candidacy to run for president in December. President Faustin Archange Touadera won re-election in late December to a second term with 53% of the vote, but he continues to face opposition from forces linked to Bozize that contend he failed to meet the \"good morality\" requirement for candidates.          Moroccan UN peacekeepers patrol Bangassou, Central African Republic, Sunday Feb. 14, 2021. An estimated 240,000 people have been displaced in the country since mid-December, according to U.N. relief workers, when rebels calling themselves the Coalition of Patriots for Change launched attacks, causing a humanitarian crisis in the already unstable nation. (AP Photo/Adrienne Surprenant)  The resolution adopted by the council expresses \"grave concern at the deterioration of the situation in the Central African Republic due to armed group attacks in advance of and following the election.\" It condemns violations of the peace agreement \"in the strongest terms\" and \"violence perpetrated by armed groups and other militias, including violence aiming at obstructing the electoral process, incitement to ethnic and religious hatred and violence, ... sexual and gender-based violence in conflict, as well as violence directed at civilians from specific communities, resulting in deaths, injuries and displacements.\" The resolution stresses that the reinforcements for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSCA, are aimed at enhancing its ability to perform its mandate, especially protecting civilians and facilitating access for the delivery of humanitarian aid, \"and at enabling the mission to enhance its capacity to prevent and reverse a further deterioration in the security situation while creating space for the political process to advance.\" The council welcomed president Touadera\u00b4s proposed roadmap for dialogue and called for \"concrete steps\" from the government and all political actors to engage in talks, resolve outstanding issues \"and conclude the electoral process through the organization of legislative and local elections.\" Campaigning for this weekend\u00b4s second round of legislative elections is scheduled to end Friday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. MINUSCA calls on all those involved to ensure voting is peaceful, \"to refrain from violence and resolve any disputes through peaceful means,\" he said.",

Lascelles powered home a last-gasp header to snatch a 1-1 draw at St James\u2019 Park just as it looked as though Ollie Watkins\u2019 86th-minute effort, which looped in off unfortunate former Villa defender Ciaran Clark, had plunged them deeper into the mire. Magpies head coach Steve Bruce might have been left bemoaning his luck had his captain not intervened after substitute Jacob Murphy had hit the bar minutes earlier and while his side have now won only twice in 19 games in all competitions, they sit two points clear of the drop zone with 10 fixtures to play. Newcastle score with the final attack of the match to claim a point#NEWAVL pic.twitter.com/LiM4kimbj9\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) March 12, 2021   On a night when he and opposite number Dean Smith might ordinarily have hoped the likes of Allan Saint-Maximin or Jack Grealish might have lit up the contest, it failed to ignite in their absence until the closing stages. Having handed Dwight Gayle just a second start of the campaign, Bruce sprang something of a surprise when he asked him to line up on the left hand side of a front three with Joelinton on the right and the diminutive Ryan Fraser in the middle. The Scotland international warmed up keeper Emiliano Martinez with a well-struck fifth-minute volley but as the visitors settled, it was they who set the tempo with Douglas Luiz and John McGinn conducting from the middle of the field. Tyrone Mings needed the assistance of central defensive partner Ezri Konsa after being sucked in by Joelinton as he cut inside as the Magpies staged a rare 14th-minute attack, but the visitors were dealt a blow seven minutes later when dangerous winger Bertrand Traore left the field after damaging his ribs when he collided with advertising hoardings behind Martin Dubravka\u2019s goal. Substitute Anwar El Ghazi announced his arrival within two minutes with a drive which nestled safely in Dubravka\u2019s midriff, but the Slovakia international keeper needed to be at his best to keep out Trezeguet\u2019s rising 28th-minute strike from a narrow angle. Newcastle gradually worked their way into the game, but without the necessary cutting edge to trouble Villa as a tepid first half drew to its inevitable goalless conclusion, and it was Matt Targett who put his own keeper Martinez under pressure with an all too firm 63rd-minute header from an Isaac Hayden cross. Joelinton, who troubled Mings throughout, should really have tested the keeper to the full with 18 minutes remaining when he was played in by Joe Willock but not for the first time, instead of smashing the ball towards goal, he attempted to pick out Fraser and saw his pass cut out. Murphy was denied by the crossbar with eight minutes left on the clock, and Newcastle\u2019s misery looked to be complete three minutes later when Watkins got his head to Targett\u2019s cross and saw the ball hit Clark and go in off the crossbar. However, Lascelles thumped home a header from Murphy\u2019s cross deep into stoppage time to snatch point which could prove priceless in the final analysis.",

The new guidance shows how badly the second coronavirus wave is affecting airlines in the region, especially in Brazil, which just this week posted a new record for daily deaths. Many countries have shut borders with Brazil while state governors in recent days have imposed ever tighter lockdowns to try to stop the spread. Domestic flights in Brazil are a key market for LATAM. Its main rival there, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes , said on Friday it was asking passengers with tickets booked for April to confirm whether they were actually going to take the flight, suggesting they were expecting significant cancellations. \"With the worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gol is adapting its flight schedules for the month of April,\" the airline said in a statement.\" (Reporting by Marcelo Rochabrun in Sao Paulo Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: K Daniel Carlson. NEEDS: The biggest holes on the Raiders are on the defensive side of the ball after allowing the third-most points in the NFL last season. Coach Jon Gruden has been looking for a top pass rusher ever since trading Khalil Mack two years ago, and the team could use help on the interior and the edge. The Raiders have used some high picks on the secondary the past two years but still need help there, especially at free safety and in the slot. Las Vegas also needs to bolster the offensive line after cutting guard Richie Incognito and trading tackle Trent Brown. Guard Gabe Jackson also could be a cap casualty. The Raiders also need either to bring back Agholor or sign another veteran receiver.

        "full article": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Seth Towns is a natural when it comes to staying poised. So when Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann needed an extra body to fill a key role Friday, he gave the Harvard transfer an opportunity. Towns took full advantage of it, scoring a season-high 12 points in 11 minutes and making the tiebreaking free throw to start overtime as the ninth-ranked Buckeyes beat No. 21 Purdue 87-78 in the Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals. Towns scored six points in OT, including a crucial 3-pointer with 2:53 left. \"Seth and I had a conversation last night and I just felt like he was going to play well tonight,\" Holtmann said after earning his 200th career victory. \"I just felt very confident in his mindset where his head was. It\u00b4s a great, great credit to him.\" The Buckeyes (20-8) may need their graduate transfer to come up big in Saturday's semifinal matchup against No. 4 Michigan, their longtime rival and the Big Ten regular-season champs, especially if Kyle Young is out.          Ohio State guard Duane Washington Jr. (4) follows through on a dunk against Purdue in the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Big Ten Conference tournament in Indianapolis, Friday, March 12, 2021. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)  Young matched his career with 18 points in the first half but most of the second half after taking an inadvertent elbow to the head. Young tried to play but eventually came out and did not return. Ohio State also finished the game without all-conference forward E.J. Liddell, who fouled out after scoring 17 points, grabbing five rebounds and dishing out five assists. Duane Washington Jr. led Ohio State with 20 points. For the Buckeyes, it was another harrowing close call. Just 24 hours after Minnesota cut a 14-point lead to one in the final 3 1/2 minutes of Thursday's tourney opener, they blew an 18-point halftime lead. Towns rescued them. \"Seth is always under control and calm,\" Liddell said, cracking a smile. \"I feel like Seth is always the level-headed one and he made the big plays, the big shots.\" It was a big moment, too. Ohio State had lost both of the other games against the Boilermakers (18-9) and the victory sends them to their first semifinal appearance since 2014. Trevion Williams finished with 26 points, 14 rebounds and five assists as Purdue's five-game winning streak ended. Jaden Ivey added 19 points. \"It was on us,\" Boilermakers forward Mason Gillis said when asked about the momentum shift in overtime. \"We missed a free throw box out, they get a layup, a runner and a 3 (from Towns) and that\u00b4s it right there.\" BIG PICTURE Ohio State: One day after snapping a four-game losing streak, the Buckeyes won another game in less than impressive fashion. Yes, they need to develop a stronger knockout punch to make a deep NCAA Tournament run. What they do have, however, is grit and depth. Purdue: One of the Big Ten's hottest teams was doomed by a miserable first half in Indy. It's only the second loss the Boilermakers have suffered inside Indiana this season. But now they'll get some extra rest before resuming next week in one of the three Indiana cities hosting tourney action this sesaon. STAT PACK Ohio State: Washington also had five rebounds and three assists. ... The victory also gives Holtmann his eighth consecutive 20-win season. The Buckeyes have won 20 in 16 of the last 17 seasons. ... Ohio State was 16 of 18 from the free throw line. ... The Buckeyes lost their only other matchup against Michigan 92-87 in Columbus on Feb. 21. ... Ohio State is now 3-0 all-time at Lucas Oil Stadium, which also hosts the Big Ten football title game. Purdue: Zach Edey scored 11 points for the Boilermakers. ... The Boilermakers never led in the second half and only tied the score twice, both on baskets from Williams. The first came with 46.5 seconds left and the second, with 9.4 seconds left, made it 72-all. ... The Boilermakers' streak of holding opponents to 72 or fewer points ended at 15. YOUNG UPDATE Holtmann did not provide an update on Young's status following the game because he said he hadn't yet talked to the doctors. But when asked about why Young played four more possessions before leaving the game for good, Holtmann he'd take a second look at how it unfolded. \"I\u00b4d like to look back and know the exact scenario,\" he said. \"I think initially he said he wanted to play and so we let him. Maybe looking back, I could have pulled him. Maybe I should have.\" UP NEXT Ohio State: Faces No. 4 Michigan in Saturday\u00b4s first semifinal. Purdue: Will wait to see who they play when the NCAA Tournament bracket comes out Sunday. ___ For more AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25          Purdue center Zach Edey (15) looks to pass between Ohio State forward Kyle Young (25) and forward E.J.

Thousands of barrels were discovered in the waters off Santa Catalina Islands last yearDeveloped as an insecticide, DDT became an effective way to limit the spread of typhus and malaria during World War II.After the war, it took off as both an agricultural and household pesticide.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Herpes and toxic chemicals are causing an aggressive cancer...    'Extraordinary' levels of toxic pollution from chemicals...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n In 1959 alone, nearly 80 million pounds of DDT were applied to US soil, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.But by the 1960s, environmentalists were pointing to it as a threat to both animal life and humans.         Banned in 1972, DDT has been linked to devastating effects on marine life and other animals.\u00a0As many as half a million barrels could still underwater, according to the Los Angeles TimesIn 1972, the EPA banned DDT in the US, classifying it as a probable human carcinogen.Almost a half-century later, in October 2020, thousands of barrels of DDT were discovered in the waters off Santa Catalina Island, The Los Angeles Times reported.Montrose Chemical Corp, once the leading manufacturer of DDT, was based in Los Angeles.\u00a0\u00a0Every month for almost 40 years, the company reportedly filled a ship with barrels of toxic waste, including DDT, and sunk it into the Pacific, the Times reported.As many as half a million of those barrels could still be thousands of feet underwater.'These barrels are full of toxic chemicals that could be causing illness among ocean wildlife and even humans,' Sen. California Senator Dianne Feinstein told the paper. 'Ignoring it or claiming it's just too difficult to deal with is not an option.'         Condensing two years' worth of planning into a few months, researchers with UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography set sail Wednesday for a two-week mission aboard the R/V Sally Ride (pictured)The first step was determining the scale of the problem, and research scientists came up with a unique solution: Two robots scanning almost 50,000 acres of the San Pedro Basin seafloor for these toxic tubs.'We want to provide a common base map of what's on the seabed at a high enough resolution,' Eric Terrill, a marine researcher with UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told the L.A. Times.\u00a0The sub-like\u00a0Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS)\u00a0can operate in waters ranging from 80 feet to about 20,000 feet, or 3.73 miles.\u00a0Terrill calls them 'underwater Roombas,' though instead of vacuums, they come equipped with sonar tech that\u00a0collects data from the ocean floor.\u00a0         Pictured: Marine researcher Eric Terrill prepares Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS). The robot subs come equipped with sonar tech that collects data from the ocean floorHe's previously used the technique to find downed WWII aircrafts.Each robot can run underwater for about 12 to 16 hours before it needs a recharge, a process that can take half a day.So while one is scanning the seafloor, the other is recharging and downloading its findings.Terrill had already been working with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on testing the robots, but the decision was made to skip the preliminaries and send them out on a mission.Condensing two years' worth of planning into a few months, they set sail Wednesday for a two-week mission aboard the R/V Sally Ride, an oceanographic research vessel owned by the Navy but on loan to Scripps.\u00a0\u00a0There's a sense of urgency: \u00a0DDT has been connected to cancer growth in sea lions, shorter lifespans in shrimp, and numerous other problems for marine life.It also led to a decline in bald eagles, peregrine falcons and other birds: The pesticide caused their eggshells to become too thin and to break open prematurely.According to the CDC. the health effects from DDT at low environmental doses 'are unknown.''The rediscovery of the massive DDT dumping ground off Southern California is certainly a disaster in need of context \u2014 how has the DDT, leaked from thousands of sunken barrels, made its way to the parts of the food chain that Californians rely on?' Brice Semmens, a marine biologist at Scripps told the Times.The data from the twin scanners will help authorities determine how large the problem is, and which areas are in most danger, but undoing decades' worth of environmental devastation will require its own solutions.Montrose Chemical shut down in 1982, a decade after the US banned DDT.Its former plant was declared a high-priority Superfund site in 1989, but is still awaiting clean up.According to the EPA, between the late 1950s and early 1970s, Montrose poured over 1,700 tons of DDT into the Pacific through its sewage system.",

        "title": "McConnell backs new process to fill Kentucky Senate vacancy",
        "full article": "FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - Mitch McConnell has given his blessing to legislation to change how a vacant U.S. Senate seat would be filled in his home state of Kentucky, but it most certainly doesn't signal an opening is contemplated, an ally of the Senate Republican leader said Friday. The bill was advanced by a Kentucky House committee, leaving it one step away from clearing the GOP-dominated legislature. The measure would remove the Democratic governor\u00b4s ability to make his own choice if a Senate seat opened up. Republicans hold both Senate seats from Kentucky and wield supermajorities in both legislative chambers, giving them the votes to override any veto. Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers, the bill's lead sponsor, acknowledged Friday that the bill had sparked questions about the 79-year-old McConnell, who won reelection last year. \"Let me make this definitive statement: He is not sick, he is not leaving -- maybe to some people\u00b4s chagrin -- but he plans to be there,\" Stivers told the committee. Stivers, the state Senate\u00b4s top leader, acknowledged that he discussed the bill ahead of time with McConnell, but neither has indicated who suggested the legislation. \"I asked him about this and said, `If I file this, people will question why am I filing this?\u00b4 Has nothing to do with anybody potentially leaving,\" Stivers said during the committee discussion.          FILE - In this Monday, Nov. 25, 2019 file photo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., right, speaks with Kentucky Governor-Elect Andy Beshear before the dedication of a Recovery Community Center in Manchester, Ky. Mitch McConnell has given his blessing to legislation to change how a vacant U.S. Senate seat would be filled in his home state of Kentucky, but it most certainly doesn't signal an opening is contemplated, an ally of the Senate Republican leader said Friday, March 12, 2021. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File)  McConnell, who previously endorsed the bill, said it would improve how a vacancy would be filled. \"It would also ensure Kentucky voters have the ability to choose who they think will best represent them in a timely manner, as opposed to leaving that decision to the governor, regardless of party,\" McConnell said in a statement Friday. When asked about the succession bill, Sen. Rand Paul's spokeswoman Kelsey Cooper said Friday that Kentucky's junior senator \"fully intends to serve out the remainder of this term and the next one, too.\" Paul is up for reelection in 2022. The legislation reflects the GOP\u00b4s commanding position in attempting to reset terms for senatorial succession if a vacancy occurred in the Bluegrass State. Any vacancy in the evenly split U.S. Senate would be of enormous consequence. Democrats have the slim edge in the 50-50 chamber because Vice President Kamala Harris is a tie-breaking vote. The Kentucky bill would put strict conditions on Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear in picking a temporary replacement if a vacancy occurred. The governor would have to choose from a three-name list provided by party leaders from the same party as the senator who formerly held the seat. With McConnell and Paul holding the seats, that means GOP leaders would submit the names. Stivers said the process would reflect the will of the state\u00b4s electorate. \"The people elected a Republican to be their representative in the United States Senate,\" he said. Kentucky law currently allows the governor to appoint someone to fill the seat until the next regular election of the U.S. House of Representatives - every two years. The bill would set up a process for a special election to fill the remainder of the unexpired Senate term. If the vacancy occurred more than three months before a regular election, any candidate able to collect enough signatures would compete in the special election, regardless of party affiliation. If no one received a majority of votes, a runoff would occur between the top two vote-getters. Beshear has criticized the bill, saying the process to fill a vacancy \"shouldn\u00b4t be decided based on who\u00b4s currently in the office.\" But Stivers says he would have supported putting the same constraints on the state's previous governor, Republican Matt Bevin. \"I\u00b4m not so sure I\u00b4d want the former governor having unfettered discretion to pick the replacement,\" the Senate president said. ___ The legislation is Senate Bill 228.",

        "full article": "In-person vigils paying tribute to Sarah Everard, which were due to be held in Edinburgh on Saturday, have been cancelled by organisers in favour of an online-only event. Events have been planned across the UK, including in Edinburgh and Glasgow, to pay tribute to Ms Everard, who disappeared while walking home in London and whose remains were found this week. However, Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman suggested women should find another way to pay tribute to the 33-year-old, warning any vigil in a public place would go against coronavirus restrictions. The Metropolitan Police also faced a legal challenge from organisers of a London event, with the force accused of doing an \u201cabout-face\u201d and declaring the vigil unlawful. Late on Friday night, Chloe Whyte, one of the Edinburgh organisers, said on Facebook: \u201cFollowing the decision of the High Court in London and comments from the Scottish Cabinet Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman MSP, the organisers of the #ReclaimTheseStreets Edinburgh vigils have decided to build upon events currently being hosted online and cancel all of our in-person gatherings. \u201cThe tragic story of Sarah Everard and the national outpouring it has provoked has shone a light on how just how many women have been made to feel unsafe on our streets due to sexual harassment and violence. This is a moment of reflection, but also one of action. \u201cPlease do NOT go to Holyrood or St Andrew\u2019s Square tomorrow, as sadly any gatherings there will be dispersed by police. \u201cWe are now building upon our \u2018doorstep vigil\u2019 activities, which shall include a stream of our speakers all sharing their stories from home & answering questions and comments live. More information to come on this. \u201cWhile this is incredibly frustrating, we deeply appreciate the platform that has been given to survivors of sexual harassment and violence this week.\u201d Ms Freeman said she herself would join commemorations if \u201cwe were in normal times\u201d, but added: \u201cWe are not in normal times. \u201cThe rules are there for a reason, they are there to protect all of us from a virus that doesn\u2019t play by the rules, that as soon as we come together looks to transmit itself from one person to another person and in doing that also is giving significant opportunity to mutate. \u201cI will take my private steps, I will light that candle on Saturday night, I will engage via social media to show my frustration, my anger, that women are still not safe on our streets, still not safe from male violence on our streets at any time of the day. \u201cI will not join a public vigil because that risks everyone from this virus. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying to all the women who are feeling angry, afraid, upset \u2013 I\u2019m right there with you, but please do not have a vigil. \u201cTake the steps that we ask people to do to show how you feel but not in a public gathering.\u201d Drawing on her own experience, Ms Freeman said: \u201cI\u2019m 67 years old. For 50 years as a woman I have lived a life that aims to protect and keep myself safe in a way that no man of my age ever has to do. \u201cI remember the Reclaim the Nights demonstrations\u2026 I was on those and if we weren\u2019t in the current situation we are now, then any public vigil I would certainly join.\u201d The Prime Minister has also urged people not to take to the streets, with Downing Street adding he \u201ccompletely understands the strength of feeling\u201d.",

He also had 14 rebounds while Jaden Ivey had 19 points. Ohio State has been unable to hold leads recently and the trend continued. They lost all but one of a 12-point lead in the final 1:38 vs. Minnesota on Thursday before prevailing 79-75. This time, Towns came off the bench to spark the Buckeyes in overtime. He had a 3-pointer and basket for an 80-76 lead, and when Washington drained a trey to make it 83-76 with 1:16 remaining, Ohio State regained control. After Eric Hunter made one of two free throws for Purdue, Washington made two free throws to extend the lead to 85-77 with 39 seconds left. After Purdue's Aaron Wheeler missed the second free throw, Walker scored on a breakaway for the final margin with 27 seconds left. Ohio State senior forward Kyle Young tied his career high with 18 points in just 19 minutes of action, but 2:56 into the second half he took an inadvertent elbow from Williams, left the game and did not return. Young made all four of his 3-point shots in the first half when the Buckeyes took a 49-31 halftime lead. The first half belonged to Young. He entered the game having made just nine 3-pointers all season but within the first six minutes had connected on three of them, and his 10 early points led Ohio State to a 13-10 advantage. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "Fourth-seeded Tennessee never trailed Friday in the Southeastern Conference quarterfinals, putting five players in double figures as it eliminated fifth-seeded Florida 78-66 in Nashville, Tenn. Santiago Vescovi scored 14 points for the Volunteers (18-7), who advance to a semifinal matchup Saturday with No. 6 Alabama. Jaden Springer and Keon Johnson each scored 13, while Yves Pons added 11 points and Josiah-Jordan James chipped in 10. Johnson and James also contributed nine rebounds and six assists each. Tre Mann kept the Gators (14-9) in contention by scoring 28 of his game-high 30 points in the second half, but it wasn't enough. Tyree Appleby added 14, but Florida made only 20 of 58 field-goal attempts (34.5 percent) in absorbing its second loss to Tennessee since Sunday. Mann canned 7 of 11 field goals, including 5 of 7 from the 3-point line, and was 9 of 10 at the foul line after halftime. However, the Gators couldn't get any closer than seven as the Volunteers owned a double-figure lead for most of the final 17 minutes. Tennessee sank 53.6 percent of its field goal tries in the second half, negating Mann's one-man show. Overall, the Volunteers shot 46.7 percent from the field. Tennessee established a working margin fairly quickly by working the ball inside. Of its first seven buckets, five were layups. Combined with a pair of 3-pointers from Pons and James, it gave the Volunteers a 16-8 lead at the 13:09 mark. James dunked with 8:29 left in the half to give Tennessee its first double-figure advantage at 20-10. The margin grew to 28-12 with 6:21 remaining when Uros Plavsic converted a layup. From that point, the Vols managed just Vescovi's 3-pointer 2:03 before intermission. However, Florida couldn't make dramatic inroads into the lead because its offense kept sputtering. It was able to use a 3-pointer from Appleby with 1:14 on the clock to close within 31-22 at halftime. The Gators converted just 9 of 30 shots in the first half and also coughed up nine turnovers. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "ATLANTA (AP) - Josef Martinez floated easily between Spanish and English, displaying the deftness he once showed with a soccer ball at his feet. Clearly, he has expanded his language skills over the past year. He was justifiably proud of the work he's done. \"Hey, nobody say anything about my English!\" he jokingly berated reporters during a Zoom call Friday. Martinez hopes that no translation will be needed, either, when he steps back on the playing field for his first game in more than a year. One of the most dynamic strikers in Major League Soccer history, and the face of Atlanta United's stunning rise to the top of the league, Martinez missed nearly all of last season recovering from a serious knee injury. With Martinez on the sidelines, the league went through a long pandemic shutdown before finally resuming play in July. But United was not the same team without its top player, struggling to score goals, firing coach Frank de Boer, and plodding to a dismal finish with a listless, uninspired group that missed the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.

One of the most dynamic strikers in Major League Soccer history, and the face of Atlanta United's stunning rise to the top of the league, Martinez missed nearly all of last season recovering from a serious knee injury. (AP Photo/John Bazemore, File)  Martinez is eager to lead a resurgence in the A-T-L. The league opener is April 10 at rival Orlando. \"That was a very hard year for everyone, especially with everything that happened,\" the 27-year-old Venezuelan said. \"I'm working to be - I don't know if it's 100% - but to be able to train and hopefully for the first game. I'm OK. I'm feeling good.\" Martinez tore the ACL in his right knee during the league opener at Nashville, depriving United of a player who scored a then-record 31 goals and won the MVP award during its run to the MLS Cup title in 2018. Overall, he has 77 goals in 84 MLS games. After going down, Martinez was barely able to watch - especially when he saw how far United tumbled without him. The team won just six of 23 games, averaging a mere one goal per contest. Only Cincinnati scored fewer - an especially jarring comedown for a franchise that played a thrilling, offensive-minded style during its first two seasons under coach Tata Martino. \"I watched the first two games (of the MLS Is Back tournament) in Orlando, but after that I didn't watch any more,\" Martinez said. \"I'm not there to help and I get frustrated and I get mad. I don't like it when I get mad because I break my house.\" The grind of rehab - especially with the team struggling and so many restrictive protocols in place because of the pandemic - was also difficult. All sorts of doubts would creep into his head as he worked with head trainer Mario Cruz. \"I know it's a long year, but day to day the mentality is tough,\" said Martinez, sporting a scruffy beard and a collection of jewelry running the length of his left ear. \"In the mornings, I would talk to Mario and I'd say, `I don\u00b4t want to play anymore,' because in that moment I couldn't walk. Then in the afternoon, I feel OK - until the next day is another day.\" These days, Martinez is thrilled to be going through the monotony of preseason training under new coach Gabriel Heinze. \"I\u00b4m so happy to be back on the field and to enjoy it with my teammates,\" Martinez said. United has undergone a huge overhaul since entering the league in 2017, with Martinez among just a handful of players still around from that inaugural season. He's also adjusting to his third coach in five seasons with the club. Heinze certainly brings a different demeanor than the stoic de Boer. \"He is very tough,\" Martinez said of Heinze. \"He has a passion for what he is doing. He thinks he\u00b4s still a professional soccer player. If you don\u00b4t give 100%, he\u00b4ll kill you. You have to be ready for that. We have to be open to that intensity because that\u00b4s what we missed the last year. For the moment we\u00b4re tired, because we run a lot.\" Martinez is still struggling a bit with the transition from recuperating player to healthy player. \"The most difficult thing was returning to feel like a soccer player,\" he said in Spanish. \"The first days that I started to touch the ball were tough. They are still tough. It\u00b4s what I had to deal with. \"I\u00b4m not the first or last person who has had this injury. I\u00b4ve cried many times, even last week when I had my first scrimmage and when I go out to train I feel nostalgic because they were tough days. But you have to continue.\" ___ Follow Paul Newberry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/paulnewberry ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "full article": "SHIRLEY CONRAN: As someone who is known as 'Superwoman', I never dreamt I would want to commit suicideAs someone who is known as 'Superwoman', I never dreamt I would want to commit suicide.\u00a0I thought only weak-minded people did \u2014 not strong-minded people like me. But the night I decided it was easier to start sleeping under a rug on the sofa in the sitting room, rather than make the extra effort to go to bed, should have rung alarm bells.Even into my late 80s, I've never let standards slip. I have even been known to undertake a little light cleaning in the middle of the night, if I had trouble sleeping.Then, two months after the first lockdown began, having reached rock bottom, I considered taking my life. Humiliated, I was finally forced to seek outside help.In nearly a year of dealing with social care in Britain, my main, depressing observation is that even private savings count for little in a system that is broken and unfit for purpose.\u00a0There is no joined-up thinking between the NHS and Social Services, leaving those who need help most to sink.If I \u2014 a tough, confident businesswoman and former editor \u2014 have struggled, I can't imagine what it's like for the disadvantaged. Quite simply, it's a national disgrace.Our care system was already broken before Covid-19 increased the burden. When you realise that, then you realise the extent and urgency of the problem. Age care requires not only a major funding injection but long-term reform.Boris Johnson made a pre-election promise that if he won, he would 'fix' social care for good (it's the main reason I voted for him).Yet the Chancellor's latest Budget did not once mention the matter. As Mail City editor Alex Brummer commented: 'What was missing in the Budget? There was absolutely no reference to social care, which is one of the biggest problems facing this country.'The dreaded virus is not, as some think, an excuse for the Government's inaction. Successive governments have kicked this can down the road. But I believe this pandemic presents us with a unique opportunity.As I've discovered for myself, the system desperately needs fixing.

Then I wobbled home happy, supported by my son and two NHS walking sticks.\u00a0I prefer to live alone and had adequate home help from a friend for two mornings a week, plus the visiting hospital physiotherapist, who was free. I also paid for a chiropractor for my permanently painful arthritic right knee.After lockdown, however, all human help was suddenly removed. As I was shielding, no one was allowed inside my flat in Central London. I felt as if my crutches had been ruthlessly yanked away.As I wrote in the Mail last year, I tried to make the best of it. I read, I wrote, I played Scrabble online. But slowly, in the weeks that followed, I fell apart.Even eating was stressful \u2014 it took me six weeks to get added to a supermarket delivery priority list.\u00a0My family have always been exceptionally supportive of me, but my sons were both overworked with coronavirus-related business crises, so I didn't want to bother them. A neighbour bought me bread and milk, and I relied on my freezer.Breakfast became instant coffee and a biscuit. So did lunch. In my already weakened body, my energy levels were reduced.         Pictured:\u00a0English designer and entrepreneur Terence Conran with his wife Shirley and their baby son Sebastian at home, 1956.\u00a0Shirley Conran: If I \u2014 a tough, confident businesswoman and former editor \u2014 have struggled [during the pandemic], I can't imagine what it's like for the disadvantaged. Quite simply, it's a national disgraceI couldn't spend time with friends or relatives in person but, in any case, I didn't have enough energy to think or talk. I stopped answering emails and telephone calls.Sternly, I told myself to keep calm and do my best. But my best wasn't good enough. By May, I couldn't concentrate enough to read books, and eventually I had no energy to get to the bathroom.That's when the soft, seductive siren voices began to call to my fifth-floor flat: 'Just . . . jump.' I had never felt so low in my life. It made me feel guilty and fearful.Too ashamed to phone either of my sisters, I didn't want to worry my sons, so I called my beloved, practical ex-daughter-in-law, Georgina, who told me to dial 111 immediately.Normally, you would call your GP but in those early days of the pandemic I couldn't get through. Doctors were frantically overworked like everyone else.What followed was an immensely stressful ordeal that took 22 telephone calls to 111 \u2014 one lasted for 40 minutes \u2014 to reach the right people. Every time I called, I had to repeat all my details again.Eventually, I was passed to two departments: NHS Mental Health and my local council's Social Services. A psychiatrist and a psychologist came to see me.\u00a0They spent two hours with me and helped me to understand that my condition was a result of the virus fallout. The lack of human help had affected me physically and this had produced a knock-on effect on my mental health.         Pictured: An elderly woman sitting on the edge of her bed in a nursing home with her head down while a care worker sits close with her for comfortOn top of all that, the 111 calls had been exhausting and infuriating \u2014 but a penny had dropped. Pandemic or no pandemic, I was experiencing at first hand the perilous state of elder care in this country. And I was angry.Since then, the more care I've required, the more I've realised not only the exorbitant costs (a private care home can be \u00a3130,000 a year), but quite how antiquated and confusing the whole healthcare system for the aged is.These days, I have half an hour of local council care twice a week to shower me, which costs me \u00a31,000 a year. Recently, because of my council's subcontractor's incompetence, I was left unwashed for ten days but still had to pay for it.To be able to walk, I need 20 minutes a week with a private chiropractor, which costs \u00a375 \u2014 or \u00a33,900 a year. As I can no longer reach my toenails, my feet are cared for by Jackie from the charity Age UK, who visits me for \u00a322 for half an hour every six weeks, which totals \u00a3176 a year.Many people can't afford more than \u00a35,000 a year for about an hour-and-a-half of care a week. The cost certainly came as a shock to me.But if the lockdowns have taught me anything, it's how valuable human help is to old people \u2014 and the fact that your needs can suddenly increase overnight.\u00a0Over the course of three lockdowns, I have experienced three relapses (both physical and mental) and two blackouts, requiring ambulance dashes to A&E. I was given MRI scans and sent home, albeit significantly weaker.I can afford care for my current needs, but I'm bound to require more care in the future and private care costs are eye-watering. Providers can charge \u00a345 an hour to push your wheelchair for a walk.         Boris Johnson made a pre-election promise that if he won, he would 'fix' social care for good (it's the main reason I voted for him),' writes Conran. Yet the Chancellor's latest Budget did not once mention the matter. As Mail City editor Alex Brummer commented: 'What was missing in the Budget? There was absolutely no reference to social care, which is one of the biggest problems facing this country.'Eventually, I may need permanent live-in care. If so, I might be able to get a private nurse for \u00a3650 a week, plus the cost of her food and living expenses \u2014 say another weekly \u00a350: that will cost \u00a335,000 a year from my savings.\u00a0If I live long enough to get a birthday card from HM The Queen, it might cost me a total of \u00a3420,000 [yes, four noughts], not allowing for inflation.My mother lived to be 97 and I had no trouble paying my share for her delightful care home. But she died 14 years ago, and even a local council care home can now cost from \u00a31,000 a week.A private care home can cost up to \u00a32,500 a week, which is \u00a3130,000 a year [four noughts again]. Few families can afford that, especially as old people live longer if they are well cared for.NHS healthcare, funded by the taxpayer, involves the treatment, care or aftercare of someone with a disease, illness, injury or disability. Social care is provided by local government \u2014 your local council \u2014 and is means-tested: it helps with your daily life, such as shopping and washing yourself.Then you have the postcode lottery. The amount of free care you are entitled to may depend on where you live and your circumstances. You could be charged nothing, or from \u00a320 an hour to provide care in your own home.The greater use of private-sector providers of home-care service, together with a tendency for street-sharp authorities to charge commercial rates, has increasingly blurred the boundaries between private and public sector.Since 2010, the State has cut spending on adult social care by \u00a386 million, despite the rapidly increasing demands of an ageing population. According to Age UK, 1.5 million pensioners don't receive the care and support they need.         Margaret Yeoman, 90, seeing her son John Yeoman, 62, and his wife Denise Yeoman, 63, for the first time in eight weeks as they visit her at the Eothen Homes care home in Whitley Bay, Tyneside in May last yearJust after World War II, the Labour Party started our brilliant NHS. We need equally radical changes now \u2014 and this time the money should be spent on Social Services, ensuring that they dovetail efficiently with the NHS.As our Chancellor is borrowing a great deal of money to get this country up and running again, why doesn't he borrow a bit more \u2014 especially when interest rates are so low, and updating Social Services will undoubtedly provide more jobs.By 2040, one Briton in four will be over 65 years old and eventually need NHS and local council help.A person aged 65 can expect to have care costs of about \u00a340,000, on average, over later life, whether or not these costs are met by the council. But there is a lot of variation. Around one person in ten will have care costs of more than \u00a3100,000 before accommodation costs, while around one in four will have no costs at all.The trouble is, we can't predict which category we \u2014 or our parents \u2014 will fall into. There is far too much confusion. How do you find out what care you're entitled to? Where might you go if you are not entitled to anything?You need to know to ask the right questions. I didn't realise this until I started to ask persistent, searching questions of my local council and would not be deflected.It took me weeks, and I still haven't got all the answers I need.Who is entitled to state-funded social care? The answer is, not many of us. You are eligible for free social care if you own nothing, have less than \u00a316,000 in savings or if all your possessions are worth less than \u00a323,250. In these days when the average house costs \u00a3252,000, this is vanishingly few.To many, there seems an unfair gap between those who get expensive free care for their parents and those who don't and so will have to pay for what they can afford.Whatever the cost of care today, you cannot guess correctly how much it will cost in the future.Sometimes my dread catches me by surprise at 3am, a time when everything seems bleaker. Now, when that happens, by prior arrangement I phone my eldest son, who is a logical professor. He calms me down and then, he tells me later, spends the rest of the night worrying about his own future and whether he will be a burden on his two sons.That did it for me. It is the potential burden on my grandchildren, now 30 and 25, that really makes me realise we have to act. I don't want my grandchildren to feel that their parents are an unfair financial burden. I don't want my grandchildren to feel impotent or angry. Or indeed suicidal.Thinking of that makes me want to kick something \u2014 or to kick Boris out at the next election. Never mind keeping calm and carrying on, we need to do something.Every OAP should write to their MP now and demand to be told what he or she is doing to provide adequate age care. We should deluge Boris with real, stamped letters hollering for help.         Pictured:\u00a0Care home resident Dot Hendy holds her daughter Louise's hand for the first time since March after Louise successfully passed a Rapid Covid-19 Test immediately before meeting her mother at the King Charles Court Care Home, Falmouth, on November 18, 2020I propose a long, traffic-stopping wheelchair protest to No. 10, with dodderers angrily waving crutches and teenage grandchildren \u2014 good for photo-ops \u2014 carrying banners reading 'AGE CARE OR OUT!'We might head the protest with some articulate National Treasures of pensionable age: perhaps 74-year-old Felicity Kendal strutting along in silver thigh boots, twirling a baton ahead of a geriatric male brass band; and Joan Collins on the back of a white horse led by the equally indomitable Joanna Lumley, 74. (Remember what Joanna did for the Gurkhas.)In case you think that's an unrealistic plan, I did something similar for Women's Lib \u2014 heading a flaming torchlit march from the House of Commons to No. 10, requesting equal pay and equal opportunity. The result was the Equal Pay Act of 1970.So, Boris, please remember that you yourself will need age care one day \u2014 especially for those knees, after all that jogging and cycling you do. Bear in mind that on a Prime Minister's pension alone, you wouldn't be able to afford private care.Don't think for one moment that we older voters will let you get away with breaking your election promise. Our memories may be failing, but every time we falter or fall \u2014 or are left unclean for days \u2014 we will remember who is ultimately responsible. You are.For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 116123 or go to www.samaritans.org.",

After a game that had plenty of industry but precious little quality, Newcastle substitute Jacob Murphy came close to giving the home side the lead as he smacked a right-foot shot off the crossbar in the 83rd minute. It was to prove a costly miss as Villa striker Ollie Watkins latched onto a Matt Targett cross three minutes later and his header deflected off Clarke into the net. Lascelles then popped up to head home in the fourth minute of stoppage time to grab a point that leaves Newcastle in 16th spot on 28 points from 28 games, two points above the relegation zone.

        "title": "Tennessee routs Gators 78-66 in SEC quarterfinals",
        "full article": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Tennessee Volunteers could be without their big senior for the Southeastern Conference Tournament semifinals against sixth-ranked Alabama. Coach Rick Barnes said John Fulkerson was taken to a hospital Friday for observation, possibly for an eye injury, after a couple of elbows from Florida forward Omar Payne to the head early in the second half. \"We'll wait and see,\" Barnes said. \"But my gut feeling he took two pretty good licks there, and I'd be surprised if he is available.\" Santiago Vescovi scored 14 points to lead five Volunteers in double figures, and Tennessee beat Florida 78-66 to advance to the SEC semifinals for a third straight tournament. The Volunteers (18-7) also won their second straight over Florida in the span of six days. The first gave the Vols a bye to the SEC quarterfinals, and they never trailed Friday to advance to Saturday's semifinal against sixth-ranked Alabama, the SEC regular-season champ and an 85-48 winner over Mississippi State. Yves Pons nearly had a triple-double with 11 points, eight rebounds and nine blocked shots that tied the SEC tournament single-game record set by Kentucky's Andre Riddick in the 1993 title game. Keon Johnson and Jaden Springer each had 13 points for the Vols, and Josiah-Jordan James added 10 with nine rebounds.          Tennessee's John Fulkerson lies on the court after being fouled by Florida's Omar Payne in the second half of an NCAA college basketball game in the Southeastern Conference Tournament Friday, March 12, 2021, in Nashville, Tenn. Payne was ejected from the game. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)  Florida (14-9) lost for the second time in three games. Tre Mann, who was 1 of 8 for two points in the first half, finished with a career-high 30 points for the Gators. Tyree Appleby added 14. Tennessee beat Florida 65-54 last Sunday to split the season series and earn the bye over the Gators. The Vols seemingly picked up where they left off, taking the lead off a Fulkerson dunk 16 seconds into the game. They led 31-22 at halftime. Play got heated with 17:10 left when Fulkerson had to be helped to the locker room after a pair of elbows to his head from Payne. Replays showed Payne caught Fulkerson' with a left, forearm shiver to the face, then put his right elbow into Fulkerson's head. Officials ejected Payne after review. Florida coach Mike White said after the game he hadn't seen a replay of the foul. \"I hope he\u00b4s OK,\" said White, who gave Fulkerson an ovation on Senior Day last weekend. \"Got a lot of respect for him, the way he plays, the way he approaches the game.\" The Vols, who led 35-26 at the time, scored eight of the next 11 and pushed the lead to as much as 17. \"I saw him just elbow Johnny in the face,\" Pons said. \"There's nothing to do on the basketball court, and of course we took it personally.\" FULKERSON UPDATE Tennessee shared a video from Fulkerson on Friday night showing the senior with a shiner under his right eye. Fulkerson thanked fans for their support over the past few hours but also said he wasn't sure of his status for the semifinals. BIG PICTURE Florida: The SEC's best-shooting team couldn't outshoot the Vols as they shot only 34.5% (20 of 58) compared to 46.7% (28 of 60). ... The Gators also struggled with their composure a bit too. Not only was Payne ejected for the flagrant foul, they picked up another technical with 11:49 to go during a media timeout. \"I think we lack the emotional maturity that you need day in and day out to be a championship-level team,\" White said. Tennessee: Pons, the SEC defensive player of the year as a junior last season, had a career-high in blocked shots while also tying the school's single-game record by halftime with six. The Vols had an 11-5 edge in blocked shots. \"He was terrific,\" Barnes said. \"I mean he was locked in.\" UP NEXT Tennessee hasn't won this event since 1979. But the Vols now are a win away from reaching the championship game for a third straight tournament, not counting last year with the cancellation. First, they must beat Alabama, which handed the Vols their first loss this season 71-63 on Jan. 2 in Knoxville. Florida now waits for its NCAA Tournament seeding that wasn't helped much by a win Thursday over Vanderbilt. ___ Follow Teresa M.

        "title": "US resumes aid to Yemen's rebel north as famine threatens",
        "full article": "The United States announced a resumption of aid to Yemen\u00b4s rebel-held north on Friday to fight a looming famine as the country\u00b4s nearly six-year-old war grinds on. U.N. officials warned that a blockade of fuel deliveries to a main port was heightening the world\u00b4s worst humanitarian crisis. The aid concern came as President Joe Biden\u00b4s envoy to Yemen expressed frustration at the country\u00b4s Houthi rebels, saying they were focusing on fighting to capture more territory while an international and regional diplomatic push was underway to end the conflict. \"Tragically, and somewhat confusingly for me, it appears that the Houthis are prioritizing a military campaign\" to seize central Marib province, envoy Tim Lenderking said. He spoke in an online event sponsored by the Atlantic Council think tank, after his more than two-week trip in the region to push for a cease-fire and ultimately a peace deal. The developments deepen the challenges for the Biden administration as it goes out on a limb to try to end the Yemen war through diplomacy, reversing previous U.S. administrations' support for an inconclusive Saudi-led military offensive that tried to roll back the Iran-allied Houthi rebels. The rebels have shown no sign of relenting despite Biden's diplomatic overtures, adding to tensions between the U.S. and its strategic partner Saudi Arabia. Lenderking said the Houthis have had a cease-fire proposal before them for a \"number of days\" and urged them to respond positively. He gave no details, including whether the proposal was new or an updated version of a nationwide cease-fire plan that U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths announced last year.          FILE - In this Nov. 23, 2019 file photo, a woman holds her malnourished boy at a feeding center at the Al-Sabeen Hospital in Sanaa, Yemen. After a visit to Yemen the World Food Program's executive director, David Beasley, warned that his underfunded organization may be forced seek hundreds of millions of dollars in private donations in a desperate bid to stave off widespread famine in the coming months. Beasley told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday, March 10, 2021, that conditions in war-wrecked Yemen are \"hell.\" (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed, File)  Fighting and massive displacement of people, crippling fuel shortages and rising food prices have 50,000 Yemenis already caught up in famine and 5 million more a step away from it, the United Nations says. It projects 400,000 Yemeni children under 5 are at risk of dying this year from malnutrition. The war began when the Houthi rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north in 2014. Saudi Arabia has led an unsuccessful air campaign since 2015 to try to dislodge the rebels, while rival Iran has consolidated its support for the Houthis. Biden has reversed Obama and Trump administration policy in the conflict by pulling U.S. support for the Saudi-led offensive. Biden's six-week-old administration is reviving U.S. diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. Friday\u00b4s announcement on renewed U.S. humanitarian support for the north comes about a year after the Trump administration stopped some aid on the grounds that Houthis were diverting the foreign assistance for themselves. The Trump administration move affected about $50 million in aid, out of more than $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance the U.S. has provided Yemen since 2019, the U.S. Agency for International Development said. The Biden administration as of Friday will \"cautiously resume\" support to humanitarian groups working in Yemen\u00b4s north, said Sarah Charles, a senior official for humanitarian assistance at the U.S. AID. The resumed U.S. humanitarian support would come with new measures and monitoring to try to make sure the Houthis aren't interfering with the aid, Charles said, speaking at the same virtual forum as Lenderking. The U.S. could suspend support for some programs again if warranted, she said. The Biden administration last month also lifted the Trump administration\u00b4s designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization, saying the prohibitions that went along with the designation interfered with critical aid delivery to civilians in rebel areas. Critics said the move sent the wrong signal, especially at a time when the Houthis have stepped up cross-border drone and missile attacks into Saudi Arabia and are fighting to seize control of oil-rich Marib province from Yemen\u00b4s internationally recognized government. Saudi-led warplanes have countered the Houthi advance in Marib, which is sheltering about a million Yemenis who have fled Houthi offensives elsewhere in the country. Lenderking and U.N. World Food Program executive director David Beasley, speaking separately to reporters about his own talks with the Houthis, U.S. officials and other players in the conflict also pointed to interruptions in fuel deliveries to Yemen. They warned that the disruption is depriving aid convoys, homes, hospitals and businesses of needed fuel. Beasley earlier described a visit this week to a child-malnutrition ward in a Sanaa hospital, where he saw children wasting away. Many, he said, were on the brink of death from entirely preventable and treatable causes, and they were the lucky ones who were receiving medical care. The Houthis have demanded Saudis lift a port blockade of rebel areas and cease their military campaign in the country. At U.N. headquarters in New York on Friday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that no commercial fuel imports at all made it through the rebel-held main Hodeida port last month, for the first time since the Saudi-led offensive began. The fuel shortage was driving up prices of food and other critical goods, Dujarric said. Beasley, the World Food Program chief, said the fuel shortages threatened to undermine what remains of Yemen's private sector and swell the numbers of Yemenis needing aid. \"I expressed to not just the United States but other major players around the world that this fuel blockade is going to create havoc and we need to work through this immediately,\" Beasley said. -- Knickmeyer reported from Oklahoma City and Lederer from the United Nations.

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that more than 16 million people in Yemen would go hungry this year, with already some half a million living in famine-like condition in the conflict-wrecked country. The stark warning comes a day before a pledging conference co-hosted by Sweden and Switzerland. (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed, File)",

        "full article": "Protesters with placards with the image of detained Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi hold a candlelight vigil and shout slogans in Yangon on March 12, 2021  The US government said Friday that Myanmar citizens stranded by the violence following the country's military coup would be able to remain inside the United States under \"temporary protected status.\" \"Due to the military coup and security forces' brutal violence against civilians, the people of Burma are suffering a complex and deteriorating humanitarian crisis in many parts of the country,\" said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, using Myanmar's former name. \"After a thorough review of this dire situation, I have designated Burma for temporary protected status so that Burmese nationals and habitual residents may remain temporarily in the United States.\" The United States has granted TPS protection to nationals of a number of countries struck by political upheavals or natural disasters that make their return difficult. The protection is usually set for a limited period, like 12 months, but can be extended if the hardships or threats remain. DHS said the February 1 takeover by Myanmar's military has led to an economic crisis and shortages of humanitarian and medical aid. In addition, it said the people protesting the coup face arbitrary detention, intimidation and lethal violence from the military. \"Such conditions prevent Burmese nationals and habitual residents from returning safely,\" the department said in a statement. The initial TPS order will last 18 months. DHS said about 1,600 people in the United States now would qualify for it. Earlier this week President Joe Biden's administration offered TPS for tens of thousands of Venezuelans who fled political repression and economic chaos in the once wealthy South American country. At the US State Department, spokesman Ned Price assailed the Myanmar junta Friday for ongoing attacks on protestors. \"The military and police have shown complete disregard for the people of Burma and have targeted young people, doctors, civil servants journalists and political activists,\" he said. \"We reiterate our calls to the military and the police to stop the violence and arbitrary detention, to release all those unjustly detained and, again, to restore the democratically elected civilian government.\"",

        "title": "Stay or go? Fence, Guard pose Capitol security questions",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Nobody, it seems, wants to keep the security fence around the U.S. Capitol anymore - except the police who fought off the horrific attack on Jan. 6. Lawmakers call the razor-topped fencing \"ghastly,\" too militarized and, with the armed National Guard troops still stationed at the Capitol since a pro-Trump mob laid siege, not at all representative of the world\u00b4s leading icon of democracy. \"All you have to do is to see the fencing around the Capitol to be shocked,\" Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in an interview Friday. How to protect lawmakers, while keeping the bucolic Capitol grounds open to visitors has emerged as one of the more daunting, wrenching questions from deadly riot. Not since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has security been so elevated, and the next steps so uncertain, for the Capitol complex. Five people died after the mob stormed the building trying to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\u00b4s election over Republican Donald Trump. The former president was impeached by the House, and acquitted by the Senate, for inciting the insurrection. The U.S. Capitol Police has asked for the fencing and the National Guard to remain, for now.          National Guard open a gate in the razor wire topped perimeter fence around the Capitol allow another member in at sunrise in Washington, Monday, March 8, 2021. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  Police officers are working grueling round-the-clock overtime shifts after being overrun that day, engaging at times in hand-to-hand combat with rioters outfitted in combat gear and armed with bats, poles and other weaponry. One woman was shot and killed by police and an officer died later, among scores of police injured in what officials have said appeared to be a planned and coordinated assault. With warnings of another attack in early March by pro-Trump militants and threats on lawmakers that have nearly doubled since the start of 2021, the police, the Pentagon and lawmakers themselves are wrestling with how best to secure what has been a sprawling campus mostly open to visiting tourists and neighborhood dog walkers alike. \"The attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th forever changed how we look at the 'People\u00b4s House,'\" acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said in written testimony before Congress in February. She said that even before the 9/11 attacks, security experts, including former chiefs of police, argued that more needed to be done to protect the Capitol complex. \"The Capitol\u00b4s security infrastructure must change,\" Pittman testified. While some lawmakers say privately they appreciate the heightened security, taking down the protective perimeter and easing the National Guard\u00b4s presence is the one issue that appears to be uniting both Democrats and Republicans in the toxic political environment on Capitol Hill since the deadly riot. One option that has emerged is for a mobile, retractable barrier that could be put up as needed. \"What we have now, that\u00b4s just unacceptable to me,\" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic majority whip, told reporters. \"It\u00b4s just ghastly, it\u00b4s an embarrassment. If there\u00b4s a better way to protect us, I want to see it. I want to work to get it.\" Lawmakers described their unease at arriving for work each day in what can feel like a war zone. The absence of tourists snapping photos of the Capitol dome or constituents meeting with representatives is an emotional loss on top of COVID-19 restrictions, they said. The security perimeter extends far beyond the Capitol itself through neighboring parks and office buildings. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, compared it to a combat zone in Afghanistan. \"I think we are way overreacting,\" he said at a press conference. As of Friday there were about 4,300 Guard troops in the city. This week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin formally approved the Capitol Police request to extend the deployment of nearly 2,300 Guard members for about two more months. The pushback from Capitol Hill was immediate and bipartisan. Top Republican senators on the Senate Armed Services, Homeland Security, Intelligence and other committees downplayed the potential threats to the Capitol, especially weighed against the drain on National Guard troops serving far from their homes. \"Our National Guard troops, who serve with great honor and distinction, are not law enforcement officers, and we will not abide the continued militarization of Capitol complex security,\" wrote Sens. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and others. \"We are deeply troubled by the current level of security around the United States Capitol,\" wrote the House Armed Services Committee's Democratic Chairman Adam Smith of Washington and Rep, Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican in a joint statement. They said while there is no doubt \"some level\" of support from the National Guard should remain in the region to respond to threats, \"the present security posture is not warranted at this time.\" Still, other lawmakers say privately they are comfortable keeping security high, for now, as the country tries to ease back to a sense of normalcy after the devastating attack on the seat of government. A sweeping security review conducted in the aftermath of the riot by a task force led by retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9 recommended eventually replacing the barrier with mobile fencing and \"an integrated, retractable fencing system\" that could be deployed as needed. Coupled with the hiring of 350 additional officers, the report also recommends establishing a permanent \"quick response force\" within the Capitol Police but also at the National Guard in D.C. for emergencies. There was a marked delay in sending the Guard to the Capitol on Jan. 6. A supplemental spending request for security is expected to be considered by Congress in April.

        "title": "Richard Masters says pandemic will cost PL almost \u00a32billion by end of season",
        "full article": "The coronavirus pandemic will have cost the Premier League close to \u00a32billion by the end of the season, its chief executive Richard Masters has said, but he hopes to start next season with full stadia. Saturday marks a year since the suspension of the English professional game because of the Covid-19 outbreak, leaving the league open to demands for rebates from broadcasters and its clubs unable to welcome spectators to any meaningful level since. And Masters laid bare the extent of the financial damage the pandemic had inflicted on the competition and its clubs.   \u201cThere have been very significant financial losses, not just in the Premier League but throughout the football pyramid,\u201d he said. \u201cTowards the end of this season, we\u2019ll get towards \u00a32billion lost since the start of the pandemic in match day revenue and broadcast revenue.\u201d Masters has great optimism for the future, however, and believes there is a chance of full stadia for the start of the 2021-22 season. \u201cA lot of things have got to happen at the right time to get there, but we believe it\u2019s an achievable goal,\u201d he said. Masters confirmed that the league hoped to be able to play the final two rounds of the current season in front of up to 10,000 spectators under the Government\u2019s road map for the easing of coronavirus restrictions, and said the continued success of the vaccination programme was key to venues returning to full capacity in the future. Masters was asked about the hours and days leading up to the suspension last March. He attended the last Premier League match before the suspension, Leicester v Aston Villa, on March 9. The Premier League, FA, EFL and WSL have collectively agreed to postpone the professional game in EnglandFull statement: https://t.co/XcDyzBp4Ol pic.twitter.com/cmYjoY3LRR\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) March 13, 2020   \u201cI remember travelling back from that match, feeling we were under criticism, that we were under scrutiny for continuing to play football,\u201d he said. On the evening of Thursday, March 12 the league stated its intention to carry on playing but immediately afterwards, Masters was informed that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi had tested positive. \u201cThose were the first positive tests in the Premier League cohort that we knew about, and that changed everything,\u201d Masters said. The decision to suspend the 2019-20 season came the following day, and Masters recalled that the mood at the clubs shareholders\u2019 meeting to rubber-stamp it was \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201crealistic\u201d. He insists that right from the start, there was no push to either curtail the season or declare it null and void. \u201cAs early as that first meeting, the primary objective of the Premier League and its clubs was to finish the season,\u201d he said. \u201cThat collective will never really wavered throughout.\u201d Project Restart gathered momentum in May when clubs returned to training, after players were given assurances over safety from deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam among others. Masters described the conclusion of the restarted season as a \u201csprint\u201d, in contrast to the 2020-21 campaign. \u201cThis feels more like a marathon. The schedule that we have put in front of the players and the clubs is pretty brutal,\u201d he admitted. A surge in new cases at the turn of the year, driven by a more transmissible variant of the virus, threatened to derail the season as matches were forced to be postponed, sometimes at very late notice. Masters said the league had not been near to a further suspension at that point, but that it was \u201cthe nearest they had come\u201d since restarting last summer. The league tightened safety protocols and introduced new ones, including reminders to players around over-exuberant goal celebrations and contact before and after matches. Masters believes those two areas have \u201cdramatically changed\u201d and pointed to the reduction in positive tests as proof \u2013 they have been stable at just two per week for five weeks in a row now. The end of the season will give players chance to think again about the best way to promote the anti-racism message. The death in police custody of George Floyd in the United States last May sparked a rise in Black Lives Matter protests, and when the Premier League resumed the following month players took the knee as a show of solidarity. It is a gesture which has been almost unanimously observed since, although Wilfried Zaha has said he will no longer do so because it was \u201csomething we just do now\u201d. Masters said taking the knee would continue \u201cto the end of the season\u201d and that there would then be fresh talks with players over the most effective way forward.",

        "full article": "Anthony Watson reaches a milestone in his England career grateful for guidance from Kyle Sinckler that steered him away from seeking the limelight. Watson wins his 50th cap in Saturday\u2019s Guinness Six Nations clash with France at Twickenham as one of Eddie Jones\u2019 best performing players in an otherwise disappointing campaign. The 27-year-old Lion has been a consistent threat for England since making his debut in 2014 and is an automatic pick under Jones, but his long absence with a twice-ruptured achilles forced a reordering of priorities.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Anthony Watson (@anthonywatson)  Recovery came in time for the 2019 Word Cup and his defence-shredding runs are now motivated by a different impulse inspired by the words of red rose team-mate Sinckler. \u201cWhen I got my first cap I was pretty immature. I was trying to be in the limelight for not necessarily the right reasons, trying to be more than a rugby player,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI was interested in a lot of other stuff besides rugby but as Kyle Sinckler always says to me: \u2018you\u2019ve got to keep the main thing the main thing\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s probably where most of the shift has come in terms of mindset and focus on what\u2019s important. That\u2019s how it has changed from cap one to cap 50. \ud83d\udcac \"He\u2019s at close to his best \u2013 we hope his 50th game will be his best game.\u201d@anthonywatson_ will make his 50th England appearance on Saturday, hear what Eddie had to say ahead of the milestone match \u2935\ufe0f\u2014 England Rugby (@EnglandRugby) March 11, 2021   \u201cThe achilles injury was massive for me because I realised that while some of the off-field stuff was there, the things that really made me happy \u2013 playing rugby \u2013 weren\u2019t. \u201cThat was a pretty stark realisation and Kyle was really important to me through that whole process. \u201cThere were times during that injury where I was off trying to do media or marketing stuff and he was like, \u2018you need to keep the main thing the main thing\u2019. \u201cThat hit home with me and made me realise that if I want to keep doing what I love I need to make sure I keep it the main thing and not the other way round. \u201cIt comes with age and maturity. We\u2019ve all got a finite amount of years playing this game and you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to come to an end.\u201d Watson is playing some of the best rugby of his career, crossing twice in the last two games, and England will need him firing on all cylinders if they are to topple tournament favourites France. Inspired by their irrepressible scrum-half Antoine Dupont, Les Bleus have rebuilt under head coach Fabien Galthie and now match historical strengths with a more efficient tactical approach. \u201cThe ability to play from anywhere and be unpredictable is built into French rugby,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThat is the identity of French rugby and it\u2019s good for the sport and it\u2019s good that they have been able to hold that, even though they have changed a bit in terms of their pragmatism through their kicking.\u201d While acknowledging England must execute tactically, Charlie Ewels insists \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 will also be fuelled by passion. \u201cEmotion always comes into it,\u201d said Watson\u2019s Bath time-mate, who replaces Jonny Hill in the second row. \u201cWe play a confrontational sport \u2013 it can never be a professional, technical thing because then you\u2019ll look flat and you\u2019ll never spark life into the things you want to do. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about England-France and who the opposition is, it\u2019s about the honour and opportunity of representing your country and all the emotion that brings.\u201d",

        "title": "Stocks post sharp weekly gains; Treasury yields, dollar rise",
        "full article": "By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - An index of stocks across the world dipped on Friday but still posted its strongest weekly gain in five, while benchmark U.S. Treasury yields climbed to 13-month highs, partly on optimism after a $1.9 trillion recovery package was signed into law. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 drifted higher to end up 0.1% on the day and 2.6% for the week, its strongest weekly showing since early February. The Nasdaq underperformed as the rotation from growth to value continued. The Dow Industrials hit an intraday record high every day this week. The Friday spike in Treasury yields supported the dollar, which closed the week down 0.3% against a basket of currency peers, the biggest drop in four weeks. With U.S. stimulus coming and vaccine rollouts reopening economies against a backdrop of super-loose monetary policy, some analysts expect inflation to pick up. \"We are back to the idea that more growth is more inflation and investors are a little nervous about current yield levels which is affecting tech stocks,\" said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments in Houston. \"It's all about the pace in which yields grow and the market seems to be comfortable with another 10-20 basis points jump in the benchmark yield if backed up by strong data that shows economic recovery.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 293.05 points, or 0.9%, to 32,778.64, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4 points, or 0.10%, to 3,943.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 78.81 points, or 0.59%, to 13,319.87. The Dow had its biggest week so far this year with a 4.1% advance and the Nasdaq posted its first positive week in four, up 3.1%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.26% on Friday and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.06%. Emerging market stocks lost 0.69%. Overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.64% lower, while Japan's Nikkei rose 1.73%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose above 1.6% and posted their seventh consecutive weekly rise. \"The bias in rates is still higher barring an unforeseen setback on the vaccines or explicit Fed action,\" said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities in New York. U.S. data showed producer prices posted in February their largest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years, but the currently high unemployment rate could make it harder for businesses to pass on the higher costs to consumers. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 28/32 in price to yield 1.6247%, from 1.527% late on Thursday. The recent, sharp, market moves give even more importance to next week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve for clues to its views on rising yields and the threat of inflation. In currency markets, the dollar index rose 0.243%, with the euro down 0.27% to $1.1952. The Japanese yen weakened 0.49% versus the greenback at 109.04 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3924, down 0.47% on the day. Markets are likely to remain volatile in the second quarter, particularly for the dollar, which was much stronger than expected at the start of the year, said Cliff Zhao, chief strategist at China Construction Bank International. \"The strong U.S. dollar may weigh on some liquidity conditions in the emerging markets,\" he said. The Institute of International Finance on Thursday urged the Fed to give guidance on its managing of higher yields to avoid even more outflows from emerging markets. Oil prices fell, with both Brent and WTI down slightly for the week after rising more than 10% over the past two. On Friday, U.S. crude fell 0.67% to $65.58 per barrel and Brent was at $69.20, down 0.62% on the day. Spot gold added 0.1% to $1,723.75 an ounce. Silver fell 0.82% to $25.86. Bitcoin last fell 1.92% to $56,661.44.

Downey Jr. was in the running for worst actor for playing the title role in \"Dolittle,\" a movie remake about a doctor who can talk to animals. \"Dolittle,\" released by Comcast Corp's Universal Pictures, tied for the most Razzie nominations with six overall including worst picture. It will compete with Netflix's Polish erotic drama \"365 Days,\" which also received six Razzie nods. Others contending for worst film included \"Music\" directed by musician Sia about a young girl with autism, and a movie remake of TV show \"Fantasy Island.\" Mike Lindell, chief executive of widely advertised company MyPillow and a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, was nominated for \"Absolute Proof,\" a film featuring baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. It also is competing for worst picture. Giuliani made the Razzies list for his brief appearance in Sacha Baron Cohen's mockumentary \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.\" The former mayor was filmed in a hotel room with an actress pretending to be a reporter. Giuliani has said nothing inappropriate happened. The tongue-in-cheek Razzies, created in 1980, serve as an antidote to Hollywood\u00b4s glitzy Academy Awards ceremony. Winners of the Razzies will be announced on April 24, the night before this year's Oscars.

Four days after a 1-0 defeat at league leaders Inter Milan, Pasalic and Muriel found the net in the second half to put fourth-placed Atalanta on 52 points from 27 games, level on points with Juventus who are third with two matches in hand. The pair lead fifth-placed AS Roma, who travel to second-bottom Parma on Sunday, by two points. Spezia, who reduced the arrears late on through Roberto Piccoli, are 16th on 26 points - six above the relegation zone. Atalanta were too deliberate in the build-up while Spezia stayed compact in the first half but the second period was another story. The home side went up a gear and Pasalic tapped in at the near post from Josip Ilicic's cross in the 53rd minute to open the scoring. Two minutes later, Muriel doubled the tally when he curled in a superb shot on the turn from just outside the box. Pasalic was at it again in the 72nd with a cool finish after being played through by substitute Duvan Zapata. Piccoli, on loan from Atalanta, pulled one back with nine minutes left but it was too little, too late for the visitors. Earlier, Lazio's Felipe Caicedo scored six minutes from time to earn his seventh-placed side a 3-2 home win over bottom club Crotone after they had lost their two previous league games.

Now, believe it or not, we all get to do it once more.Never mind that he turns 48 next month and way past the age when he should be challenging for titles with the lustre of the Players Championship. Never mind that it\u2019s always ended in heartbreak in the past, and the mighty Bryson DeChambeau, among others, is in position to deny him, just as he did last week at Bay Hill.Westwood is the halfway leader by a stroke from fellow Englishman Matt Fitzpatrick following a brilliant 66.

Could you imagine anyone more deserving of becoming the first?It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that Westwood is a man reborn. His chipping now is better than at any point in his career and he\u2019s found a putting stroke that works. He\u2019s brimming with confidence after forcing DeChambeau all the way to the final putt on the final green last Sunday and by his side is fiancee and caddy Helen Storey, who says all the right things.\u2018I believe I\u2019ve played some of the best golf of my career over the last 18 months and I\u2019ve won some big events against quality fields,\u2019 said Westwood. \u2018I just felt in control of all parts of my game and it was a pretty carefree round. I\u2019m comfortable when I walk out on to this course. I\u2019m just enjoying myself and making sure that I have fun.\u2019Adding to the fun for Britain\u2019s watching hordes is the fact that Fitzpatrick will be right by his side on Saturday following a fine 68 of his own.         Bryson DeChambeau moved to six under at the halfway stage of the Players ChampionshipAt 26, he is not much more than half Westwood\u2019s age and desperate to add an American success to his five European titles. Having finished 6th, 11th and 10th in his three American starts this year, the Sheffield man is bang in form.Just three off the pace is DeChambeau. He began with a double bogey and his missiles off the tee frequently went off-radar. Yet he brushed aside the rudest of awakenings and eve-rything else besides to give himself every chance of completing a spectacular Florida double. \u2018I wasn\u2019t hitting it my best today, \u2019 conceded DeChambeau. \u2018But I fought hard, I had a bit of luck and I was able to scrap it round.\u2019There was no way back for Rory McIlroy. No player since 2000 had recovered from a first round 79 to make the halfway cut and he was never in position to make a run at becoming the first, signing for a 75 to miss the cut by a distance. The Northern Irishman has much to ponder with the Masters now less than a month away.Spare a thought, too, for playing partner Sergio Garcia, the leader on day one. He had four three putts and went from first to almost last in the putting statistics in a 72 that was hard at times to watch.\u00a0At the 15th he missed a putt of no more than 15 inches. But he\u2019s still only two shots off the pace, in pursuit of the man he first partnered in the Ryder Cup way back in 2002.

KORE said on Friday the deal with Cerberus Telecom Acquisition Corp will fetch the merged company about $484 million in gross cash proceeds. The payment will include $225 million private investment led by Koch Strategic Platforms LLC and other top-tier investors, such as funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Inc. Arby Partners, an existing majority shareholder in KORE, will roll its entire common equity into the combined company. Founded in 2003, KORE is a provider of IoT, or Internet of Things solutions and connectivity-as-a-Service (Caas). CTAC, a so-called special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, raised $250 million through an initial public offering last year. SPACs are shell companies that raise funds to acquire a private entity with the aim of taking it public, allowing such companies to eschew the hassles associated with a traditional IPOs. The combined company expects to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will trade under the new ticker symbol \"KORE.\" Cowen and Company LLC and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC are acting as financial advisers to the merging companies.

        "full article": "GENEVA (AP) - Activists protesting the 2022 Beijing Olympics hoped China\u00b4s record on human rights would get on the agenda this week at a major IOC gathering. The International Olympic Committee was just as determined not to speak publicly of the \"No Beijing 2022\" campaign\u00b4s concerns. Words like Uyghur detention camps, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and certainly not genocide, were unspoken by Olympic officials across three days of debate broadcast online, and three news conferences that wrapped on Friday. Instead, the IOC praised Beijing\u00b4s Winter Games preparations and announced a vaccine diplomacy deal with China to help inoculate athletes worldwide. Pressed on if the Olympic movement had dismissed the activists\u00b4 causes, newly re-elected IOC president Thomas Bach stressed the limits of its political role. \"We are not a super-world government where the IOC could solve or even address issues for which not the UN security council, no G7, no G20 has solutions,\" Bach said at a news conference on Friday.

A small core of international lawyers and activists are prodding leading Olympic sponsors to acknowledge China's widely reported human-rights abuses against Muslim Uyghurs, Tibetans and other minorities.(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)  This insistence on political neutrality has frustrated campaigners uniting around Olympics they have branded \"Genocide Games\" for the treatment of China\u00b4s Muslim minority Uyghur people in the western Xinjiang region. They recalled on Friday their meeting with senior Olympic management last October that took five years to secure. \"They repeatedly told us that the IOC\u00b4s mission was to create a better world\" without discrimination, said Zumretay Arkin, an advocate with the Germany-based World Uyghur Congress. \"A better world to us means a free and democratic world where there are no camps, no forced labor factories, no cultural and religious repression,\" Arkin told reporters in an online briefing before Bach's media duty. The campaign has urged the IOC to move the 2022 Olympics from Beijing or for a boycott by national teams. About 100 of the 206 national Olympic teams might compete at a Winter Games. Bach is passionately against boycotts after being unable to defend his team fencing title at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. His West Germany team joined the United States in refusing to go in protest at the Soviet Union\u00b4s invasion of Afghanistan. \"Why would you punish the athletes from your own country if you have a dispute with a government from another country?\" Bach said. \"This just makes no real sense.\" A more recent history lesson is cited by \"No Beijing 2022\" -- how the IOC said China would become more open and tolerant through Beijing hosting the 2008 Olympics. \"There was a total lack of (IOC) recognition of mistakes around the 2008 Games,\" said Gloria Montgomery, of the International Tibet Network, about the October meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. If a widespread boycott is unlikely, athletes could play a role amid growing activism in sports and direct engagement with fans and sponsors. Teng Biao, a Chinese human rights lawyer, suggested Olympic athletes could show support through social media posts, wearing T-shirts with slogans, or refusing to attend the Feb. 4 opening ceremony \"We do hope the athletes and other participants at the Olympics can do something,\" he said, \"to send a message to the Chinese government and to the world.\" ___ AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          The logos for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics are seen at an exhibit at a visitors center at the Winter Olympic venues in Yanqing on the outskirts of Beijing, Friday, Feb. 5, 2021.

        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - Organizers trying to form the first union at an Amazon warehouse are getting support from another big name: Black Lives Matter. The group plans to hold an event Saturday near the warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, making it the latest high-profile supporter of the union push, which is the biggest in Amazon's nearly 30-year history. Most of the workers in the warehouse are Black, according to union organizers, and the backing from Black Lives Matter could help further legitimize the cause. Besides higher pay, organizers are also asking for more break time and for Amazon to treat workers with respect. \"Black workers have historically been the backbone of this country, its institutions, and innovations,\" said Patrisse Cullors, the executive director of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, in a statement. \"Therefore, it is fully within our rights and dignity that we be treated and compensated fairly. Just as we have the right to live, we also have the right to work.\" Nearly 6,000 workers in the Bessemer warehouse have a little more than two weeks left to vote on whether they want to unionize. A majority of voters need to vote \"yes\" to form a union. Votes will be counted starting March 30. Other high-profile supporters include Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, and Stacey Abrams, the one-time Democratic candidate for Georgia governor who has become a leading voice on voting rights. On Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, became the latest politician to back organizers.

The group plans to hold an event Saturday, March 13, 2021 near the warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, making it the latest high-profile supporter of the union push, which is the biggest in Amazon's nearly 30-year history. (AP Photo/Jay Reeves, File)  Earlier this month, President Joe Biden released a two-minute video saying workers in Alabama and around the country had the right to unionize without intimidation from their companies, but he didn't mention Amazon directly. Still, the video may be enough to push other workers to want to unionize. \"When you have a president saying that unions will help you, people can hear that,\" said Lynne Vincent, a professor at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management. More than 1,000 Amazon workers around the country have reached out to the union, according to Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is organizing the push at Bessemer. He said the union has also heard from workers at other companies who work in stores, warehouses and poultry plants. Even with high-profile support, organizers have an uphill battle. Seattle-based Amazon has a history of crushing unionization efforts at its warehouses and Whole Foods grocery stores. Plus, Alabama\u00b4s laws don\u00b4t favor unions: It is one of 27 \"right-to-work\" states where workers don\u00b4t have to pay dues to unions that represent them. Amazon\u00b4s pushback has included text messages to employees and meetings where the company tells workers the union will take money from their paycheck with little benefit. Amazon, whose profits and sales have soared during the pandemic, has previously said that it believes union organizers don\u00b4t represent the views of the majority of its employees, and that it already offers what unions want: starting pay of $15 an hour and other benefits. _____ Follow Joseph Pisani on Twitter: @ josephpisani",

Sanders said he asked the tech baron to appear at a Wednesday committee hearing to discuss the union election being held at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. The former presidential candidate said Amazon \"is currently engaged in an aggressive union-busting campaign against Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama to stop them from collectively bargaining for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.\" Among the witnesses called will be Jennifer Bates, an Amazon worker at the fulfillment center. Sanders said in a tweet that he \"invited\" Bezos \"to explain to the American people why he thinks it's appropriate for him to spend a whole lot of money denying economic dignity to workers at Amazon, while he has become $78 billion richer during the pandemic.\" Amazon did not immediately respond to an inquiry on whether Bezos, who is the world's richest person, would appear at the hearing. The hearing comes amid a contentious union drive which would, if successful, result in the first US collective bargaining unit at Amazon, which employs some 800,000 people in the United States. Celebrities and political leaders have expressed support for the union effort and President Joe Biden said last month the election should go on with \"no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.\" Sanders said he was calling the hearing on the growing crisis of wealth inequality and stated that \"during the pandemic, 664 billionaires in America have increased their wealth by $1.3 trillion.\" Amazon has said the majority of its workers did not want to join a union and has defended its policies which include a $15 minimum hourly wage. But it has created a website and distributed flyers with the slogan \"DoItWithoutDues,\" which encourage workers to vote against the labor initiative.",

        "full article": "By Daphne Psaledakis WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The State Department on Friday said Washington has decided not to lift the pause in assistance to Ethiopia for most programs in the security sector, days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described acts in Tigray as ethnic cleansing. State Department spokesman Ned Price said that while the United States has decided to resume certain types of assistance, including that related to global health and food security, assistance for other programs and most programs in the security sector would remain paused. \"Given the current environment in Ethiopia, we have decided not to lift the assistance pause for other programs, including most programs in the security sector,\" Price said at a news briefing. Blinken has pressed Ethiopia to end hostilities in Tigray and on Wednesday, testifying before Congress, he said he wanted to see forces in Tigray from Eritrea and Amhara be replaced by security forces \"that will not abuse the human rights of the people of Tigray or commit acts of ethnic cleansing, which we've seen in western Tigray.\" Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes, and there are shortages of food, water and medicine in the region of more than 5 million people. Blinken, in a call with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday, discussed the importance of an international investigation into reported human rights abuses in the region, the State Department said on Friday. It said that in the call, Blinken also called for \"enhanced regional and international efforts to help resolve the humanitarian crisis, end atrocities, and restore peace in Ethiopia.\" The U.N. said last week that Eritrean troops were operating throughout Ethiopia's northern Tigray region and reports suggested they were responsible for atrocities. The State Department last month said Washington will de-link its pause on some aid to Ethiopia from its policy on the giant Blue Nile hydropower dam that sparked a long-running dispute between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. But it cautioned that resumption of assistance would be assessed on a number of factors, including \"whether each paused program remains appropriate and timely in light of developments in Ethiopia that occurred subsequent to the pause being put in place,\" according to a State Department representative.

        "full article": "Anthony Watson will reach his Test half-century for England on Saturday but admits he is \u2018not too fussed\u2019 about that landmark. He is just glad to be motoring in the fast lane again.The Bath wing has become a more confident, assertive figure lately, and in attempting to explain the transformation, head coach Eddie Jones joked: \u2018He was driving a Daihatsu for a while and now he\u2019s back in a Maserati! That makes a difference. He goes a bit faster. Ask him about that; which car he\u2019s driving.\u2019So the question was put to Watson and when the 27-year-old stopped laughing, he said: \u2018I\u2019m actually driving neither of those but he wants me to say Maserati. It\u2019s basically a reference to how I\u2019ve been moving; whether I\u2019ve been moving fast or not.         Anthony Watson will win his 50th Test cap for England in their Six Nations clash with France         Bath wing Watson (centre), 27, has scored three tries in his last two Test matches for England\u00a0   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       The Great Summer of Sport is SELLING OUT fast: Desperate...

So he often asks me first thing in the morning, \u201cWhat car have we got today?\u201d I have to reply \u201cMaserati\u201d.\u2019Whatever vehicle he is, the engine appears to be working well. Watson has scored three tries in his last two Tests, as the primary outlet for England\u2019s best attacking moments.It has been six-and-a-half years since his debut, against the All Blacks, and he has grown up a lot in that time.\u2018When I got my first cap I was probably pretty immature,\u2019 said Watson. \u2018I was interested in a lot of other stuff besides rugby and trying to be in the limelight for not necessarily the right reasons.\u2018But as Kyle Sinckler always says to me, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep the main thing the main thing\u201d.\u2019         England head coach Eddie Jones wryly described Watson as maturing 'like a nice Pinotage'\u00a0Serious injuries forced him to focus more on his career and becoming a father last year has played a part in the maturity process, too.\u00a0Watson said: \u2018I remember being extremely upset with how I had played in one Bath game. I went home and it is less of a big deal. It still hurt me, but I was less emotionally stressed than I would have been if my son wasn\u2019t there, so from that perspective it does change you. It (rugby) is not the be-all and end-all.\u2019Jones quipped that Watson has matured \u2018like a nice Pinotage\u2019 and suggested he is now fully committed to maximising his talent. \u2018Maybe earlier in his career it came a bit too easily for him,\u2019 said the head coach.There is now a large contingent of new dads in the England squad and Jones added: \u2018They appreciate their rugby more. They are playing for their families and I think that probably matures the players a little bit.\u2019   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       The Great Summer of Sport is SELLING OUT fast: Desperate...

Upgrades also are necessary at linebacker and on the defensive line. With Mackensie Alexander and William Jackson in the free agent pool, cornerback could also be a concern. One of the franchise\u00b4s greatest players, A.J. Green, is likely to sign elsewhere as a free agent after nine seasons in Cincinnati.

The move puts the team in the red in terms of the salary cap so expect some cap cuts or moves. Guard Kevin Zeitler ($12 million) was released and tackle Nate Solder ($9.9 million salary) is another likely candidate given he also is in his early 30s. New York may sit back and find depth players in free agency. The team's biggest needs are at cornerback, a deep-threat receiver and an edge rusher.

NEEDS: The Panthers are actively in pursuit of a quarterback, and Deshaun Watson is presumably owner David Tepper\u00b4s top target should the Texans QB become available via trade. Much of what Carolina does in free agency will depend on how the Watson storyline plays out, as the Panthers would need to send multiple draft picks and existing players in return to land that type of franchise QB. Carolina has the No. 8 pick in the draft, so QB is definitely an option there. If they can't land Watson, Teddy Bridgewater would be back as a starter and potential mentor. \"Teddy is our quarterback and he's a total pro,\" GM Scott Fitterer said of Bridgewater. The Panthers used the franchise tag on Moton but still need to upgrade their offensive and defensive lines and cornerback.

Following the High Court decision and as police discussions continue, a number of MPs shared messages in support of the proposed vigils.

        "full article": "By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - A fund providing restitution to victims of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuses will resume offering payouts following a five-week halt, after receiving assurances from the late financier's estate there will be enough cash to fund payouts. Jordana Feldman, the fund's administrator, announced the immediate resumption of full operations at the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program on Friday, following the receipt of $10 million from the proceeds of recent sales of Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. The program has received more than 175 claims since being created last June, and paid out more than $67 million. Eligible victims have until March 25 to file claims. Feldman had suspended payout offers on Feb. 4, citing uncertainty about the liquidity of assets from the estate to fund payouts. The resumption came after Epstein's townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side was sold this week for $51 million, according to Daniel Weiner, a lawyer for the estate's executors. It also followed the rejection by a judge in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned two islands, of a bid by the territory's attorney general Denise George to freeze the estate's assets, saying George lacked legal standing. George had complained that the estate's assets were falling too fast, and accused the two executors of being the \"indispensable captains\" of Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. The executors rejected her misconduct allegations. Once worth $634 million, Epstein's estate was recently worth $240.8 million after paying taxes and other expenses, and contributing money to the victims' fund. Epstein signed his will on Aug. 8, 2019, two days before killing himself in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

        "full article": "For the oldest and most venerable institution in Britain, this has been a truly terrible week.When the news broke that Harry and Meghan had given an interview to Oprah Winfrey, Buckingham Palace insiders must have feared the worst.Few, though, could have imagined quite how ghastly the fallout would be.For days, the House of Windsor has seen its name dragged through the mud on TV screens across the world.Quite separate from the personal agonies of a family torn apart, our Queen and her closest relatives have been tarred as callous, antediluvian racists, with foreign columnists lining up to sneer at Britain and its Royal Family.Oceans of newspaper ink have been spilled on the nuances of the Sussexes' interview, so I don't propose to rake over the gory details again.Yet for anybody interested in our nation's past, present and future, this week's spectacle raises many questions. What will it all mean? Is this really a watershed in our relationship with our Royal Family?Does it represent the moment things turned irredeemably sour, the beginning of the end? And where on earth does the monarchy go from here?         For days, the House of Windsor (pictured: The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2016) has seen its name dragged through the mud on TV screens across the world         When the news broke that Harry and Meghan had given an interview to Oprah Winfrey (pictured: Harry and Meghan in the interview), Buckingham Palace insiders must have feared the worstLet's start with the obvious. There's no doubt that Meghan and Oprah's love-in dealt the Firm a severe blow.The Mail's YouGov poll, after the interview was aired, found that almost every royal has seen a drop in their popularity.One in three believes Meghan has been the victim of racism, and half of respondents believe the Royal Family came off badly from the interview.And although republicanism is still a minority interest, its support has risen to 29 per cent.So is this the moment when the decline of authority, the death of deference, the rise of 'wokeness' and the inexorable progress of what I see as the Americanisation of British culture fatally erode the loyalties of old?That idea strikes me as implausible, not to say entirely unwelcome. But let's indulge it for a moment.In our lifetimes, historic institutions have taken a battering. Public trust in the police, the BBC, the Church of England and other bodies has plummeted \u2014 not always undeservedly.Even before the Oprah nightmare reached our screens, young Britons were less instinctively supportive of the monarchy.Three months ago, according to another YouGov poll, just a third of those aged 18 to 24 believed the Queen played an important role as head of state.Since Monday, the generation gap has yawned still wider. Among the same age group in the Mail's poll, 48 per cent backed Meghan and Harry, while only 15 per cent sided with the senior royals.Almost two-thirds of youngsters thought the Californian exiles had been treated unfairly.All this reveals a wider story. Only if you've been living under a rock can you have failed to notice that many young Britons are suspicious of tradition, intolerant of inherited privilege and obsessed \u2014 to the point of derangement, some of us might say \u2014 with race, gender and identity politics.So it's easy to sketch a future scenario in which this week really does mark the beginning of the end.Imagine if the next few weeks bring more accusations from the Sussexes, themselves or via 'friends' carefully briefed by the former Ms Markle.         According to a new YouGov poll, one in three believes Meghan (pictured with Prince Harry in 2018) has been the victim of racism, and half of respondents believe the Royal Family came off badly from the interviewWhat if the hunt for the supposed 'racist' produces a senior name? What if there are more claims of even more scandalous goings-on in the Palace?At some point in, say, the late 2020s, the Queen leaves the stage \u2014 a moment few of us care to imagine, but sadly inevitable all the same \u2014 and Charles is proclaimed King, but there are demands for a national referendum on the monarchy.The government of the day bows to the will of the people. Enthused by an aggressive social-media campaign, pumped up by wild claims on Facebook and Twitter, encouraged by the likes of The Guardian and the BBC, young people turn out in massive numbers.And at the last minute, there is a dramatic swing towards abolition.The next day, as Charles and Camilla pack their bags, the British Republic is born. On the California coast, the stars of Netflix's latest reality show (Spreading Compassion With Meghan And Harry) exchange a smirk of satisfaction.That's the future according to the republican fantasists, anyway. And some elements of this scenario do contain a minuscule grain of sense.The monarchy does need to work harder to woo young people, and the little republican lobby is never going to vanish entirely. And, yes, the accession of King Charles will be a delicate moment.But this republican fantasy is all so improbable, isn't it?After all, the monarchy has already weathered what I consider to be far worse storms.Although the Harry and Meghan imbroglio may seem an embarrassing low point, is it really worse than Diana's Panorama interview in 1995, when she admitted to affairs and questioned Charles's suitability to be King?Or the emotional furore surrounding her death two years later when, for a moment, large parts of the population seemed to turn against the Queen?Is it worse than the Abdication Crisis of 1936? Worse than the former Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson's flirtation with the Nazis?   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Now Meghan Markle makes a formal complaint to Ofcom about...    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's popularity falls to lowest...      Share this article Share   Worse than the massive public backlash against the widowed, reclusive Victoria in the 1870s, when thousands of people joined republican rallies in Central London?Worse than the George IV's shambolic 1821 coronation, when armed soldiers barred his estranged wife, Caroline of Brunswick, from entering Westminster Abbey?Worse than her funeral three weeks later, when protesters and soldiers fought a pitched battle, and at least two demonstrators were killed?Of course not. Embarrassing as the past week has been, a bit of perspective is required. Not only have we been here before, most of us have seen it coming for years.It was blindingly obvious within months of her marriage that Meghan could barely stand life in Britain.It was also a shock to nobody that she didn't go quietly. Sooner or later there was always going to be a tell-all U.S. interview, with Prince Harry cast as the stammering captive in a hostage video.To some extent, all this was 'priced in', as financial experts put it. We knew it was coming.I have no doubt a lot of the republican loudmouths queuing up to have their say on TV this week have been practising their shocked faces for months.And perhaps this explains one of this week's most heartening features \u2014 the remarkable resilience of support for the Royal Family.For despite the pearl-clutching of the rent-a-quotes, most Britons admire the Queen, support the monarchy and (by a narrow margin) support the senior royals rather than the self- banished exiles.Indeed, even after the monarchy's worst week for more than two decades, support for a republic remains becalmed on less than 30 per cent, up by only 4 per cent since the turn of the year.Senior royals such as the Queen, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge remain far, far more popular than any politician.         Senior royals such as the Queen, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge (pictured this week) remain far, far more popular than any politicianAnd millions, I suspect, will have quietly cheered when they heard William's robust response on Thursday to a reporter who asked if the Royal Family was racist.Measured words in palace statements are all very well. But William said precisely what we needed to hear, and he didn't bother to conceal his anger at his brother's self-pitying solipsism.Looking ahead, then, it's hard to see a future without the Royal Family. How would the republican transition actually happen?When the Queen exits the stage, Charles will immediately become King. Succession is instantaneous.\u00a0For the royal story to come to a close, one of Britain's major parties \u2014 presumably Labour \u2014 would have to win an election on a republican platform, promising a national plebiscite.But that isn't remotely likely. Not even Jeremy Corbyn went to the country promising a republic, for the obvious reason that millions of his own working-class voters would reject it.Whatever Hollywood celebrities and breakfast-TV weathermen think of Harry and Meghan's performance, therefore, the royal ship will sail on.Both the Queen and Prince Charles have seen this all before. They know that if they keep calm and carry on, the squalls will eventually fade into history.In the long run I think they still have every reason for optimism.The pandemic has shown the senior royals at their best, from the Queen's moving address last spring, when she quoted the late Dame Vera Lynn, as well as her recent message urging us to get vaccinated, to William and Kate delivering food parcels, volunteering on crisis helplines and drumming up support for nurses and teachers.         Princes Harry and William together in 2018 to watch a flypast to mark the centenary of the Royal Air ForceThe summer of 2022 will bring the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, marking the 70th anniversary of her accession with a special four-day bank holiday weekend.Assuming that the worst of the pandemic is behind us, it will surely be a party to remember, reinforcing the bond between Crown and people.The royal soap opera will continue, of course. Harry and Meghan aren't going to disappear.But to pursue the TV analogy, it is the Firm that commands all the most promising storylines.In 2026, God willing, the Queen will turn 100. Her son and heir, Charles, seems more comfortable in his 70s than ever before.Her grandson, William, is approaching his 40s, and will surely take the throne as a popular, settled husband and father.As George, Charlotte and Louis grow up, there may be plenty of high jinks to come. But against this background, this is one show that seems unlikely to lose its magic.That's not to deny that the brand could do with some tweaks, as Prince Charles has reportedly argued for years.The Windsors depend on some \u00a386 million in taxpayers' money \u2014 tiny compared with most departmental budgets, but it could always be smaller.In an age when privilege has become a dirty word, the Firm could work harder to cut its costs. We British expect a sprinkling of stardust \u2014 no bicycling Scandinavians or dull Dutchmen, thank you \u2014 but we don't need their privilege rammed down our throats.Above all, they can never stress enough the virtues of humility, responsibility and love of country, which the Queen has embodied since her accession.As long as they stick to that formula, there's no reason why a lean, slimmed-down monarchy, dedicated to service rather than self, shouldn't sail into the 2030s and 2040s in pretty good health.Contrast that, though, with the outlook for the Sussexes.Where do they go from here? There's only one interview they can give to Oprah Winfrey \u2014 and we've seen it. They have shot their bolt, discharged their ultimate weapon. Now what?For all their gushing talk of spreading love, compassion and kindness in their podcasts and documentaries, it hardly strikes me as a durable business model.Even their admirers found Harry and Meghan's recent podcast excruciatingly syrupy and lacking in substance.As for their brand, well, the all-important royal seal of approval is gone for ever.For all the talk of deals with Netflix et al, they will be yesterday's news before they know it. Hollywood is not exactly renowned for its long memory.So let's imagine the position in, say, a quarter of a century's time.In the year 2046, William will probably be king, Kate at his side, leading a popular, slimmed-down, united Royal Family.George, Prince of Wales, will be 32, perhaps with young children of his own. Charlotte will be 30, Louis 27.But what of Harry and Meghan, who will be in their mid-60s? Still on the U.S. West Coast? Still churning out the Archewell podcasts?Surely not still hawking their sob stories around the breakfast shows, complaining that Archie was cheated of his birthright by a vindictive, 'racist' Royal Family.And what, I wonder, will people think in 2046, when they look back on the scandal of the past week?Will they see it as a watershed in the history of Britain's relationship with its monarchy, the moment when everything changed?Or will they see it as merely one furore among so many others: just another brief, eye-catching hullaballoo?Well, here's my answer. I think the truth is both more mundane and more reassuring. I don't think they will remember it at all.",

RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS: CBs Charvarius Ward and Alex Brown; TEs Deon Yelder and Nick Keizer; RB Darrel Williams; LB Ben Niemann; WR Byron Pringle; OL Andrew Wylie. NEEDS: The first order of business is to get under the salary cap, which could mean an extension for FS Tyrann Mathieu and restructuring the deals of several players already under long-term contracts. They already released Schwartz and Fisher, saving them more than $18 million. If they can free up some more money, they desperately need help along the offensive line - remember the Super Bowl? - along with cornerback and wide receiver. The Chiefs should get some reinforcements back in OLs Laurent Duvernay-Tardif and Lucas Niang, both of whom opted out during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they will lean heavily on the draft to fill other holes. But their success last season means they will be picking near the end of each round, and that will limit their ability to get plug-and-play rookies. And that means getting the salary cap under control is paramount so general manager Brett Veach and coach Andy Reid can at least chase some mid-level options at their biggest position needs before the April draft. AVAILABLE SALARY CAP SPACE (approximately): $4.3 million over the salary cap. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "full article": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - A National Park Service ranger used a stun gun on a man who identifies as Native American after trying repeatedly to defuse a confrontation on federal land in New Mexico, according to an internal investigation released Friday. Video of the Dec. 27 run-in drew outcry from Indigenous activists as it showed a ranger at the Petroglyph National Monument asking Darrell House for identification. Authorities said House, who identifies as Navajo and Oneida, was seen climbing on petroglyph cliff features off-trail in violation of park rules. The agency determined that the ranger\u00b4s actions were consistent with policy and appropriate given the circumstances. It also said Park Service officials met with local Indigenous leaders and others as part of an effort to strengthen cultural awareness at the monument and in the broader community. \"The National Park Service remains committed to respecting the rights and dignity of every individual. This incident provided a learning experience for us to build on how we incorporate tribal and pueblo perspectives in our everyday work,\" Park Service Regional Director Mike Reynolds said in a statement. In video that House shared on social media, the ranger asked for his identification and House responded that he was back on the trail and didn\u00b4t need to provide his ID. The ranger told House that he was refusing a lawful order and would have to be detained until he could be identified. House walked away as the ranger told him to stop. House picked up his dog in one hand and lifted his cellphone in the other and began yelling for help as he was Tased.

Video of the Dec. 27 run-in drew an outcry from Indigenous activists as it showed a ranger at the Petroglyph National Monument asking Darrell House for identification. (National Park Service via AP, File)  The video shows him screaming and rolling on the ground. The ranger repeatedly asks for him to put his hands behind his back as House raises his hands and at times folds them in front of his chest while calling for help. The Park Service had released a portion of the ranger's body camera footage showing what led up to the incident. It released more video Friday. It shows the ranger telling House that Native American tribes from the area consider Petroglyph National Monument sacred and that visitors are supposed to stay on designated trails to preserve cultural resources and allow desert vegetation to recover. The video also showed House giving the ranger a fake name and trying to walk away. House was cited for interfering with agency functions, concealing his identity and being off-trail. He's due in court later this month. House has not returned messages from The Associated Press. In social media posts at the time, he said he went to the monument to meditate. More recent posts focus on his artwork, criticism of law enforcement and the push by Native American tribes to regain their ancestral homelands. Reynolds said the Park Service will be working with New Mexico's Indigenous communities to better coordinate use of the area for ceremonial and religious purposes. That includes a plan to strengthen protection of cultural resources found in the park through a designated trail system. Agency staff recently met with the Ancestral Lands Conservation Corps about opportunities for tribal work crews, youth and families to be incorporated in park programming and projects. The Park Service said it also sought cultural awareness training for employees and guidance from the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center.

        "full article": "ST. LOUIS (AP) - A task force appointed to examine concerns about a troubled St. Louis jail is urging the city to create an independent oversight board to help oversee the lockup, according to a report released Friday. Task force leaders shared the report with Mayor Lyda Krewson. The Rev. Darryl Gray, a longtime racial justice advocate who chairs the task force, said the creation of an oversight board is an \"urgent priority.\" \"This Board should have the authority to obtain relevant information, unrestricted access to detainees and staff, adequate resources to hire external expertise, and provide on-going long-term oversight,\" Gray wrote in the report. Krewson and Public Safety Director Jimmie Edwards said in a statement that they'll review the recommendations. \"Our shared priority continues to be the health and safety of our Corrections employees and the detainees who the Courts have placed into our custody, in addition to the safety, security, and integrity of our correctional facilities like CJC,\" the statement said. Inmate frustration at the downtown City Justice Center boiled over in the predawn hours of Feb. 6, when 117 inmates got out of their cells, smashed windows, set fires and tossed chairs, a filing cabinet and other items through the broken glass onto the street four stories below. A corrections officer was briefly hospitalized.          FILE - In this Feb. 6, 2021, file photo, inmates yell from broken windows at the St. Louis Justice Center, known as the city jail, in St. Louis, Mo. Advocates for St. Louis jail inmates say the uprising at the downtown jail happened in part because detainees are worried that the jail isn't doing enough to protect them from COVID-19. Advocates say it's part of a long history of indifference toward inmates at jails in St. Louis. But city leaders say there are no cases of COVID-19 at the downtown jail. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP, File)  It was the third violent outburst at the jail since December. Edwards blamed the uprisings on \"angry, defiant, very violent people,\" but inmate advocates blamed the poor treatment of the detainees. Inmates have complained about unhealthy and inhumane conditions, and have expressed worries that the jail's COVID-19 precautions fall short. City leaders have cited coronavirus protocols that include 14-day quarantine periods for each new detainee, masks replaced upon request and testing anytime a detainee or a nurse detects symptoms. The task force also recommended more recreation time for inmates, limiting the length of stay in a holding cell to a maximum of 24 hours, faster response to medical needs, and a renewed effort to reduce legal logjams that have kept some pre-trial detainees in jail for well over a year. In addition to Gray, the nine-member task force includes two aldermen and six community members, including St. Louis NAACP President Adolphus Pruitt and former state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed.

        "full article": "TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) - Arizona Diamondbacks first base coach Dave McKay suffered a broken rib and lacerated spleen after a fall in the dugout earlier this week. Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said the 70-year-old McKay was wearing a new pair of shoes on Tuesday, tripped on the bottom step of the dugout and fell against the bench during a game against the San Francisco Giants. He quickly recovered and stayed at the park, but began to feel more pain on Wednesday morning and that's when the extent of the injury was discovered. \"He's fine, everything's good,\" Lovullo said on Friday. \"He's just going to need to step away.\" Lovullo said McKay was \"resting comfortably\" and had a \"little procedure to cauterize the spleen and everything is thumbs up right now.\" Lovullo said he expects McKay to be away from the team for about a week, but that he should be able to be with the team by opening day on April 1. McKay played in the big leagues from 1975 to 1982 with the Twins, Blue Jays and A's. He's spent more than 35 years as a coach and has been with the Diamondbacks since 2014. D-backs shortstop Nick Ahmed says he admires McKay, who is well known around the organization for his good health. \"He's a trooper, takes care of himself super well,\" Ahmed said. \"We know he's going to bounce back great.

        "title": "EXPLAINER: How will US make more shots available by May 1?",
        "full article": "President Joe Biden's promise that all of the nation's 255 million adults will be eligible for coronavirus vaccines by May 1 means the U.S. needs to move fast. Within the next seven weeks, the federal government must deliver doses to hundreds of new vaccination sites and recruit a new wave of health care workers to administer the shots. Simply distributing the vaccines will not be enough, though. The government also aims to simplify the often-frustrating sign-up process and bring shots to communities that are having the hardest time getting vaccinated. Here's how public health officials intend to meet the president's deadline and the challenges that lie ahead. ___ WHAT WILL HAPPEN MAY 1?          FILE - In this Dec. 29, 2020, file photo, Penny Cracas, with the Chester County, Pa., Health Department, fills a syringe with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine before administering it to emergency medical workers and healthcare personnel at the Chester County Government Services Center in West Chester, Pa. President Joe Biden's pledge that all U.S. adults will be eligible for coronavirus vaccines by May 1, 2021, is putting a new challenge in front of the nation. For that to happen, the federal government must deliver doses to hundreds of new vaccination sites and recruit more health care workers to administer the shots. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File)  That's the date that Biden wants states to make all adults eligible for the vaccines, but it does not mean everyone will be able to get a shot immediately or even soon after. White House officials expect enough doses to be available for everyone by the end May. How quickly the shots are given will depend on establishing hundreds of new vaccination sites and other distribution points. Some states will move at a faster pace. Michigan's governor said Friday that all adults will be eligible for vaccines beginning in early April. Alaska this week became the first state to open up to anyone 16 or older. ___ IS THE GOAL REALISTIC? The May 1 goal is reasonable, and the administration may be using it to urge states and communities to prepare to administer a lot more vaccine, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former FDA deputy commissioner and a Johns Hopkins professor. \"The problem is, if you\u00b4re just waiting to see how much vaccine you have before you schedule the clinic, then you\u00b4re building in a lot of delays,\" he said. \"To say, `Look, we\u00b4re going to be able to vaccinate everyone, every adult who wants it,\u00b4 that\u00b4s sending a signal to everyone: `Get ready.\u00b4\" ___ HOW WILL OFFICIALS HANDLE THE BIG INCREASE? The Biden administration is counting on expanding the number of large drive-thru vaccination sites and neighborhood centers. It plans to double the number of federally run mass-vaccination locations and double the number of retail pharmacies enrolled in the federal distribution program to more than 20,000. It also will add more mobile clinics and send doses to community health centers to reach under-served and hard-hit communities. ___ WHO WILL GIVE THE SHOTS? Getting millions of doses into the arms of adults will not be possible without a big increase in the number of health care workers and volunteers. Biden's plan calls for allowing veterinarians, dentists, optometrists, midwives, physician assistants, medical students and others to administer the shots. The president also says 4,000 more active-duty troops will be brought in to help with the vaccination efforts. That's in addition to 2,000 who already are assisting. ___ HOW WILL THEY REACH EVERYONE? People in hard-hit communities and low-income neighborhoods have been falling through the cracks because of language barriers, lack of transportation and lack of access to online registration, among other obstacles. Mistrust of the vaccine also plays a role. The Biden administration\u00b4s plan is to put more doses closer to where people live through mobile clinics and by sending vaccines directly to another 700 community health centers, bringing the total to 950. \"We're ensuring that equity remains at the center of our response,\" said Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, chair of the White House\u00b4s COVID-19 equity task force. WHAT DO PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS SAY? Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said guidance from the White House, conversations with manufacturers and a review of other data indicates that there will be \"a huge increase\" in the number of vaccines available to the American people over the next month. Right now, there\u00b4s still not enough supply, he said. But by late April and early May, the supply will exceed demand. \"Certainly by May, if not earlier, we\u00b4re going to have plenty of vaccine for anybody who wants it,\" he said. Jha said the country currently has the capacity to give 2.5 million to 3 million shots per day, and now states need to be working to make sure they have distribution capacity and can vaccinate at a national rate of 4 million to 5 million a day. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE SIGN-UP FRUSTRATIONS? Securing a slot to get the vaccine has been maddening for many. And that's with only a sliver of the population eligible. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that about 4 in 10 Americans think the process has been poor. Biden says his administration will have a nationwide website up and running by May 1 to show people where the vaccine is can be found. There will be a phone center available by that time too to assist with tracking down doses. The federal government will also work with local agencies to improve their sign-up sites. The president says the goal is \"no more searching day and night for an appointment.\" ___ WHERE DOES THE VACCINATION EFFORT STAND RIGHT NOW? More than 100 million Americans have already received at least one shot, and nearly 66 million are fully vaccinated. Many more will have received shots by May 1, somewhat alleviating the bottleneck that expanded eligibility is likely to create. ___ WHAT\u00b4S THE ENDGAME? Biden is targeting the Fourth of July as the date when the nation could mark significant progress. But he tempered his optimism by warning that getting there will rely on people following public health guidelines and getting vaccinated soon after they are eligible. ___ Associated Press Writer Michelle R.

Because for three long months last year the closest she came to seeing them \u2014 the youngest then just three \u2014 was through glass patio doors.For fear of endangering her family through her vital work as an acute care nurse, in the first lockdown Rachel sent her daughters to live with her parents. And although her parents only lived across the road, it may as well have been miles for all she would see of them.It was last Mother's Day when her four daughters \u2014 Sophie, ten, Olivia, eight, Hannah, six, and Evelyn, four \u2014 left to live with their nana Carol, a retired bookkeeper, and granddad Gary, a retired policeman, both in their 60s.         Covid-19 nurse\u00a0Rachel Sutcliffe was unable to hug her daughters for three months as she helped treat people battling the virus. The closest she came to seeing them \u2014 the youngest then just three \u2014 was through glass patio doors'Sending them off with their little suitcases was heartwrenching,' says Rachel, a single mum in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.'I explained Mummy had to work more because of all the poorly people and couldn't be with them for a few days.'Because in truth, Rachel didn't know then how long they would be apart \u2014 nor how hard she would find it.'I cried every day. I had no idea how much I'd crave all those little Mum things like being able to cuddle them and kiss them goodnight. I even took their teddies to bed with me because they smelt of my girls.'But as a nurse with 16 years' experience, Rachel knew her skills were sorely needed. And as a single mum, the family rely entirely on her income.'I couldn't let my colleagues and patients down,' she says. 'Yet I felt terribly guilty, both for my girls and for my parents. Mum and Dad also foster two children, so they ended up with six children in a three-bedroom house.'The moment she got in from her 12-hour night shifts, Rachel would FaceTime her daughters. 'Every day they asked: 'Can we come home soon?' It hurt but I just had to keep saying: 'Soon.''They put notes on my car that I'd find on my way to work, saying: 'We love you, Mummy. We're so proud of you.'Three times a week, Rachel stood in her parents' back garden and waved to the girls through the patio doors. 'Sometimes that made it even harder. Evelyn would try and open the door. I would put my palm against hers on the glass and go home and sob.'Rachel's agonising decision proved to be the right one, however. In late April, she tested positive for Covid. Her breathing became laboured; her oxygen levels plummeted so low she had to be taken to hospital.'I didn't tell the children I was sick because they would have been terrified.'After a day in hospital and six weeks at home recuperating, Rachel returned to the frontline in May.Only in June, when cases began to fall, did Rachel feel safe having the girls home.The reunion was magical. 'As soon as the girls saw me, they pelted into my arms. We all cried. They spent the evening cuddling me and stroking my hair.Although Evelyn was clingy for a few weeks, Rachel is convinced the girls have suffered no ill effects. So much so that they went to live with her parents again in November when cases rose.As for being crowned Inspirational Mother of the Year, Rachel is characteristically modest: 'But I just did what all mums do. I put my children first. I missed them a million times a day. But I'm so proud of them and so grateful to my own wonderful mum.'\u00a0 The crafty queen with six to teach at home\u00a0It's easy to imagine how people reacted when they heard Deborah Bowers-Street was homeschooling her six children \u2014 and looking after her five-month-old baby.'People are aghast when I tell them I was surprisingly calm,' says Deborah, 43, the director of a building company who lives in Havant, Hampshire, with her partner Simon, 41, an electrician.Deborah, who also owns Bramble Crafts, a business selling crafting templates and software, and had to juggle her own work around homeschooling, admits to having a secret weapon: 'I taught the children from a young age to make their own meals. They also each have one chore per day.'         Deborah Bowers-Street said she stayed 'surprisingly calm,' despite juggling her own business with homeschooling six childrenBetween them the children \u2014 Mollie, 16, Kinsie, 15, Matthew, 13, Sophie, 12, Aleana, eight, Aurora, seven \u2014 managed the vacuuming, loading and unloading the dishwasher, washer and tumble drier.All six children would come downstairs for breakfast at 8am, start schoolwork at 9am and finish at 3pm.'I'm very lucky my older four kids are smart, studious and happy to work independently' says Deborah, also mum to five-month-old Grace.Mollie is at college studying A-levels in psychology and sociology and a BTEC in health and social care, so had assignments to complete, while the other three elder children are at secondary school, with work set online together with live lessons.In testament to Deborah's care and finely tuned routine, the children thrived at home.

        "full article": "By Ted Hesson and Jarrett Renshaw WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials will limit the information they share with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to try to persuade more parents and relatives of unaccompanied migrant children to come forward and take the minors into custody, U.S. officials said on Friday during a call with reporters. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and ICE will roll back an April 2018 information-sharing agreement between the agencies as part of U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to deal with a rising number of children arriving at the border, the officials said. Immigrant advocates had criticized the agreement, saying it discouraged potential sponsors from coming forward due to fears they or their family members could be deported. \"This makes really clear that this administration prioritizes uniting a child with their family member or sponsor,\" one official said on the call. The number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has climbed in recent months as Biden, a Democrat, has reversed some of the restrictive policies put in place by former President Donald Trump, a Republican. More than 3,600 migrant children were being held in U.S. border facilities as of Thursday morning, a U.S. official told Reuters, more than four times the number in late February. The increase signals a growing humanitarian and political crisis for the Biden administration seven weeks into his presidency. Biden faces pressure from Republicans and some Democrats to address the rising border arrests, but his administration does not currently plan to seek additional funding from Congress, another one of the officials said on Friday. HHS will continue to share sponsors' home addresses with ICE through a discharge form related to a child's immigration court case, according to three people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and HHS have signed a new agreement governing how information related to unaccompanied minors can be shared, DHS said in a news release on Friday. The new agreement drops a Trump-era provision that had required U.S. health officials to share the fingerprints of sponsors with ICE. Krish O\u00b4Mara Vignarajah, president of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which operates shelters for unaccompanied minors, said in a written statement that the fingerprinting policy had \"a significant chilling effect\" on the willingness of sponsors to come forward.

        "full article": "BOGOTA, March 12 (Reuters) - An international court has dismissed a lawsuit for 4.8 trillion pesos ($1.3 billion) filed by Spanish company Naturgy against Colombia over the seizure of its subsidiary Electricaribe, the Andean country's government said on Friday. Colombia's Superintendency of Domiciliary Public Services took possession of Electricaribe from Naturgy - previously known as Gas Natural - in late 2016, citing risks the company would default and its inability to provide services across an extensive area in the north of the country. Naturgy subsequently began arbitration proceedings in 2017 to recover Electricaribe or receive compensation. Last September, Colombia's government handed over control of Electricaribe to Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) and the consortium Energia de la Costa, which is made up of Empresa de Energia de Pereira - EnerPereira - and Latin American Capital Corp. \"Today the international arbitration tribunal ruled in Colombia's favor and totally rejected Gas Natural's claims. Thanks to this decision, Colombia will not have to pay a single peso,\" Colombia's Ministry of Mines and Energy said in a statement. Naturgy was not immediately available to comment on the ruling. Naturgy chose to seek arbitration before the U.N. Commission on International Trade Law Tribunal, rather than the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which it could have chosen on the basis of a reciprocal investment protection agreement between Spain and Colombia.

        "full article": "BERLIN (AP) - Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach captain Lars Stindl missed a penalty and the team\u00b4s losing streak stretched to six games across all competitions at Augsburg in a 3-1 Bundesliga defeat on Friday. Gladbach has lost every game since the club announced that coach Marco Rose will be joining league rival Borussia Dortmund next season. The latest defeat will strengthen fans\u00b4 calls to let him go before Tuesday's Champions League game against Manchester City. Gladbach has a two-goal deficit to make up against City from the first leg of their last-16 tie. \"We'd rather have a week's training to prepare for the core tasks at the moment, namely points in the Bundesliga,\" said Rose, whose team looks likely to lose further ground in the race for European qualification places. Stindl\u00b4s penalty miss was the visitors\u00b4 biggest chance in a first half that they dominated. Raphael Framberger conceded the spot kick in the 37th minute for a foul on Marcus Thuram, but Stindl shot to the left of the goal.

(Matthias Balk/dpa via AP)  \"The penalty miss is on my head,\" Stindl said. \"I feel sorry for the guys because we always invested so much and simply didn't get any reward.\" Gladbach was to rue the miss early in the second half when Ruben Vargas arrived with pace and powered home a header from a corner. \"Despite the goal we didn't hide, but we still believed in ourselves,\" Stindl said. Gladbach had had 65% possession and 16 goal efforts to the home team\u00b4s seven. But Marco Richter scored against the run of play in the 76th with only Augsburg\u00b4s third shot on target, and Andr\u00e9 Hahn confirmed his former team\u00b4s fate on a counterattack in the 89th. \"It's so bitter,\" Gladbach scorer Florian Neuhaus said. \"It's getting on my nerves I have to say.\" Rose's team remained 10th.

The\u00a0 [Jalisco New Generation Cartel] also has influence over the busiest port in Mexico, the Port of Manzanillo, and utilizes that influence for the distribution of large quantities of drugs.'\u00a0 The nine cartels that control the US drug market\u00a0 Sinaloa CartelFounded in 1989 by H\u00e9ctor Palma, Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n and Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, the Sinaloa Cartel today stands as one of the most established transnational drug trafficking organizations. While it has carved out a presence in 15 of the 32 Mexican states, the cartel also expanded its operations into the United States, Europe, Asia and South America.With El Chapo in prison, the cartel has been plagued by internal fighting between Zambada and three of El Chapo's four sons, known as 'Los Chapitos'.The Drug Enforcement Administration views the Sinaloa Cartel as one of the top two criminal organizations along with its rival, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.The DEA said the Sinaloa Cartel 'exports and distributes wholesale amounts of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana in the United States by maintaining distribution hubs in various cities.'How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'Illicit drugs distributed by the Sinaloa Cartel are primarily smuggled into the United States\u00a0through crossing points located along the [south west border]. The cartel employs gatekeepers assigned to Ports Of Entry and controls Arizona and California area smuggling corridors into the United States.'\u00a0 Jalisco New Generation CartelThe Jalisco New Generation Cartel was once allied to the Sinaloa Cartel as El Chapo depended on its firepower to combat Los Zetas.Commandeered by Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera, the group set itself apart from other cartels in the country butchering its enemies and today is considered by the Mexican government as the most dangerous group in the country.The Jalisco New Generation Cartel is spread out across 23 of the Mexico's 32 states and currently finds itself at war with at least ten cartels.The group has been known to have increased the power that its members have by purchasing military weapons and parts from the United States.The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, according to the DEA, specializes 'in\u00a0manufacturing and distributing large amounts of fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine.'How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'The CJNG smuggles illicit drugs into the United States by accessing various trafficking corridors in northern Mexico along the SWB including Tijuana, Juarez, and Nuevo Laredo. The CJNG also has influence over the busiest port in Mexico, the Port of Manzanillo, and utilizes that influence for the distribution of large quantities of drugs.'\u00a0 Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva OrganizationFor a while, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization [BLO] was born out of the Sinaloa Cartel and became one of the most powerful cartels in Mexico led by the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva brothers: Marcos Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo, Mario Alberto and H\u00e9ctor.The Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization was involved in a deadly war with the Sinaloa Cartel after the brothers accused their cousin, El Chapo, of being responsible for the January 2008 arrest of Alfredo. The brothers retaliated by reportedly plotting the murder of El Chapo's 22-year-old son, \u00c9dgar Guzm\u00e1n, in May 2008.Alfredo's arrest sparked one of the worst periods in Mexico's war on drugs as the BLO's new ally, the Juar\u00e9z Cartel, went to war with the Sinaloa Cartel in Ciudad Juar\u00e9z, a border town across from Texas.The BLO also expanded its might by going toe-to-toe with the Gulf Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel and La Familia Cartel in the northeastern border city of Reynosa.While the cartel remains viable today, the organization's members over time split into 11 factions.How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'BLO relies on its loose alliances with larger cartels for access to drug smuggling corridors along the [south west border].'\u00a0 Los Zetas and the Cartel del Noreste [Northeast Cartel]\u00a0Los Zetas were created by Mexican military deserters who formed an alliance with the Gulf Cartel in 1999 and based its operations in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, across from Laredo, Texas. The group quickly carved out a named for itself through its savage killings. By 2010, Los Zetas split from the Gulf Cartel.Los Zetas at one point dominated more cities across Mexico than the Sinaloa Cartel, with whom it clashed amidst a threat from the Gulf Cartel to eliminate it completely.Like some of the other Mexican cartels, Los Zetas saw some of its members split and form their own groups.Los Zetas role play in the drug trade is enforced by one of its factions, the Cartel del Noreste [Northeast Cartel]. Together, the criminal groups have set up its small, but lucrative, drug trade business into the Texas border cities of Laredo and Eagle Pass while controlling routes and turfs in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Coahuila, San Luis Potos\u00ed and Zacatecas.How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'Members smuggle the majority of their illicit drugs through the [south west border] in the areas of Laredo, Texas; Eagle Pass, Texas; and the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and parts of Tamaulipas.'\u00a0 Guerrero UnidosOperating in central Mexico, the Guerrero Unidos broke away from the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization and formed an alliance with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel to traffic drugs into the United States and bring back its profits into Mexico.\u00a0The cartel is accused of being behind the September 2014 disappearance of 43 students, who were kidnapped by local police in Iguala, a city in the southern state of Guerrero.\u00a0How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'The cartel has a working partnership with the CJNG and uses the same transportation networks to move drug shipments into the United States and to return drug proceeds back to Mexico.'\u00a0 Gulf CartelThe Gulf Cartel is considered to be one of the oldest active criminal organizations in Mexico and is believed to have close ties to other gangs in\u00a0Europe, West Africa, Asia, Central America, South America, and the United States.The organization started off by smuggling alcohol into the United States during the Prohibition Era. It was not until the 1980 that it got itself immersed into the drug trade.The DEA believes the Gulf Cartel has been working closely with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel as it ships heroin and cocaine to the Texas border cities of McAllen\u00a0and Brownsville.How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'The Gulf Cartel focuses its drug trafficking activities on heroin and cocaine by transporting loads into the United States near the McAllen and Brownsville, Texas, areas.'\u00a0 Juar\u00e9z Cartel and La Linea\u00a0The Juar\u00e9z Cartel cemented itself as one of the mayor players in the drug trade business back in the 1970s. It founder, Amado Carrillo, was known as 'El Se\u00f1or de los Cielos' or 'The Lord of the Skies' due to the massive fleet of planes he owned to transport drugs, especially cocaine from Colombia and other countries in Latin America.The cartel was once allied to El Chapo before that relationship fell apart after the notorious drug lord declined to pay the Juar\u00e9z Cartel for the right to use its drug smuggling routes.The Juar\u00e9z Cartel has depended on its armed wing, La L\u00ednea, to transport\u00a0heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas.How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'These cartels' greatest territorial influence is in the state of Chihuahua near the [south west border]. This area has profitable smuggling opportunities between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas.'\u00a0 \u00a0La Familia MichoacanaLa Familia Michoacana was once linked to the Gulf Cartel before it went on its own in 2006.\u00a0\u00a0Between 2009 and 2010, the cartel proposed to the Mexican government that it had plans of laying down its arms as long as its home state of Michoac\u00e1n was granted protection. However, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n shot down their offer, which led to the cartel becoming increasingly involved in the funding of political candidates.\u00a0La Familia Michoacana today maintains a relationship with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and other criminal groups as part of its drug smuggling operation.How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'LFM has some ties to the CJNG and also works with other smaller groups to further the cartel's drug trafficking activities.'\u00a0 Los Rojos\u00a0Just like Guerreros Unidos, Los Rojos was formed as an armed wing and broke away from the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization.According to a 2020 Congressional report, Los Rojos 'operates in Guerrero and relies heavily on kidnapping and extortion for revenue as well as trafficking cocaine, although analysts dispute the scope of its involvement in the drug trade.'\u00a0How they get drugs into the US:\u00a0'Los Rojos is involved in heroin trafficking' Advertisement",

Gladbach, who face Manchester City on Tuesday in their Champions League last-16 return leg trailing 2-0, have now lost six straight games in all competitions since coach Marco Rose announced late last month his departure at the end of the season to join Borussia Dortmund. Gladbach, without a win in the Bundesliga in seven games now, were the better team in the first half and deserved a goal but wasted several good chances, including when captain Lars Stindl sent his 38th minute penalty wide. Augsburg went in front when Ruben Vargas headed in at the near post in the 52nd minute but Gladbach drew level through Florian Neuhaus 16 minutes later. Their joy lasted until the 76th minute when Marco Richter stabbed in the winner for the hosts. Andre Hahn then added a third goal by completing a quick break in the 89th with a superb chip over keeper Yann Sommer. Gladbach's hopes of playing European football next season are all but gone with the team on 33 points, six behind Borussia Dortmund who are in sixth place which leads to Europa League qualification.

        "full article": "By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The blue-chip Dow powered to its fifth consecutive record high on Friday and the S&amp;P 500 closed slightly higher as investors bought shares that should benefit from a strong reopening of the U.S. economy, an outlook signaled by rising yields in the bond market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled after rebounding more than 6% over the past three sessions as the rising bond yields revived inflation worries and dulled the appeal of high-growth technology shares. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly percentage gains since early February after President Joe Biden signed into law on Thursday one of the largest U.S. fiscal stimulus bills and data reinforced convictions the economy was headed to a high-growth recovery. The recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields has raised fears of a sudden tapering of monetary stimulus and put downward pressure on Wall Street in recent weeks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit 1.642% on Friday, the highest level since February of last year. Boeing Co rose 6.82% to lead the Dow and S&amp;P 500 higher. The rising Dow and tumbling Nasdaq reflect an ongoing sell-off in tech as investors buy cyclical and underpriced value stocks that are expected to do well as the economy recovers. For tech stocks to continue to flourish you need low rates, and in effect slower growth, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC. But with the stimulus package the economy is likely to expand 7% to 9% this year and pressure interest rates, he said. \"That's why you're seeing rates rise today because the reopening is happening faster and stronger than anticipated. And that's when value and cyclicals and economically sensitive stocks outperform,\" Hayes said. The speedy distribution of vaccines and more fiscal aid have spurred concerns of rising inflation despite assurances from the Federal Reserve to maintain an accommodative policy. All eyes will be on the central bank's policy meeting next week for further cues on inflation. U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year, a survey by the University of Michigan showed on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 293.05 points, or 0.9%, to close at 32,778.64 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 4 points, or 0.10%, to 3,943.34. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 78.81 points, or 0.59%, to end at 13,319.87. For the week, the S&amp;P rose 2.6%, the Dow added 4.1% and the Nasdaq gained 3.1%. For the Dow it was its biggest weekly gain since November. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.64 billion shares. The Nasdaq has been particularly hit by the sell-off in recent weeks and confirmed a correction at the start of the week as investors swapped richly valued technology stocks with those of energy, mining and industrial companies that are poised to benefit more from an economic rebound. Value stocks added about 0.80%, while growth stocks slumped 0.62% in a continuation of a rotation that began late last year. The high-flying but yield-sensitive group of stocks including of Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and Microsoft Corp, which fueled the past's year rally, fell. Tech, communication services and consumer discretionary indexes, which house these mega-cap stocks, slipped the most among major S&amp;P sectors. The bank index jumped 1.83%, while financials and industrials clinched new record levels. Ulta Beauty Inc fell 8.4% after the cosmetics retailer forecast annual revenue below estimates, as demand for make-up products were under pressure due to extended work-from-home policies. U.S.-listed shares of China-based JD.com Inc slid 6.7% after three sources said the company is in talks to buy part or all of a stake in brokerage Sinolink Securities worth at least $1.5 billion.

        "title": "GRAINS-Storms forecast for U.S. Plains drive wheat to one-month low",
        "full article": "By Julie Ingwersen CHICAGO, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures extended losses on Friday, touching a one-month low as rain and snow forecast for dry parts of the U.S. Plains improved production prospects, analysts said. Soybean futures finished narrowly mixed, caught between surging soyoil futures amid tightening world vegetable oil supplies, and slowing demand for soymeal, a hog feed ingredient. Corn prices ended little changed ahead of the weekend. Chicago Board of Trade May wheat settled down 4 cents at $6.38-1/2 per bushel after dipping to $6.37-1/2, its lowest since Feb. 12. Wheat futures fell as a winter storm was expected to bring snow, rain and high winds through Sunday to the Rocky Mountains and Plains. Winter wheat should benefit from the moisture as the crop emerges from dormancy and begins its key growth phase. \"Wheat prices reflect expectations for improving weather here in the States, along with soft export demand and weak seasonal signals,\" Arlan Suderman, StoneX chief commodities economist, said in a client note. CBOT May corn settled up 1/2 cent at $5.39 a bushel. In the soy complex, May soybeans ended down 1/4 cent at $14.13-1/4 a bushel while soyoil futures set life-of-contract highs and rival Malaysian palm oil futures hit a 13-year top. Meanwhile, CBOT May soymeal fell below its 100-day moving average, triggering sell-stops, on fears that disease outbreaks in China's huge hog herd will hurt demand for the feed ingredient. Soybean and corn futures were underpinned by uncertainty about the size of the harvests in South America, with dry conditions threatening Argentina's crops and wet weather slowing Brazil's soy harvest. \"We are still trying to get our arms around what is happening in Latin America,\" said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co. in Chicago. The Buenos Aires Grains Exchange this week lowered its estimate of Argentina's soybean harvest to 44 million tonnes and its corn forecast to 45 million tonnes, below its previous forecasts of 46 million tonnes for each crop. But several forecasters have increased estimates for Brazil's ongoing soybean harvest, despite rain delays.

        "full article": "Gerhardus Van Wyk will be laid to rest on Wednesday morning after a service at the Dutch Reformed kerk in the little Namibian bush town of Outjo.Were it not for the coronavirus pandemic, hundreds of mourners would be expected to attend the funeral. Burly, bearded Mr Van Wyk was a popular figure in the remote north of Namibia, in southern Africa. A 'gentle giant', several friends have told the Mail.He had led a life filled with great danger. As a young man during the Angolan Bush War (which raged from 1966 to 1990), he fought Soviet-backed guerrillas while serving in the apartheid-era South African Army. Later, as a park ranger and game-reserve manager, he battled poachers armed with assault rifles and faced charging elephants. He was a noted horseman.A sudden, violent death was perhaps not out of keeping with this colourful past. But no one could have predicted the manner in which Van Wyk met his end aged 54: shot dead at a domestic barbecue last month, it is alleged, by his billionaire British boss, Harvey Boulter.         Gerhardus Van Wyk (pictured) will be laid to rest on Wednesday morning after a service at the Dutch Reformed kerk in the little Namibian bush town of OutjoIt is said he was killed after an argument over a sex-for-accommodation 'indecent proposal' that Boulter allegedly made concerning Van Wyk's pretty daughter-in-law.'Thirty years after surviving the war, you don't expect to die like that,' says a former army comrade.The tragedy for the Van Wyk family is only the latest twist in Harvey Boulter's enigmatic life.He is the Sussex-born investment and defence industries tycoon who gave tens of thousands of pounds to Ukip election campaigns and blew the whistle on a Westminster political scandal which led to the resignation of Tory defence secretary Dr Liam Fox a decade ago.For the past two years, Boulter, 51, has been living (almost full-time, according to locals) on the 66,000-acre Kaross estate near the hamlet of Kamanjab in northern Namibia, which he bought in 2012 to indulge his love of big-game hunting. This week, Namibian police confirmed that Boulter had been charged with Mr Van Wyk's murder and he was denied bail by a magistrate in Outjo.But last night, his whereabouts were unclear. One official source said he was in custody at Outjo police station. Another said he was still being treated for minor injuries \u2014 sustained in the fatal incident \u2014 at a private hospital in the Namibian capital Windhoek, an eight-hour drive away. A third source suggested he had been discharged after treatment and was holed up at a luxury lodge.         A sudden, violent death was perhaps not out of keeping with this colourful past. But no one could have predicted the manner in which Van Wyk met his end aged 54: shot dead at a domestic barbecue last month, it is alleged, by his billionaire British boss, Harvey Boulter (pictured)One legal source indicated that Boulter claims he fired in self-defence, having been attacked by Van Wyk and his son.The Mail's investigation has suggested that the Briton was a problem drinker who wore a 9mm semi-automatic pistol in a shoulder holster 24 hours a day.The boundaries of his farm were protected by high-tech movement sensors, CCTV cameras and other defences. No one quite understood why he was so security-conscious.Friends of the dead man claim Boulter is now being 'treated with kid gloves' because of his close relationship with members of Namibia's government. They fear he might escape justice.The lawyer representing the Van Wyk family told the Mail yesterday that, while Boulter's British passport had been seized by the authorities, he still possessed several other passports, having lived in a number of countries since he left the UK.There is an unmanned private airstrip next to his farm 'from which he has gone in and out as he pleased,' says a source.'If this ever gets to trial it will be a sensation. It will shine a light on the super-rich expat life here, like the White Mischief case did in Kenya,' said another southern African, referring to the murder of the Earl of Erroll in East Africa in 1941, which led to a high-profile, inconclusive court case, as well as a 1987 film starring Charles Dance. (Many people the Mail spoke to are afraid to be named, as they think Boulter is highly influential.)But it could also serve to illuminate the recent business dealings of the combative, controversial and secretive tycoon, who according to local legal sources has been providing military equipment to the Namibian police and defence force as well as rare species for the guns of wealthy foreign hunters.White mischief, indeed.So what happened on the night of February 27, when Mr Van Wyk was killed?The events unfolded during a Saturday spit braai \u2014 a traditional whole-roast barbecue \u2014 which Boulter regularly held at Kaross.Van Wyk and his wife Alta were there. For many years, he had worked as a game ranger at the nearby Etosha National Park.'He was really a special kind of ranger,' says a long-time friend. 'And he was very famous for his horse skills.'The source thought Van Wyk had got the job at Kaross through Boulter's South African-born then wife and mother of his three teenage children, Leonorah.'Harvey called him his estate manager, which made Gerhard laugh because he was a down-to-earth game ranger,' said the friend. 'But Gerhard turned [Kaross] into one of the best farms out there in the wild west of Namibia. It's an absolute game paradise.'   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       South Africa's Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, 72, who made...

The son also worked for Boulter.Boulter, who was acrimoniously divorced from Leonorah in 2019, had recently agreed that the newly married couple could build a home on his vast estate. This deal led to alleged murder.Boulter had been drinking heavily, which was not unusual. It has been reported that the catalyst for the argument was Boulter's alleged outrageous suggestion at the barbecue that, in return for her new marital home, Liani would have to have sex with him every other night. Understandably, her husband was not pleased. There was a heated argument. Boulter produced his gun.'Harvey apparently insulted Van Wyk's daughter-in-law, became aggressive and threatened the family with a pistol,' Chief Inspector Paavo Iyambo is reported to have said. 'Van Wyk tried to keep the peace, intervened and tried to take the pistol away from Harvey.'In the scuffle that followed, a shot was fired. The bullet hit Boulter's hand and entered Van Wyk's stomach.Kaross is far from anywhere. You can't just call an ambulance.         Van Wyk's son, Gerhardus Van Wyk Jr, was present, along with his new bride Liani (pictured together). The son also worked for BoulterAlta Van Wyk, Gerhardus Jr and Liani got the grievously wounded Mr Van Wyk into the family car and drove towards Outjo State Hospital, more than 100 miles away on a country road often crossed by large animals. It must have been a hellish journey \u2014 and increasingly heartbreaking. They had almost made it to Outjo when Mr Van Wyk died in the car.Pastor Lukas Coetzer, who had known Mr Van Wyk for 30 years and will officiate at his funeral next week, told the Mail: 'The circumstances of his death are hard to understand because he wasn't aggressive. So I couldn't believe the news. At first, I thought it must be a hunting accident.'He added: 'I've met with Alta and will meet her again before the funeral, when the family from South Africa and other parts of Namibia arrive on Monday. The process is still very raw.'The tragedy is that Alta and Gerhard gave their whole life to Boulter's farm. He was totally devoted to serving Harvey.'Another old friend of the dead man told the Mail last night: 'Alta's in a hell of a state. He died in her arms and now they've lost everything. They've got to leave the farm.'So who is Harvey Boulter, the man at the centre of all this?After graduating from Bristol University, he joined the Swiss banking giant UBS. While there, he advised the Ministry of Defence on restructuring and is reported to have received top-level security clearance. After leaving UBS he struck out on his own, founding the private equity company Porton Group, which is based in the tax-haven Cayman Islands.This venture would make Boulter very rich. He was based in Hong Kong for 17 years, then moved to Dubai and the U.S. before settling in southern Africa. Along the way, he attracted a lot of attention.It was in Dubai that Boulter sought out and then brought down then-Defence Secretary Liam Fox.The tycoon had fallen into a legal dispute in America with another company and wanted the UK government help. He was told to contact the Tory minister's young gatekeeper Adam Werritty, whom Boulter thought at first was Fox's official MoD adviser. In 2011, there was a Werrity-brokered meeting with Fox on the 41st floor of a hotel in Dubai.Boulter came to realise that Werrity was not employed by the MoD. Rather, he was Fox's close friend \u2014 indeed, had been best man at his wedding \u2014 and had his own business interests. Even so, he had accompanied the defence secretary on 18 overseas visits, his expenses paid for by private donors.         So who is Harvey Boulter, the man at the centre of all this? He is pictured with the Clintons in the USWhen Boulter made this strange arrangement public \u2014 and suggested they had even discussed the knighthood that was to be given to the boss of the firm with which he was in dispute \u2014 Fox was forced to resign.The animus between the men did not end there. Boulter gave \u00a330,000 to the Ukip candidate who stood against Fox in North Somerset, while Fox sued Boulter for libel in relation to remarks the tycoon had made about him to Sky TV and in emails, questioning his integrity.In 2014, the case was settled before it went to trial, with Boulter having to apologise and pay Fox damages and legal costs.There was further controversy in 2015, when a group of unhappy investors in Boulter's firm Porton Capital took legal action, accusing him of mishandling \u00a3400 million of their money. Boulter denied any wrongdoing and the case came to nothing.Otherwise his life seemed idyllic. His wife Leonorah gave an interview in Dubai about the \u00a318 million home they had developed in the exclusive Emirates Hills neighbourhood: 'We lived in Hong Kong, which is very tropical and surrounded by mountains and greenery,' she said. 'When we moved to Dubai, which is a desert landscape, we wanted to create a little piece of the Tropics here.'Boulter drove a Rolls-Royce (he also had a Ferrari, which he raced), sailed an 80-metre yacht and owned a private jet.In 2016 ,they moved from the Middle East to Washington DC.But their marriage didn't last. This week, a neighbour of Leonorah's late parents in South Africa told the Mail: 'Her mother told me Leonorah couldn't handle Harvey's philandering any more, so she divorced him and left with the kids. They are living in America still.'After the break-up, Boulter spent more and more time at his Namibian farm.Uwe Hoth, who sold Kaross and the adjoining property to Boulter, told the Mail he first heard of the billionaire in mid-2012, when a helicopter flew at low level over their property. Uwe and his wife Tammy were running a lion rehabilitation programme on the farm.Boulter then contacted them and offered to buy their land. He wanted to turn Kaross into an exclusive hunting farm.Documents show the estate was bought through a Boulter-controlled company. Since then, Boulter has funded several local philanthropic enterprises \u2014 but he has also won a reputation as a very tough man to do business with.'Harvey is a bully who used his money to get anything and everything,' said Mr Hoth, 65. 'He told me once: 'I love taking people to court because I can. The bigger the opponent, the better for me.' 'Another local who had dealings with Boulter called him a 'cheap c***' for his aggressive approach to driving down costs that had already been agreed.But he has friends in high places. Locals say he is close to the former Minister of Defence Erkki Nghimtina and to Lt-Gen Sebastian Ndeitunga, commander of the Namibian police, among others.One source said Boulter had bought a number of male white rhinos for trophy-hunting on his farm \u2014 such hunting of black and white rhino is legally permitted in Namibia under certain conditions. Foreign hunters can be charged up to \u00a3216,000 a head for killing a rhino, depending on the size of the horn.But he had problems. An acquaintance said he became depressed after his divorce and had taken to drinking heavily. Friends of the Van Wyk family said Boulter had attended the younger Van Wyk's wedding to Liani last year, when he got very drunk and abusive towards other guests.At the Kamanjab Oktoberfest (Namibia was once part of the German Empire) last year, he is said to have insisted that everyone drink glasses of J\u00e4germeister, a powerful German digestif, with him. Boulter proceeded to get so drunk, he had to be carried to his car to be taken back to the farm 20 miles away.During the fatal incident last month, Boulter held a gun to the younger Van Wyk's head, several sources have told the Mail.After the shooting, Boulter was taken to Outjo and charged with murder before being transferred to the private MediClinic hospital in Windhoek for an operation on his hand.Last night, Van Wyk family lawyer Jan Wessels said Boulter's whereabouts were a mystery. 'We heard he was in the MediClinic but when we followed that up, we were told he was discharged on March 5. I am waiting to hear back from the prosecutor.'Wessels added that Mr Van Wyk's body had been sent to Windhoek this week for a second autopsy. 'So we know where the deceased is but not where the accused is. I hope he is still in custody but we will have to wait and see.'Outjo state prosecutor Penda Hamunyela said that, as far as he knew, Boulter was still undergoing medical treatment. He was shocked to hear that he had apparently been discharged.Speaking to the Mail, Boulter's lawyer, Evert Gouws, would only confirm the charge of murder against his client. He would not disclose whether Boulter was in police custody.The tycoon is scheduled to appear in a local court on April 24 for a preliminary hearing.Money talks in Namibia, though it will take a lot for Harvey Boulter to walk away from this.But as a friend of Gerhardus Van Wyk told the Mail last night: 'Up there [in Kaross], a man like Boulter is a law unto himself.'Additional reporting: John Grobler in Namibia and Mike Behr in South Africa",

The UN Security Council on Friday approved a resolution allowing for almost 3,000 more peacekeepers to deploy in the Central African Republic, which is still under threat from armed groups trying to overthrow the government. Drawn up by France, the resolution was adopted by 14 out of 15 members of the Security Council, with just Russia, which has troops deployed in the country, abstaining, diplomatic sources said. \"We wanted (the) text to mention the UN guiding principles for humanitarian assistance,\" said Dmitry Polyanskyi, the Russian ambassador to the UN, who added that attempts by unnamed countries to \"dilute the strictness of the parameters of humanitarian assistance is not acceptable.\" \"Russia continues to be guided by the need for close coordination with the governments of the recipient countries in the delivery of humanitarian aid to their territory and distribution,\" he said. MINUSCA, as the UN mission is known, is one of the UN's biggest peacekeeping operations in the world, with an annual budget approaching $1 billion. The resolution sets out an increase of 2,750 more soldiers and 940 more police officers. That will bring the total number of forces deployed in the country to 14,400 soldiers and 3,020 police. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last month that \"the Central African Republic is at a critical juncture that will determine if peace and stability will be restored and put on a firmer footing.\" The Security Council also adopted a resolution extending its peacekeeping mission in South Sudan until March 15, 2022, without changing its strength despite a recent study recommending it be reduced to 15,000 troops from the current 17,000. In February year, President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar, for years on opposing sides of the battlefield, formed a coalition government after nearly a year of delay and haggling along with international pressure. The ceasefire they agreed upon still largely holds, but observers say it is under increasing strain. The US-drafted resolution was approved unanimously, diplomatic sources said.",

NEEDS: Coming off their deepest playoff run since the 1993 season, the Bills focused on using their limited space under the salary cap to retain their own free agents. It began Thursday, when Buffalo re-signed starting linebacker Matt Milano to a four-year contract. Milano's return, however, came at a price after the Bills freed up more than $14.4 million in cap space by releasing receiver John Brown and defensive lineman Quinton Jefferson. The Bills created additional room by restructuring several existing contracts. GM Brandon Beane then turned his focus on keeping his starting offensive line intact by re-signing Daryl Williams and Jon Feliciano. The re-signings currently leave Buffalo with little to spend once the market opens with the team having needs at tight end and cornerback.

        "full article": "US artist Nicholas Galanin's piece \"Never Forget\" is on display during Desert X, in California's Coachella Valley  The giant, white letters standing astride a California mountainscape look a lot like the Hollywood sign, but their message could hardly be more different -- this is \"INDIAN LAND.\" The monumental work is part of Desert X, which Friday became one of the first large-scale art festivals to reopen in the pandemic, welcoming visitors to outdoor installations scattered across 40 miles (65 kilometers) of the Coachella Valley. Indigenous Alaskan artist Nicholas Galanin placed his project \"Never Forget\" at the entrance to Palm Springs -- a playground getaway long favored by movie stars -- as a reminder of Hollywood's role in whitewashing US culture. The 45-foot-high structure is identical in scale and material to the Los Angeles landmark, which originally spelled \"Hollywoodland\" and was a 1923 \"real-estate advertisement for white-only communities,\" he told AFP at Thursday's preview.          Saudi artist Zahrah Al Ghamdi stands by her piece \"What Lies Behind the Walls\" at the Desert X exhibit  \"The iconography of Hollywood, of the sign, the history of indigenous misrepresentation in media and movies plays a large role in the erasure of our communities,\" said Galanin. \"Even the term 'Indian'... was specific to indigenous people in America's colonial experiences of mistitling and of removing our own place names.\" Galanin's work directs visitors to a GoFundMe page aiming to raise $300,000 to restore Native American ownership of a plot of land in the mountains behind the sign, part of a broader \"LandBack\" movement. But even its presence in this patch of desert is remarkable at a time when few art projects are able to open, with museums in southern California still closed due to Covid-19. Desert X co-curator Cesar Garcia-Alvarez said forging ahead was a \"practical decision\" to support artists in \"a year where everything got canceled,\" but admitted it was not easy despite the socially distanced setting. \"Working remotely with artists, not being able to do as many site visits, delays in shipping because there's so many things backed up, ensuring safety... but we did it!\" he said. \"I'm glad we did because at some point we're also going to have to pivot to what it means to experience art in this new world. \"And I hope that this can be a case study in a way for other large-scale exhibitions.\"          Visitors tour US artist Eduardo Sarabia's piece \"Passenger\" at the Desert X exhibit  Founded in 2017, Desert X drew 400,000 visitors to its previous edition in the valley east of Los Angeles, and this time \"health ambassadors\" have been hired to monitor face coverings and social distancing at peak hours. Still, the exhibition was delayed by just over a month due to California's severe winter Covid-19 spike. - 'A trigger' - Aside from Galanin's, several other artworks sounded political notes, including a tall, thin section of wall that spikes incongruously out of the arid landscape, composed by Saudi artist Zahrah Al Ghamdi from 6,000 tiles containing local soils. Visitors are encouraged to walk around the structure entitled \"What Lies Behind the Walls,\" which draws links between her desert homeland and the California valley's rugged landscape and architecture. But the symbolism of a barrier so close to the US-Mexico frontier -- and devised during Donald Trump's presidency -- is clear.          People walk inside Egyptian artist Ghada Amer's \"Women's Qualities\" piece at Desert X  \"I definitely was inspired by what happened... there should never be walls in between people, in between countries,\" said Al Ghamdi. \"I took it as a sign that I have to create a wall that shows our similarities and how we can join as a culture and not separate from each other.\" On the far side of the valley, Eduardo Sarabia's arrow tip-shaped maze is constructed of traditional Mexican woven-palm rugs, used by travelers to rest during long journeys as far back as Aztec times. \"Immigration... and the dialogue about Mexicans in general, with the last administration -- it was definitely a trigger,\" said US-Mexican Sarabia, whose mother made the perilous journey across the frontier. Creating \"The Passenger\" in a pandemic involved checking that the maze's corridors were wide enough for visitors to socially distance, but ultimately the project was cleared to proceed with its original design. \"To have something like this open during these complicated times, I felt really lucky,\" said Sarabia. \"All my other exhibitions have been postponed.\" Desert X 2021 runs through May 16.",

        "title": "'Obamacare' boost easy for some, but others face paperwork",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - Some consumers will find it quick and easy to take advantage of generous health insurance subsidies in the new COVID relief package, but others face extra paperwork and a wait, federal officials said Friday. The $1.9 trillion legislation signed by President Joe Biden on Thursday includes among its dozens of provisions the biggest expansion of health insurance tax credits under the Affordable Care Act in a decade. It cements the place of the Obama-era law among government health insurance programs, after four years of fruitless efforts by former President Donald Trump to overturn it. Biden's \"Obamacare\" expansion reduces costs for new customers, for those already enrolled in the program, for people who experience unemployment this year, and it may also help many whose incomes were too high to previously qualify for subsidies. But it affects people in each of those groups in a different way, according to a summary released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. Here's a quick overview: - Starting April 1, people who sign up at HealthCare.gov under a special enrollment period Biden opened up will automatically get the benefit of the higher subsidies authorized by Congress. The extra taxpayer-provided assistance reduces net costs by an average of $50 per person per month, CMS said. Think of it as a discount. The special sign-up period ends May 15. - More than 9 million already enrolled and receiving subsidies for their private health insurance plans also stand to benefit from the boost in aid. But they will have to go back to HealthCare.gov after Apr. 1 to get their discounts. Or they could wait until tax time next year to claim the richer tax credit owed them under the legislation. A CMS official said the agency is working to see if it can automatically provide current customers with their savings later this year.          President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief package, in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  - People who experience a spell of unemployment this year are entitled to enroll in a standard HealthCare.gov plan at no cost to them. But officials said figuring out how to connect the health insurance program with unemployment assistance databases is going to take time. Nonetheless, CMS is urging unemployed people to enroll for health care now. They would be able to claim their full subsidies later. - People who previously made too much to get financial help under the \"Obamacare\" limits have some math to do. Congress not only increased the amount of aid, but changed the income formula so more people in the solid middle class can qualify. However, they'll have to have a health plan that meets the standards in the Obama health law. That means many may have to switch coverage. \"Changing anything in the health care system takes a lot of time and a lot of effort,\" said industry analyst Chris Sloan of the consulting firm Avalere Health. It's disappointing that existing customers will have to take extra steps to claim their enhanced subsidies, he added. \"The goal is to stabilize coverage today in the middle of a pandemic, not provide a tax benefit in 2022,\" said Sloan, who said he hopes techies at CMS and their health insurance counterparts find a way to automatically provide the savings in coming months. HealthCare.gov serves 36 states, while others run their own health insurance markets. So different timetables are possible for the rollout of the new benefits. Despite all the potential complexities, supporters of the Affordable Care Act say it's notable that the government will start providing consumers the benefits of Biden's expansion only a few weeks after the president signed the bill. \"I think its great that they are going to be able to implement it for people newly coming in as of Apr. 1,\" said Judy Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which advocates on behalf of low-income people.

        "title": "Police officer charged with murder of Sarah Everard",
        "full article": "A Metropolitan Police officer has been charged with the murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard, as the force confirmed he was admitted to hospital for the second time with a head injury. Serving police constable Wayne Couzens, 48, was charged on Friday evening with kidnapping and killing the marketing executive, who went missing while walking home from a friend\u2019s flat in south London on March 3. Police said Couzens was taken to hospital for a second time with a head injury on Friday, a day after being treated for an injury he sustained while alone in his cell on Thursday. A Met Police spokesman said: \u201cThe suspect was taken to a hospital for treatment to a head injury sustained while in custody in a cell on Friday. \u201cHe was being monitored by officers and received immediate first aid. \u201cHe was discharged the same day and returned to custody.\u201d He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on Saturday. In a statement, Rosemary Ainslie, head of special crime at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \u201cFollowing a referral of evidence by the Metropolitan Police related to the death of Sarah Everard, the CPS has authorised the police to charge Wayne Couzens with murder and kidnapping.\u201d The Met Police said Couzens joined the force two years ago in September 2018 when he worked for a response team covering the Bromley area, before moving to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command in February last year. Speaking outside Scotland Yard on Friday evening, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said: \u201cI would like at this stage to pay tribute to Sarah\u2019s family for their fortitude and forbearance through what can only have been the most intensely difficult few days. \u201cOur thoughts remain with them as this matter progresses. \u201cThe investigation continues of course supported by hundreds of officers from across the Met as well as colleagues in Kent Police. \u201cI would also like to thank at this stage all members of the public who have come forward with information or support for the investigation and would use this opportunity to encourage anyone who thinks they might have useful information to give to get in contact with us.\u201d Scotland Yard confirmed on Friday afternoon that human remains found in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, two days earlier had been identified as Ms Everard. Scotland Yard is facing an investigation by the police watchdog into its handling of separate allegations of indecent exposure against Couzens, whose primary role was on uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises, mainly embassies. He was alleged to have twice exposed himself at a south London fast food restaurant three days before Ms Everard went missing. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is to probe whether two officers \u201cresponded appropriately\u201d in their investigation. A forensics team searched an area of land outside the back fence of the Couzens\u2019 house in Deal, Kent, on Friday, while uniformed officers were posted at a derelict garage in Dover, which was run by his family. Couzens was arrested on Tuesday in Kent, with Commissioner Nick Ephgrave commenting at the time that the fact he is a serving police officer \u201cis both shocking and deeply disturbing\u201d. Ms Everard is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton \u2013 a journey which should have taken around 50 minutes. Her death has prompted an outpouring of grief from the public, with many women and girls sharing stories online of experiencing violence by men. It has led to the Home Office reopening a public consultation on how to tackle violence against women and girls, with officials considering a proposal for legislation to protect women against public sexual harassment. In a message of support, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said: \u201cTestimony after testimony from women over recent days have shown us something we have known and ignored for far too long: the profound impact of the sin of male violence, intimidation, harassment, sexism and abuse carried out against women.\u201d Durham University paid tribute to \u201cbeloved graduate\u201d Sarah Everard, who studied geography at St Cuthbert\u2019s Society. In a statement, vice-chancellor Professor Stuart Corbridge said: \u201cSarah was a popular and lively member of our college community and retained a large Durham University friendship group.\u201d Police said a woman in her 30s, who was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of assisting an offender, had been released on bail to return to a police station on a date in mid-April.",

        "full article": "Elizabeth Holmes, 37, who has been charged with fraud in the spectacular rise and fall of the blood-testing company Theranos Inc, is pregnant, prompting prosecutors and her attorneys to seek a delay in her trial until after her July due date, according to a court filing.Lawyers for Holmes, once a rising star of Silicon Valley, informed the government on March 2 of the pregnancy, according to the filing.\u00a0Holmes' lawyers and prosecutors asked the judge to delay the start of jury selection to August 31.'On March 2, 2021, counsel for Defendant advised the government that Defendant is pregnant, with an expected due date in July 2021,' prosecutors and attorneys for Holmes write. 'Both parties agree that, in light of this development, it is not feasible to begin the trial on July 13, 2021.'\u00a0The trial has already been delayed three times due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0The baby's father is believed to be 29-year-old hotel heir fianc\u00e9 William 'Billy' Evans, whom Holmes married in 2019.\u00a0              Former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, whose criminal fraud trial was scheduled to start in July, is asking for a delay because she's pregnant. Holmes is pictured arriving at the White House (left) in 2015 and at the 2015 Time 100 gala (right)         Holmes is seen sitting next to then-vice president Joe Biden during a visit to Theranos manufacturing in Newark, California, in July 2015. Biden toured the facility and took part in a roundtable discussion on preventive health care at the time\u00a0Evans is the heir to the Evans Hotel Group, which was founded by his grandparents William and Anne Evans in San Diego in 1953. Currently, the business has three resort properties on the West Coast.\u00a0Evans graduated from MIT in 2015 with a Bachelor's Degree in Science and Economics, at which point he took a post at LinkedIn.\u00a0In 2017, he became the director of special projects at Luminar Technologies, a company which develops sensors for driverless cars, although it appears he left the company in 2019.\u00a0In her court case, Holmes and former Theranos President Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani have pleaded not guilty to charges they defrauded investors, doctors and patients by falsely claiming Theranos could revolutionize medical lab testing with technology that could enable a wide array of tests with a few drops of blood.Holmes was indicted in 2018 and her federal trial in San Jose, California, was originally scheduled for July 28, 2020 but was postponed by the COVID-19 pandemic.Holmes' legal team was said to be preparing to raise the issue of mental health as part of her defense strategy.\u00a0In an earlier court filing, Holmes' attorneys wrote they intend to introduce evidence 'relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition of the defendant bearing on... the issue of guilt.'\u00a0         Holmes (pictured), a Stanford University dropout, launched her Palo Alto blood-testing start up in 2003. She and Balwani are accused of scamming investors out of more than $700million\u00a0         Holmes, 37, married hotel heir Billy Evans, 29, in 2019Testimony was to be heard from Dr. Mindy Mechanic, a clinical psychology professor at California State University Fullerton, who 'focuses on the psychosocial consequences of violence, trauma and victimization with an emphasis on violence against women and other forms of interpersonal violence,' according to NBC.\u00a0Holmes, who started Theranos at the age of 19, was celebrated in tech circles until it became clear that many of the claims about the company's supposedly revolutionary blood test were bogus.\u00a0Now, she and her ex-boyfriend Balwani are awaiting their day in court after being accused of falsely claiming the company's machines could perform breakthrough blood tests with a single drop of blood, duping investors out of millions and misleading doctors and patients.\u00a0         The company's COO, Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani (seen above in a San Jose courtroom in November 2019), is also charged with fraudShe and Balwani are accused of scamming investors out of more than $700million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Holmes attracted investors and venture capital firms which saw company reach a $9 billion valuation based on its promise to disrupt the laboratory testing business.Prosecutors submitted a filing in January claiming that Theranos executives destroyed data that proved their blood-testing product was inaccurate. Knowingly misleading investors by providing false data is a federal crime.The company knew about its inaccurate testing data that was collected over a period of three years, according to The Register.       The data \u2018was stored on a specially-developed SQL database called the Laboratory Information Systems (LIS),\u2019 according to the court filing.The database \u2018even flagged blood test results that might require immediate medical attention, and communicated this to the patient\u2019s physician'.Before its collapse, Theranos boasted that it had developed a test that would allow patients to receive results in minutes after providing a drop of blood.But federal prosecutors allege that Theranos executives knew their product was only half-reliable, as the failure rate for the tests was 51.3 per cent.\u2018In other words, Theranos\u2019s TT3 blood test results were so inaccurate, it was essentially a coin toss whether the patient was getting the right result,\u2019 prosecutors said, citing the company\u2019s own data.         Theranos' ground-breaking invention, a machine Holmes claimed could perform hundreds of tests on a drop of blood taken from a pin-pricked finger, was exposed as a humiliating shamA grand jury investigating fraud claims against the company subpoenaed the database, only for the company to allegedly destroy it.\u2018On or about August 31, 2018 - three months after a federal grand jury issued a subpoena requesting a working copy of this database - the LIS was destroyed,\u2019 the federal government alleges in its court filing.\u2018The government has never been provided with the complete records contained in the LIS, nor been given the tools, which were available within the database, to search for such critical evidence as all Theranos blood tests with validation errors.The government also alleges that Balwani hired a crony and paid his firm $10million over seven years to run the database.Instead of handing over all of the data with the inaccurate results, Theranos only provided backup of the database, meaning that the evidence given was incomplete and investigators needed to piece it together with other findings.       The backup data that was given to investigators was only accessible through a computer password that Theranos executives couldn\u2019t remember, according to prosecutors.\u2018The government retained a computer forensic expert to assist in retrieving this data, who found that the \u201ckey\u201d file on the hard drive, required to reconfigure the SQL database, is itself encrypted by a distinct password (not the one provided with the transmittal letter to open the hard drive), and cannot be opened,\u2019 according to the court filing.As investigators were demanding to see the database, Theranos decided to shut down the facility that housed the database in Newark, New Jersey.Company executives were warned beforehand by IT contractor Michael Chung that taking apart the hardware and servers would make it \u2018almost impossible to recreate the database.\u2019But the company went ahead and shut down the database anyway, denying both its own executives and the government access.Holmes, a Stanford University dropout, launched her Palo Alto blood-testing start up in 2003 when she was 19 years old.\u00a0A notoriously secretive company, Theranos shared very little about its blood-testing machine with the public or medical community.\u00a0Holmes said she was inspired to start the company in response to her fear of needles.\u00a0But an investigation by The Wall Street Journal in 2015 found that Theranos' technology was inaccurate at best, and that the company was using routine blood-testing equipment for the vast majority of its tests.\u00a0\u00a0Federal authorities also allege Holmes and Balwani, 56, used funds from investors to subsidize an extravagant lifestyle while peddling a fraudulent product.\u00a0Balwani's case is being handled separately and his trial is scheduled to begin January 18, 2022.",

        "full article": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - The San Francisco 49ers have locked up one of their key cornerbacks before the start of free agency by agreeing to a two-year contract with Emmanuel Moseley before he became a restricted free agent. A person familiar with the deal said Friday on condition of anonymity that Moseley will earn up to $10.1 million under the contract. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal hasn\u00b4t been announced. ESPN first reported the contract. Putting together a secondary is a high priority for the 49ers this offseason with cornerbacks Richard Sherman, Jason Verrett, K\u00b4Waun Williams all eligible to become unrestricted free agents next week, along with reserves Ahkello Witherspoon, Jamar Taylor and Dontae Johnson. Safety Jaquiski Tartt is also headed to the open market. The only returning starter before the deal with Moseley was free safety Jimmie Ward. Moseley originally joined the 49ers as an undrafted free agent out of Tennessee in 2018. He began that season on the practice squad before playing in one game before a shoulder injury ended his season. Moseley became a key part of the defense in 2019 that helped San Francisco reach the Super Bowl. He started nine games in the regular season after taking over for Witherspoon and two in the playoffs. He had an interception in the NFC title game win over Green Bay. Moseley started eight of his 12 games last season with one interception, nine passes defensed and 47 tackles. The 49ers also tendered a one-year contract to exclusive rights free agent offensive lineman Daniel Brunskill and released defensive lineman Ronald Blair III. Brunskill started 16 games last season and has experience playing guard, center and tackle. Blair missed the 2020 season recovering from a knee injury. ___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

In another twist, it is alleged the Tories plan to state publicly that the money came from a new 'Downing Street Trust' \u2013 even though the bill was settled months ago by Lord Brownlow.

Advertisement\n \u00a0 SIMON WALTERS: Row that's really got Boris Johnson rattled - who helped him pay to refurbish his Downing Street flat?\u00a0Analysis by Simon Walters for the Daily MailQuestions\u00a0over who helped Boris Johnson pay for the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat are the latest in a series of controversies over how open he is about where his money comes from.He was warned two years ago he would be punished if he continued to flout Commons rules on disclosing his outside interests.Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, said Mr Johnson had failed to 'demonstrate leadership' by omitting to register a 20 per cent share of a property in Somerset.         Questions over who helped Boris Johnson pay for the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat are the latest in a series of controversies over how open he is about where his money comes fromMPs on the Commons standards committee said his 'over-casual attitude' to parliamentary rules was a 'pattern of behaviour'.They warned he would face a 'more serious sanction' \u2013 a thinly veiled threat to suspend him as an MP \u2013 for any further breaches. Only months earlier, Mr Johnson had to apologise in the Commons for the late declaration of nine payments totalling \u00a352,000 of outside earnings.\u00a0Which, in my view, is why the Prime Minister cannot dismiss similar concerns raised by the flat makeover. The central allegation is familiar: his alleged failure to disclose openly and promptly what other sources of income or benefits he has received.According to insiders, Mr Johnson secretly got a Tory donor to help pay for the refurbishment via the Conservative Party, failed to declare it, subsequently set up a 'Downing Street Trust' to hide the money trail \u2013 and tried to cover up the whole affair.The Commons Register of Interests is clear: MPs must declare 'any pecuniary or other material benefit which might influence his or her action'. And do it within four weeks.The code says politicians must not act 'to gain financial or other benefits for themselves, family or friends'.If \u00a360,000 of Tory party money was secretly used to pay for new decor in the Downing Street flat, it is not difficult to see how some could argue it is against the rules.         Privately, Mr Johnson is worried. In one discussion with aides, he referred to the way David Cameron and wife Samantha paid \u00a325,000 from their own money towards the cost of a new No 11 kitchenMr Johnson appears to be pinning his hopes on avoiding a scandal by setting up the trust. The aim is to use it to maintain the state rooms in Downing Street, and \u2013 in the words of one aide \u2013 'hope that no one notices it also pays for Mr Johnson and Miss Symonds' expensive taste in wallpaper'.It is based on the Chequers Trust which maintains the Prime Minister's official country home. That trust is funded by an endowment from Lord Lee who gave it to the nation a century ago.\u00a0Key trustees are appointed by the Prime Minister, it meets behind closed doors and does not say how it spends its money.You can see the attraction of having a similar arrangement for the Prime Minister's official London home. However, unlike the Chequers Trust, the Downing Street Trust will reportedly be bankrolled by Tory donors, making it overtly political. The risk of a conflict of interest would appear obvious.Publicly, Downing Street claims the row over the refurbishment is a storm in a teacup. Privately, Mr Johnson is worried.In one discussion with aides, he referred to the way David Cameron and wife Samantha paid \u00a325,000 from their own money towards the cost of a new No 11 kitchen.'Cameron got screwed in public even though he paid for it himself,' he said.'If it gets out that I want donors to pay, it'll be a disaster.",

A criminal investigation is now under way.\u00a0RAF police investigators will decide whether the airman was forced to go through the grotesque ordeal.The Air Force insisted it did not tolerate bullying or initiation rituals. But military experts fear the video will cause huge damage to the reputation of the RAF and the Armed Forces generally.Defence chiefs are said to be furious because they have worked to stamp out bullying and ensure that initiation ceremonies, once a staple of military life, were no longer tolerated.\u00a0The incident took place recently in the UK at the end of a course in which RAF Regiment personnel were taught to fire mortars.The regiment, whose headquarters are\u00a0at RAF Honington in Suffolk, is responsible for protecting military airfields.         Drunken troops appeared to sexually assault a young airman in a vile initiation rite caught on video, obtained by the Daily Mail (pictured)\u00a0The disturbing video shows the troops spitting mouthfuls of lager at the airman\u2019s backside.His legs are then forced apart as the 4ft barrel of a mortar, which weighs 28lb, is lowered behind him.The weapon\u2019s ball-shaped socket is then used on the airman as his raucous colleagues slap his buttocks.Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the act of \u2018assault by penetration\u2019 carries a custodial sentence of up to 19 years for the worst offences.

A criminal investigation is now under way. RAF police investigators will decide whether the airman was forced to go through the grotesque ordealA RAF spokesman said: \u2018We have been made aware of an offensive video involving Royal Air Force personnel.\u2018The RAF Police Special Investigation Branch is now investigating the incident shown in the video. It would be inappropriate to comment further while investigations are ongoing.\u2019\u00a0In July last year Defence Secretary Ben Wallace launched an anti-bullying 24/7 telephone helpline for service personnel across the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to allow troops to report any abuse or harassment.It is staffed by qualified counsellors who provide emotional support, information and guidance to callers.         The regiment, whose headquarters are at RAF Honington in Suffolk (pictured), is responsible for protecting military airfieldsMr Wallace said at the time: \u2018Our personnel selflessly serve our nation day in and day out and they deserve to be treated equally, with dignity and respect, both on and off duty.\u2018I want everyone to feel proud of this team. There is simply no place for bullying in our Armed Forces and I am determined to stamp this out. Our helpline is an important next step.\u2019But the 75-second video would appear to suggest that drunken initiation ceremonies for junior personnel continue, even though they are rarer than before.In 2019, Royal Marines taking part in a multi-national exercise to prepare for any future conflict with Russia scrawled a Nazi swastika on the chest of a comrade in another such ceremony. Again, the incident was filmed on a mobile phone and the footage was soon shared on social media.       Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the act of \u2018assault by penetration\u2019 carries a custodial sentence of up to 19 years for the worst offences. A key issue in such cases is consent. Pictured: Royal Air Force HoningtonSuch was the level of embarrassment felt by commanders that top brass even considered banning Marines units from taking part in similar exercises.In 2016 an Army private launched a legal action against the Ministry of Defence after he was forced to quit the ranks due to injuries sustained in a violent initiation ceremony.Oliver Scudder claimed he was pressured to run down a corridor lined by fellow soldiers who struck him with punches and kicks.         Pictured: Badge of the RAF regimentHe was left with 90 per cent loss of vision in his right eye and was medically discharged from the Army after tripping and taking a boot to the face.He said that he felt he had been coerced into taking part in the corridor run and was hit and kicked from both sides by lance corporals and corporals.He had joined his unit, the Royal Anglian Regiment, only nine days previously.During the UK\u2019s long military campaign in Afghanistan the RAF Regiment protected Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand province.This role required the regiment\u2019s troops to be proficient in military skills more commonly taught to Army soldiers, including how to load and accurately fire mortars.It is thought the airmen in the video were learning to use the 81mm variant of the mortar weapon system. It is not known at which base the video was filmed.RAF Regiment mortar teams are trained to drop high-explosive bombs on enemy targets.They use different types of ammunition, including infrared illumination and white phosphorus to create dense smoke screens to cover the movement of ground troops.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GENERAL LORD DANNATT: This degrading act that defies comprehensionCommentary by General Lord Dannatt for the Daily MailI was utterly horrified to learn about the most recent incident of sexual misconduct and bullying allegedly carried out by members of one of our Armed Forces.Degrading acts against another person \u2013 another colleague on whose life in combat your own might depend \u2013 have no place in our services.Respect for others is at the heart of the core values of our military, and these values are taught now as part of the recruit induction process \u2013 and certainly, in the case of the Army, refreshed on an annual basis.If that respect is not at the heart of military life then bullying in training, sexual harassment in the barracks and unwarranted acts of violence against civilians on deployed operations become tolerated, even perhaps the norm. This is totally unacceptable.In 2003 in Basra, soldiers from a now defunct regiment administered more than 90 blows to the body of Baha Mousa. He died. A court martial followed, yet the behaviour that could lead to such appalling actions still seems to take place. This is not acceptable in a civilised society in the 21st century.         GENERAL LORD DANNATT (pictured): I was utterly horrified to learn about the most recent incident of sexual misconduct and bullying allegedly carried out by members of one of our Armed ForcesIf this country wants to play a serious role as \u2018Global Britain\u2019, we must ensure that our ambassadors in military uniform behave to the highest standards.\u00a0What they learn in training will define their actions in combat \u2013 under the glare of the world\u2019s media. The legislation currently going through Parliament \u2013 the Overseas Operations Bill \u2013 is all about protecting our military people from vexatious investigations and prosecutions.But behaviour such as that alleged against a group of inebriated RAF personnel undermines its basic premise.As a nation, we need to have confidence that soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines operating in our name abroad behave to the highest standards.And at home, in training, we do not want to read of disgusting actions by a group of comrades allegedly violating one of their own. This is totally unacceptable and a violation of any sense of decency.To project a mortar barrel into the private parts of another human being is sick beyond belief and a degradation that defies comprehension.General The Lord Dannatt GCB CBE MC DL was Chief of the General Staff, 2006-2009.\u00a0 Wicked stunts leave rookies humiliatedBy\u00a0Kumail Jaffer for the Daily Mail\u00a0The military has previously been mired in shocking cases of newer recruits being humiliated.Two rookies were allegedly forced to rape each other in an initiation ceremony at Pirbright Barracks in Surrey, with the footage passed round the unit.At the time it was revealed in 2016, a source told The Sun on Sunday that the footage was \u2018horrific\u2019 and was \u2018worse than anything I have ever known in the Army\u2019.The same year three Royal Marines were sentenced to military detention after an initiation ceremony subjected a colleague to \u201840 minutes of depravity and naked humiliation\u2019.In 2014 Carlo Nicholson was made to drink urine and to vomit during a ceremony in Arbroath. The 22-year-old, who said he was water-boarded, said the incident made him have \u2018suicidal thoughts\u2019.Inquests into the deaths of four recruits at Deepcut Barracks, Surrey, between 1995 and 2002 also revealed allegations of bullying and harassment.In 2019 it was revealed that at least 122 Army instructors had been court-martialled or disciplined in the four years prior for abuse of recruits and other misconduct.",

However, former President Trump shut it down in 2017.CAM had allowed children under 21 years old with parents lawfully living in the United States to apply for a refugee resettlement interview before making the journey to the United States.The move was the latest step taken by Biden as he tries to create a more humane situation along the border with Mexico.",

(AP) - A man who is a person of interest in the death of his ex-wife and three others in New Mexico has been extradited to New Jersey for a separate murder investigation. Sean Lannon was arrested in St. Louis on Wednesday morning after a manhunt stretching from New Jersey to Missouri ended when he was arrested driving a car stolen from the New Jersey victim. A district commander at the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General, Thomas Gilbert, said that Lannon was processed this morning and is now in custody at Salem County Correctional Facility. Lannon, 47, is scheduled to appear Saturday in court via video. It could not be immediately determined whether Lannon has retained legal counsel. Lannon is accused of breaking into 66-year-old Michael Dabkowski\u00b4s home and beating him with a blunt object on Monday, according to an affidavit. Officers performing a well-being check found Dabkowski\u00b4s body, according to the prosecutor\u00b4s office. Lannon is also a person of interest in the death of his wife and three others in New Mexico. Authorities say a vehicle was discovered last week at the Albuquerque International Sunport garage with four bodies later identified as Jennifer Lannon, 39, Matthew Miller, 21, Jesten Mata, 40, and Randal Apostalon, 60. Sean Lannon lived 80 miles (130 kilometers) away in Grants, New Mexico.

        "title": "Governors applaud Biden's vaccine timeline, but need supply",
        "full article": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Governors largely cheered President Joe Biden's declaration that all adults should be eligible for coronavirus vaccinations by May 1, but the goal will require a shift for states that have been methodical in how they roll out the shots. The top health official in California said the nation's most populous state will need to work harder in the coming weeks to ensure the most vulnerable people get vaccines before they have to compete with the general public. Oregon planned to make essential workers and younger adults with disabilities eligible by May 1, not the broader population, and said Friday it wouldn't change that timeline without firmer supply commitments. Alaska, meanwhile, is already allowing all adults to sign up for a shot. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said before Biden spoke Thursday night that wide eligibility could come by next month, while Colorado Gov. Jared Polis announced Friday that it would happen by mid-April. In Virginia, state vaccine coordinator Dr. Danny Avula said the state could hit Biden\u00b4s goal earlier. Governors in Wisconsin, Louisiana, North Carolina, Kansas and Vermont said they're ready to open the floodgates on May 1. But several governors cautioned it must come with a dramatic increase in vaccine supply. \"In order for widespread and comprehensive vaccination to work, the federal government will need to come through with increased doses and infrastructure,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement.          FILE - In this Dec. 2, 2020, file photo, a customer walks past a sign indicating that a COVID-19 vaccine is not yet available at Walgreens in Long Beach, Calif. Governors cheered President Joe Biden's declaration that all Americans should be eligible for vaccinations by May 1, 2021, but it could further complicate things in a handful of states that have been methodical in their vaccine rollouts. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis, File)  Jeffrey Zients, the White House's coronavirus coordinator, told reporters Friday that May 1 is an \"absolute deadline\" and that the nation will have enough supply between the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to give shots to all adults by the end of that month. Now, an average of 2.2 million doses are being administered per day. As long as supply ramps up, the goal seems reasonable, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an epidemiology professor. But she warned it could create challenges around equity and set unrealistic expectations among Americans that they will immediately be vaccinated come May. Some states may not have the infrastructure to quickly ramp up doses for such a broad pool. \"It could be a delay for people to actually get a vaccine because of the operational constraints,\" she said. Supply was a sticking point in Oregon. Health officials say they won\u00b4t change a plan to allow the general public to be vaccinated starting July 1 until they're sure more doses are coming. \"Until we get more clarity, we need to keep our current timelines in place. We can\u00b4t disappoint people who eagerly want a vaccine,\" said Pat Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority. \"Right now, no one in the federal government has given us hard numbers on what we can expect and when.\" California's health secretary, Dr. Mark Ghaly, said the state must focus on ensuring those most at risk of serious illness get shots before broad eligibility. People with disabilities and certain health conditions join the list Monday, and California doesn't plan to add any other groups before May 1. \"If I want to see us do anything over the next six to seven weeks before May 1, (it\u00b4s) to make sure we get into the communities that have been hardest hit,\" he said Friday. The state says it has the capacity to vaccinate 3 million per week but is getting about half that number of doses. By April 30, the state has set a goal of being able to give 4 million doses weekly. Tim Jin, a 46-year-old Orange County resident with cerebral palsy, said he understands Biden\u00b4s desire to get the country back to normal. But opening up vaccinations to all adults in May will crowd out people with disabilities, who are just becoming eligible for the vaccine in California, he said. \"The first thing that I thought about was how much harder it\u00b4s going to be for people with disabilities to get the vaccine because they are pretty much eliminating the priority list for us,\" Jin said. Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network and a member of the state\u00b4s vaccine advisory committee, said Biden\u00b4s plan should not undercut California\u00b4s equity goals as long as the state maintains its commitments, such as sending more doses to underserved areas. California is dedicating at least 40% of its doses to people in roughly 400 low-income ZIP codes. \"Having more vaccine is absolutely what we want and what we need, and if we still don\u00b4t have enough to meet the demand, then we still need to prioritize,\" she said. Elsewhere, governors met Biden's goal with enthusiasm. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said the state \"will absolutely step up\" to hit the goal. About 13% of residents are fully vaccinated, according to state data, among the highest rates in the country. Now, all West Virginia residents 50 and over are eligible for the vaccine. The state\u00b4s coronavirus czar, Dr. Clay Marsh, said officials may be able to expand eligibility to everyone earlier than May. \"But we want to maintain our commitment to discipline and to make sure that we\u00b4re immunizing the people most likely to be hospitalized or to die first,\" he said. ___ Associated Press journalists Janie Har in San Francisco; Cuneyt Dil in Charleston, West Virginia; Sara Cline in Portland, Oregon; Sarah Rankin in Richmond, Virginia; Patty Nieberg in Denver and Rachel La Corte in Olympia, Washington, contributed.

Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are favourites to sign the prolific Borussia Dortmund starIt is understood that initial contact has been made between City and the Haaland camp, although Chelsea also have the resources to pull off one of the biggest transfer deals of the summer.Solskjaer worked with Haaland at Molde and admitted recently he is still in contact with the player but said United need to be realistic about their transfer plans.City, meanwhile, are attempting to rectify problems with an Etihad Stadium surface that Guardiola believes has hampered his side in recent weeks.         Ole Gunnar Solskjaer failed to lure Haaland to Manchester United in January 2020       The pitch was clearly a problem during last week\u2019s 4-1 victory over Wolves and City\u2019s groundstaff reseeded earlier this week.Sportsmail understands the Premier League leaders, whose surface is the joint-oldest in the division with Burnley\u2019s, are planning to dig up and then rebuild the pitch this summer.\u2018They are working to find a solution but the grass isn\u2019t good,\u2019 Guardiola said. \u2018The weather conditions here in England are tough, but there are stadiums where the grass is good. We were in London against Arsenal, we were in Anfield, even in Old Trafford, and the grass was better than ours. We were in Budapest and the grass was incredible.\u2019City were due to undertake an expensive overhaul of the pitch last year and did not book any summer concerts in preparation, but that was ultimately delayed as a result of the pandemic.

When appointed, he asked for the Etihad and training ground pitches to stand 19mm high, in line with those he had experienced at Bayern Munich, before agreeing a compromise of 23mm to allow for rain and cold weather.City have still managed to win 10 of their last 11 matches at home, only losing against rivals Manchester United last week.

        "title": "Tanzanian PM rejects claims COVID-denying leader is unwell",
        "full article": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Tanzania\u00b4s President John Magufuli is well, the country\u00b4s prime minister said Friday, rejecting opposition claims that the COVID-denying president, who's been out of public view for nearly two weeks, is seriously sick with the virus. Kassim Majaliwa said Magufuli is busy with office duties, and called on the public to ignore widespread reports that he is unwell. \"He is fine and doing his responsibilities,\" Majaliwa said, without disclosing the president\u00b4s whereabouts. Magufuli had controversially claimed that Tanzania has defeated COVID-19 through prayer last year and that there were no more cases. The prime minister said Magufuli, who has not been seen in public for 13 days, asked him to convey his greetings to residents in the country\u00b4s southern town of Njombe. \"The president has a lot to do,\" he said, adding that the president had delegated some duties to his aides. Magufuli\u00b4s absence is unusual as he is known for frequent public speeches and appearances on state television several times a week. Opposition politicians also raised questions about the president\u00b4s health after at least one official close to him died recently. Magufuli was last seen in public on Feb. 27 at the swearing-in ceremony of his chief of staff. The event was at the State House government offices in Dar es Salaam, the East African country\u00b4s largest city. Exiled opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who lost the October presidential election to Magufuli, claimed in a series of Tweets since Wednesday that the president had been flown to India in critical condition after first being taken to neighboring Kenya for COVID-19 treatment. Lissu lives in Belgium due to fears for his life after a government crackdown on opposition politicians who were calling for peaceful protests over alleged massive voting irregularities. He had returned to Tanzania in July to campaign in the election. Lissu started his self-imposed exile from exile following a failed assassination attempt in 2017 in which he was shot 16 times. On Thursday, Constitutional Affairs Minister Mwigulu Nchemba issued threats to those speculating on the president's absence. \"A head of state is not a head of a jogging club who should always be around taking selfies,\" Nchemba posted on his social media accounts. \"Those who are breaking the law, think about what the penal code says on cybercrime. The government is monitoring,\" he said. Magufuli announced last June that Tanzania had defeated COVID-19 through three days of prayer. The country, one of Africa\u00b4s most populous with 60 million people, in April stopped providing statistics about the numbers of people with confirmed cases of COVID-19 or deaths from the disease to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The government has fired some officials who questioned Magufuli\u00b4s assertion that nobody was falling ill from COVID-19 in Tanzania. The government tried to encourage trade and foreign tourism, seeking to avoid the economic pain of neighbors who imposed lockdowns and curfews. It did not ban public gatherings or promote wearing masks, and Magufuli promoted herbal remedies for those who fell ill with what he called \"breathing problems.\" However, people leaving Tanzania reported that hospital intensive care units were filled with patients with severe respiratory illnesses. Others said that burials were being held at night to hide the numbers of deaths. Migrants in other countries from Tanzania were found to have COVID-19. In February, Magufuli appeared to acknowledge the existence of the disease after at least one top official in his administration died of it.",

France remain on course for the title and a clean sweep, despite the disruption of having their last match postponed. And England cannot finish top of the pile after defeats by Scotland and Wales, but a win would help to save face and show these opponents they have no intention of accepting a sudden shift in the cross-Channel balance of power.In the England camp, they know the magnitude of the threat they face. This rivalry has been reignited by France\u2019s progress under Fabien Galthie and the home players are relishing that fact, despite the problems it may pose, today and beyond. \u2018We\u2019ve seen their growth since the World Cup,\u2019 noted Mako Vunipola this week.\u2018France are coming here as one of the best, if not the best team in Europe. For them to be back up there challenging and being a force again is not only good for them, it\u2019s good for rugby in general.\u2019What has not been so good for the Six Nations in particular has been the recent Covid chaos in the French camp, which saw Galthie and other staff members, along with 11 players, test positive for the virus.It emerged players left their \u2018bubble\u2019 in Rome to go for waffles, while Galthie went to watch his son play a match in Paris and Federation president Bernard Laporte took a commercial flight, in defiance of protocols.While the Federation and their government presided over a whitewash \u2014 exonerating all involved \u2014 Galthie has been under fire and Laporte has threatened players about the need to maintain unity and in-house secrecy, or face being jettisoned. It has created tension in the ranks in the midst of their bid for a first title since 2010.         England will need their creative veterans like Owen Farrell to use all their experience to win       The postponement of the game against Scotland means France have not played since February 14, though some of the squad made appearances for their clubs last weekend. Eddie Jones played down the likely impact on the visitors, the England head coach saying: \u2018They\u2019ve had the luxury of maybe giving their players a break. They are a well-prepared side and we know they\u2019ll be ready to play.\u2019However, former England back-rower Joe Worsley, now coaching at Castres, has seen how French clubs \u2014 including his own \u2014 have struggled after Covid breaks and he told Sportsmail: \u2018It\u2019s a big problem. The French team is going to be affected in some way. If you look at the teams who had this problem, there have been different performances after. They will be fresher and raring to go but for a week or two after, it\u2019s not great.\u2019England will seek to capitalise on any rustiness, while striving for a delicate balance between essential ferocity and renewed composure. They cannot give away another torrent of penalties like the 14 in Cardiff, which explains why two English referees \u2014 Matthew Carley and Wayne Barnes \u2014 have assisted with their preparations.Keeping their heads will not be easy amid the bid to avoid a third defeat in four games. France are too powerful to be overwhelmed by an English onslaught. They will apply brutal pressure of their own, even if the hosts should be capable of claiming an edge in the set piece, especially as France are deprived by injury of influential lock Bernard Le Roux.         England cannot afford to be too fixated on France's lethal scrum-half Antoine Dupont       Against Wales, there was improved fluency in England\u2019s attack and that progress must continue, as scoring chances may be strictly limited by a pragmatic, territorial side defensively drilled by Shaun Edwards. For all the talk of transition, Jones\u2019s side have a well-established creative hub in the Ben Youngs-George Ford-Owen Farrell axis and those veterans will need to outsmart their younger counterparts.If there is too much fixation with the lethal scrum-half, Antoine Dupont, the danger is Matthieu Jalibert will be free to wreak havoc in the No 10 shirt. He managed to do so often enough in the Autumn Nations Cup final, when Galthie deployed his reserves and nearly caused an upset, but this time the Bordeaux playmaker can unleash so much deadly firepower out wide. Virimi Vakatawa\u2019s return further enhances the potency of the Gallic back line.There is no crowd to galvanise England and France proved their greater resilience away from home by claiming a backs-to-the-wall win over Ireland in Dublin, their last outing. They have not won at Twickenham in the Six Nations since 2005 but then Scotland had not done so for 38 years until last month. Predicting this one certainly is not a scientific process, but a strong hunch is England will rise to the challenge and show they are not yet ready to fall into the shadow of the French.That moment may come, before the next World Cup, but perhaps not on Saturday.

        "title": "Workload worries: MLB teams ponder how to protect pitchers",
        "full article": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) - If the Arizona Diamondbacks want to win a lot of games this season they probably need right-hander Zac Gallen to throw a lot of quality innings. If the franchise wants to be good for the next several years, it's also imperative that the 25-year-old - who finished ninth in the NL Cy Young voting last season - stays healthy. The challenge of balancing the present and the future is nothing new for Major League Baseball teams, who are particularly careful with star young pitchers. But the calculus might be even tougher in 2021 because pitchers are coming off a much smaller workload during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. Gallen, who finished with a 3-2 record and a 2.75 ERA last season in 72 innings, is adamant he's ready to ramp back up to nearly 200 innings if needed, even if it appears unlikely the D-backs would push him that hard. \"I'm going to pitch until they tell me to stop pitching,\" Gallen said. \"And then I'll probably still say, `No, let me go back out there.\u00b4\" There's little doubt teams will be very careful extending their pitchers to the usual 180 to 200 innings that a typical starter logs in a 162-game season. There's even talk about using six-man rotations for some teams, including the Seattle Mariners, who used the strategy for much of 2020 during the 60-game schedule.

If the Arizona Diamondbacks want to win a lot of games this season they probably need right-hander Zac Gallen to throw a lot of quality innings. If the franchise wants to be good for the next several years, it's also imperative that the 25-year-old - who finished ninth in the NL Cy Young voting last season - stays healthy. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File)  \"Our primary thought behind it is to preserve the health and well-being of our pitchers,\" Seattle GM Jerry Dipoto said. \"In an era where teams are trying to find a competitive advantage by throwing their starters for shorter lengths of time and just running them harder, we feel like our advantage, our competitive advantage is by keeping our pitchers healthy and having our best pitchers pitch over the length of the season, rather than the potential dangers of running them into the injury.\" The Detroit Tigers have several young pitchers they're trying to bring along slowly and new manager A.J. Hinch said the six-man rotation is a possibility. \"We\u00b4ve got a lot of guys that we\u00b4re wanting to stretch out and give a look, and obviously there\u00b4s a competition going on for five or six spots, depending on what we go with,\" Hinch said. But the strategy might not be a great decision for every team. The five-man rotation has been a durable staple for MLB teams over the past 30 to 40 years, even as sabermetrics have changed many of the game's strategies. The math is fairly simple. In a five-man rotation, pitchers make about 32 starts per season. Assuming an average of about six innings per start, that's 192 innings through a 162-game schedule. In a six-man rotation, the number of starts goes down to 27. At six innings a start, that's 162 innings in a season, or 30 less than a pitcher in a five-man rotation. Certainly, that means pitchers get more rest. But it also means a staff ace isn't on the mound as much. For teams like the Washington Nationals (Max Scherzer), New York Yankees (Gerrit Cole) or Los Angeles Dodgers (Clayton Kershaw and Trevor Bauer), that doesn't seem ideal. Colorado manager Bud Black is one who plans to stick with a five-man rotation if possible. \"A lot of times it\u00b4s what we can condition our players to do and right now our starting pitchers across baseball are conditioned to throw every fifth day,\" Black said. \"We can go on and on about pitch counts and 200 innings and all the things that go in with that, but we as an industry have created some of these standards -- good or bad.\" Teams won't necessarily have to go to a six-man rotation to preserve their arms. There are other strategies available, including fewer innings per start or skipping an occasional start when the schedule allows. \"I\u00b4m not in the logistics business so for me to try and gameplan would be above my pay grade,\" Gallen said. \"But there\u00b4s things I imagine you could do throughout the year. Maybe take a look at days off or whatever it is, push a start back.\" The goal is to avoid a situation where Gallen is shut down during important games in September or the playoffs. The Washington Nationals took a lot of heat in 2012 when they decided to sit young ace Stephen Strasburg during the playoffs. He was coming off an injury the year before and capped at about 160 innings. The Nationals - who won 98 games that year - ended up losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Division Series. In baseball careers with finite chances at postseason glory, it was undeniably a lost opportunity. \"That would be the last time you would want to be sitting on the sideline,\" Gallen said. The flip side? Seven years later in 2019 the Nationals won it all and a healthy Strasburg was named the World Series MVP. ___ AP Sports Writers Pat Graham and Tim Booth and AP Baseball Writer Noah Trister contributed to this story. ___ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          Colorado Rockies manager Bud Black stands in a batting cage during the team's spring training baseball workout in Scottsdale, Ariz., Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021.

        "full article": "The United States makes up about a third of the 340 million doses of Covid vaccines administered worldwide as of March 12, 2021 -- despite comprising just four percent of the world population  Health workers in the United States have administered more than 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, an official tracker showed Friday, around 30 percent of the world's total of shots in arms so far. A total of 101,128,005 shots have been administered, according to the latest tally posted Friday afternoon by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. President Joe Biden's administration had initially targeted achieving this milestone by his hundredth day in office, that is, April 30. But the goal was quickly revised up to 150 million shots in the first 100 days, and this week Biden said there will be enough vaccine to cover the whole adult population of 258 million by the end of May. In terms of the breakdown, 65.9 million people have received at least one dose while 35 million are now fully vaccinated, or 10.5 percent of the total population of 331 million. Sixty-one percent of those over 65 years old, the group most susceptible to severe Covid-19, have received at least one dose. Some fifty million doses of the Pfizer shot have been administered, 49 million of Moderna's, 900,000 of Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine, and a further 100,000 that haven't been identified. More than 340 million doses of Covid vaccines have been administered worldwide, according to an AFP tally. The US therefore accounts for almost 30 percent of those despite making up just over four percent of the world population. Also Friday, the administration announced that new personnel such as dentists, veterinarians and health care students will be recruited to the inoculation campaign nationwide. \"The Department of Health and Human Services will launch a new portal to help individuals determine where they can sign up to volunteer to administer shots,\" Marcella Nunez-Smith, who leads the administration's health equity task force, told reporters. The administration previously authorized any physician or most classes of nurse, either active or retired in the past five years, to administer the shots. The United States is currently administering around 2.2 million shots per day. The state of Michigan said Friday it wanted to drop eligibility requirements for vaccines by April 5, effectively ushering in \"open season\" for all adults. Alaska became the first state to eliminate priority groups on Tuesday. In addition to the three vaccines already authorized, AstraZeneca and Novavax are also carrying out late stage US clinical trials for their vaccines. These could also be authorized if they perform comparably to those already being distributed, and are still required.",

        "full article": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - No. 7 Maryland showed just how deep it is. Alaysia Styles, who was averaging four points per game, scored 15 off the bench to lead a balanced attack and Maryland routed Northwestern 85-52 in the semifinals of the Big Ten women\u00b4s basketball tournament on Friday. \"We had a ton of fun,\" Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. \"You got to have depth to play three games in three days. We showed that with six players in double figures. This team is so unselfish. They make the right play for each other. Every player could put up a lot of points every night, but we are focused on winning.\" The top-seeded Terrapins (23-2) will face sixth-seeded Iowa - an 87-72 winner over seventh-seeded Michigan State in the second semifinal - in the championship game Saturday. The Maryland bench held a 36-14 edge over Northwestern. Styles, a transfer from California, hit all seven of her shots.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings)  \"Angel Reese was telling me, 'I\u00b4ll get out of your way so you can drive,\u00b4 \" Styles said. \"If they believe in me, then I believe in myself.\" Also cracking double figures for Maryland were Chloe Miller with 13 points, Ashley Owusu 12, and Faith Masonius 11. Mimi Collins and Angel Reese each had 10 points for the Terrapins and Reese had a team-high 11 rebounds. Maryland shot 59% from the field and held fifth-seeded Northwestern (15-8) to 30%. Veronica Burton had 14 points and six assists for the Wildcats and Jordan Hamilton added 10 points. Burton, a junior, topped the 1,000-point mark during the game, Maryland used a 22-2 run, including 18 unanswered points, in the last 6:33 of the second quarter to take a 49-24 halftime advantage. The Terrapins made 9 of 11 shots in the second quarter while the Wildcats were 3 of 13 from the field. \"We thought Northwestern would come in very inspired after beating Michigan and I think we matched that intensity,\" Frese said. \"I felt we punched first and never looked back.\" The game-changing spurt came with leading scorer Owusu on the bench for the entire period. Owusu returned to score seven points in the third quarter as Maryland expanded its lead to 70-38 after three quarters. The Terrapins also beat Northwestern 62-50 on the road on Feb. 28. \"We felt we owed it to them because we weren\u00b4t respected enough the first time,\" Reese said. \"Our defense led to offense.\" Northwestern coach Joe McKeown said his team just ran into a buzz saw. \"We played hard against Illinois and Michigan, but the Michigan game was a physical game and I just felt we ran out of gas today,\" he said. RECORD APPEARANCE Maryland is making its seventh consecutive appearance in the Big Ten Tournament championship game, the most consecutive by either men or women. Maryland, which has been in the final every year since joining the conference. is seeking its fifth title in those seven years. \"It starts with our focus,\" Frese said. \"It is an incredible accomplishment.\" FIRST DOUBLE-DOUBLE Reese, a freshman forward for Maryland, notched her first career double-double. \"I was just having fun with my teammates,\" she said. \"I had fresh legs off the bench. I do what the team needs me to do, and today it was rebounding.\" BIG PICTURE Northwestern: After getting a boost for a better NCAA Tournament slot by beating No. 13 Michigan in Thursday\u00b4s quarterfinals, the Wildcats likely squandered that with the blowout loss. Maryland: The Terps strengthened their bid for a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

        "full article": "By Daphne Psaledakis WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The State Department on Friday said Washington has decided not to lift the pause in assistance to Ethiopia for most programs in the security sector, days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described acts in Tigray as ethnic cleansing. State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Friday that while the United States has decided to resume certain types of assistance, including that related to global health and food security, assistance for other programs and most programs in the security sector would remain paused. \"Given the current environment in Ethiopia, we have decided not to lift the assistance pause for other programs, including most programs in the security sector,\" Price said at a news briefing. Blinken has pressed Ethiopia to end hostilities in Tigray and on Wednesday, testifying before Congress, he said he wanted to see forces in Tigray from Eritrea and Amhara be replaced by security forces \"that will not abuse the human rights of the people of Tigray or commit acts of ethnic cleansing, which we've seen in western Tigray.\" Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes, and there are shortages of food, water and medicine in the region of more than 5 million people. The State Department last month said Washington will de-link its pause on some aid to Ethiopia from its policy on the giant Blue Nile hydropower dam that sparked a long-running dispute between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. But it cautioned that resumption of assistance would be assessed on a number of factors, including \"whether each paused program remains appropriate and timely in light of developments in Ethiopia that occurred subsequent to the pause being put in place,\" according to a State Department spokesperson. Ethiopia\u00b4s military ousted the former local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), from the regional capital Mekelle in November, after what it described as a surprise assault on its forces in Tigray. The government has said that most fighting has stopped in Tigray but has acknowledged isolated incidents of shooting. Both sides deny their forces have committed atrocities, and blame other forces for the killing of civilians. (Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Daniel Wallis)",

        "full article": "Fresh off their deepest trip into the playoffs in more than a quarter century, the New York Islanders are almost halfway to their first division title in 33 years -- a feat that would surely engender thoughts of the franchise's first run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 37 years. Now the Islanders must move closer to those long-awaited goals without captain Anders Lee. The Islanders will take the ice without Lee for the first time in four years Saturday night, when they are scheduled to visit the New Jersey Devils in the middle game of a three-game series between the longtime division rivals in Newark, N.J. The series began Thursday, when the Islanders never trailed in a 5-3 win in Uniondale, N.Y. But New York's seventh straight win was overshadowed by the first-period sight of the 6-foot-3, 235-pound Lee requiring assistance to exit the ice following collision with the Devils' Pavel Zacha. The Islanders announced Friday that Lee will be out indefinitely with a lower body injury. The team said no further information will be provided. The injury will end Lee's consecutive games played streak at a team-high 295 -- the longest active streak for an Islanders player -- and leave him on the sidelines for the first time since he missed a 4-2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Jan. 24, 2017. It will also leave the Islanders, who lead the Washington Capitals by two points in the East Division, without their leading goal-scorer -- Lee has 12 goals this season, one more than Brock Nelson -- and on- an off-ice leader. New York advanced beyond the first round in each of Lee's first two seasons as captain, something the franchise hadn't done since 1984-85, and made the conference finals last summer for the first time since 1993. \"Anders is our captain -- he's our leader, he does everything right, he's such a good pro and such a good person,\" Islanders head coach Barry Trotz said Thursday night. \"Very few times Anders Lee (is) struggling to get up from any kind of hit or anything. He's a tough, tough man and everybody on our bench felt for him there.\" The Devils' 10th loss in 12 games featured another too-little, too-late third-period comeback. New Jersey fell behind 4-0 and was outshot 20-12 over the first two periods Thursday before scoring three times in the final 20 minutes. \"I think the team as a whole, we stood around a little too much in the first 40 minutes,\" Devils right winger Kyle Palmieri said. It was the second straight three-goal third period for the Devils, who overcame a three-goal deficit to force overtime against the Capitals in a 5-4 loss on Tuesday night. In addition, Thursday marked the third time in six games this month the Devils haven't scored in the first two periods. New Jersey hasn't led an opponent through two periods since Feb. 21, when it squandered a one-goal lead in a 4-3 loss to the Capitals. \"If we're going to get behind the eight-ball every game, it's going to make it really, really hard on this group,\" Devils head coach Lindy Ruff said Thursday night. --Field Level Media",

        "title": "Ty Gibbs heads to desert seeking another surprise NASCAR win",
        "full article": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Ty Gibbs understands why some struggle to grasp how an 18-year-old without a single minute of experience at NASCAR's national level just won his very first race. He'd never driven an Xfinity Series car before, never participated in a live pit stop, and then without any practice or qualifying, Gibbs beat reigning series champion Austin Cindric on the road course at Daytona International Speedway. But, how? \"You know what Pop Warner football is, right?\" said the grandson of three-time Super Bowl winning coach Joe Gibbs. \"It's like taking a quarterback from the Pop Warner Football League and putting him in a college football game, a big bowl game, and you're not allowed to stretch. You're going in there cold, you might pull a muscle, but you're firing off into the game.\" OK, so that's what it felt like to Gibbs. But a Pop Warner quarterback is unlikely to lead a college football team to a bowl game victory, much the same way a rookie isn't supposed to beat 39 other drivers who all had far more experience than Gibbs. Gibbs had never even heard the engine in his Toyota until he turned it on moments before last month's race. He'd never used a switch panel like the one inside the Xfinity car, was unfamiliar with the dashboard and even the placement of the window was a new thing.          Ty Gibbs celebrates in Victory Lane after winning the NASCAR Xfinity Series road course auto race at Daytona International Speedway, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Daytona Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)  Gibbs credits the successful debut to visualization techniques he's relied on in his short racing career. He'd only run two full seasons at lower levels of competition before this year but won seven of his 23 outings. \"What I really enjoy is when I can see it in my brain, when I can envision what I am doing, I know I can put myself in there and do it,\" Gibbs said. \"I feel like that's one of the skills that I've been blessed with and one of the tools that's helped me. Like a golf swing, if I feel like I can do it with my eyes closed, I feel like I can just out the same thing to a race car.\" Although his grandfather gives him top equipment from Joe Gibbs Racing to drive, Gibbs' career is largely steered by his father. It was Coy Gibbs who bumped his son up two levels of competition - Ty Gibbs skipped the Truck Series completely and went straight to Xfinity - and mapped out his 2021 season. Ty Gibbs will run a full ARCA schedule again this year and pursue a championship but now that he's the legal age to compete at NASCAR's national level, he will also dabble in the Xfinity Series to gain experience for a potential full-time 2022 move. Three days after his Daytona victory, JGR announced 14 additional Xfinity races for Ty Gibbs this year beginning Saturday at Phoenix Raceway. It will be double duty for Gibbs, who will run Friday night in the ARCA Series race. Cindric, who had a gaping hole in his car from an early accident at Daytona, pushed Gibbs hard around the road course to force the rookie into a mistake. Because of the damage on Cindric's car, he knew he'd lose his shot at winning the race if Gibbs got to the lead. \"I put him in some really tough spots trying to hang onto the lead... so he handled everything really well and was in a position on those restarts and made some decisions and won the race because of it,\" Cindric said. \"I feel like he\u00b4s showcased that he has the pace and he has the talent and it\u00b4s for everyone else to observe and for him to decide how the next couple races are going to go.\" The Toyota from his grandfather's team will be among the best in the field at Phoenix - \"he\u00b4ll obviously have capable equipment,\" Cindric noted - but Gibbs isn't concerned about pressure for a repeat performance. \"There's no reason to stress myself out. I don't have any expectations ever set for myself,\" Gibbs said. \"I feel like the same attitude and mental mindset going into every race and that's to get the best finish I can and the most experience for myself so I can be the best racecar driver I can possibly be in the future.\" ___ More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          Ty Gibbs celebrates in Victory Lane after winning the NASCAR Xfinity Series road course auto race at Daytona International Speedway, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Daytona Beach, Fla.

        "full article": "\"Everydays: the First 5,000 Days,\" a digital artwork by US artist Beeple has sold for more than $69 million  The buyer of a landmark work by the digital artist Beeple, which sold for $69.3 million, is a leading collector of new technologies who operates under the pseudonym Metakovan, the auction house Christie's announced Friday. The sale of \"Everydays: the First 5,000 Days\", a virtual mosaic created by Mike Winkelmann -- the US artist's real name -- caused upheaval on the art market, where digital art was still a niche just six months ago. Only two artists have achieved a higher price during their lifetimes in the history of the arts, the British painter David Hockney and the US visual artist Jeff Koons. The purchaser of the digital collage, Metakovan, is one of the oldest investors in \"NFT,\" or \"Non-Fungible Tokens,\" which are virtual objects like \"Everydays,\" whose authenticity and traceability are deemed to be inviolable. \"NFTs\" are based on so-called \"blockchain\" technology, which is also used by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. In 2017, together with his partner, who goes by the pseudonym Twobadour and whose identity is also a closely guarded secret, Metakovan created Metapurse, the main investment fund in \"NFT\" virtual objects, of which he is the main financier. At the beginning of January, Metapurse announced it had acquired 20 virtual paintings from Beeple for a total of approximately $2.2 million. \"When you think of high-valued NFTs, this one is going to be pretty hard to beat,\" said Metakovan, in a statement released by Christie's. \"And here's why -- it represents 13 years of everyday work.\" The 39-year-old artist from Charleston, South Carolina, started the \"Everydays\" project back in 2007, with the mission of producing a work every day. After 5,000 consecutive days, \"Everydays\" brought together his daily pieces in digital form, beginning with a simple image of his Uncle Jim and ending on a detailed graphic portrait of characters from Donald Trump to Buzz Lightyear to Michael Jackson, depicted as dystopian muses around a child drawing. To date, Winkelmann has produced 5,064 consecutive images -- individually visible on his Instagram feed. Techniques are replicable and skill is surpassable, but the only thing you can't hack digitally is time,\" said Metakovan. \"This is the crown jewel, the most valuable piece of art for this generation. It is worth $1 billion.\" In mid-January, Metapurse announced the launch of three virtual museums in which it will exhibit acquisitions from the fund, enhanced by the use of virtual reality.",

        "title": "NC's top court orders new trial in Irish businessman's death",
        "full article": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - North Carolina's highest court ruled Friday that a woman must get a new trial in her husband's 2015 beating death and granted the same to her father, agreeing evidence had been wrongly excluded that weakened their ability to argue they acted in self-defense. A 4-3 majority on the state Supreme Court sided with a lower appeals court decision that reversed a jury's second-degree murder convictions of Molly Corbett and Thomas Martens, a retired FBI agent, in the death of Irish businessman Jason Corbett. Each was sentenced from 20 to 25 years in prison for the death of the 39-year-old man at the Corbetts' home in a golf course community in Davidson County. Investigators said they used an aluminum baseball bat and brick paver to kill Jason Corbett, fracturing his skull and causing injuries to his arm, legs and torso. The father and daughter said they used deadly force because they feared for their lives. Martens, who lived in Tennessee, testified at their 2017 trial that he had awakened at night at the Corbetts' home by noises and a scream. He said he found the couple in their bedroom, and Jason Corbett with his hands around Molly Corbett's neck saying \"I'm going to kill her,\" according to the ruling. Molly Corbett didn't testify. In the majority opinion, Associate Justice Anita Earls wrote that Superior Court Judge David Lee erred chiefly by excluding evidence from trial that would have been central to the pair\u00b4s defense. That's in keeping with the majority on a state Court of Appeals panel in 2020. Earls pointed to omitted statements that the Corbetts\u00b4 two children had made during a medical evaluation soon after the death that indicated their father had been abusive in the home. Lee ruled the statements weren\u00b4t trustworthy, pointing out the children had recanted some previous accusations in a later interview with prosecutors and in diary entries. But the reversal \"in no way calls into question all of the statements the children made,\" Earls wrote. The children\u00b4s statements suggested Jason Corbett had been increasingly angry and gotten mad the night of his death when his 7-year-old daughter couldn't fall asleep, according to the ruling. Without the evidence, \"it was easier for the jury to conclude that Tom and Molly had invented their story in an effort to cover up their crime and falsely assert that they acted in self-defense,\" Earls wrote. Judge Phil Berger Jr. wrote the dissenting opinion, saying the convictions should have been restored. He said Lee didn't abuse his discretion when ruling on the issues identified, including the children's statements. \"The evidence against (the) defendants in this case was overwhelming,\" Berger wrote. \"Each defendant had the opportunity to argue and present their arguments of self-defense to the jury.\" The 4-3 decision fell upon party lines, with the court's registered Democrats agreeing to the new trial. The court's majority also left intact a portion of the Court of Appeals ruling that determined Lee had erred by admitting some expert testimony about blood spatter in the bedroom. Jason Corbett met Molly Corbett when she worked in Ireland as an au pair for the children from his first marriage, according to filings. His first wife had died earlier from asthma-related complications. The four moved to Davidson County in 2011 and Jason and Molly married that year.",

Herat Governor Sayed Abdul Wahid Qatali said several women and children were among the dead. He added that at least 53 people including civilians and security forces have been hurt in the explosion. Dozens of homes and shops were also damaged in the blast as rescuers rushed to the scene to help several people trapped under the rubble, Qatali said. No one claimed responsibility for the bombing but local officials blamed the Taliban insurgents. Representatives of the Taliban, which has been fighting a foreign-backed Afghan government since they were ousted from power by U.S.-led forces in late 2001, were not immediately available to comment. Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban in Qatar\u00b4s capital Doha have struggled to make progress amid international calls to reduce violence. Russia plans to hold a conference on Afghanistan in Moscow on March 18 and has invited several regional players, including Afghan government and politicians to jumpstart the peace process as diplomacy by foreign powers including Washington ramps up. It comes at a crunch time for the peace process as a May 1 deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan looms and the United States reviews its plans.

Replacing Walt Odisho, who is retiring after being plucked from the auto industry to help Boeing boost productivity, Clark steps into the role as the U.S. planemaker works to clear an inventory of hundreds of 737 MAX aircraft and rebuild its image with passengers after the nearly two-year MAX grounding following fatal crashes. This week marked the second anniversary of the second accident, in Ethiopia, with a final investigative report expected any day. Clark, who was chief mechanic and engineer for Boeing's cash cow narrowbody program, will run the sprawling manufacturing hub at Renton, Washington. Clark is the fifth person in four years to take the helm of the program, which has over the years grappled with quality shortfalls, parts shortages and then the safety ban following the crashes. Mark Jenks, vice president in charge of airplane programs, announced the change in a Friday memo to employees. The move was reported earlier by Bloomberg. (Reporting by Eric M.

        "full article": "By Simon Lewis WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The Biden administration will grant temporary deportation relief and work permits to Myanmar citizens living in the United States because of the military's crackdown https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics/britain-urges-citizens-to-leave-myanmar-as-violence-against-protesters-mounts-idUSKBN2B409L following the Feb. 1 coup, senior administration officials said on Friday. The decision means about 1,600 Burmese already in the United States, including diplomats who have broken with Myanmar's junta, will be eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, two officials told Reuters. The program grants immigrants who cannot return to their countries safely, for reasons such as natural disasters or armed conflict, the ability to stay and work in the United States legally for a defined period that can be renewed. The officials said the situation in Myanmar after the military seized power prevents Burmese from returning, citing the violent crackdown by security forces, arbitrary detentions and worsening humanitarian conditions. Thomas Andrews, the United Nations human rights investigator https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2L96D9 on Myanmar said on Thursday the junta had killed at least 70 people and detained more than 2,000. Some Myanmar diplomats posted to the United States have spoken out publicly against the military, including Permanent Representative to the United Nations Kyaw Moe Tun. Diplomats who \"bravely joined the civil disobedience movement in solidarity with their countrymen back home\" would be able to stay in the United States under the program, one official said. \"We want them to know they can do that safely,\" the official said. The U.S. officials said unless the military reversed course, more punitive action was likely. \"If they do not restore democracy and cease violence against civilians, then we will continue taking actions ... against military leaders and their financial networks,\" one official said. President Joe Biden last month rolled out sanctions on Myanmar on those responsible for the ouster of the southeast Asian nation's civilian-led government, including the defense minister and three companies in the jade and gems sector. Earlier this week, Washington imposed sanctions on two children of military leader Min Aung Hlaing, who had already been designated, and six companies they control. But it has so far held back from sanctions against military conglomerates Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL), among those used by the military to control vast swathes of the economy. \"We are looking at military owned enterprises,\" the official said. \"The gravity of the crisis on the ground means that one set of tools is not going to be sufficient.\" (Reporting by Simon Lewis, Ted Hesson and Humeyra Pamuk; editing by Grant McCool)",

        "full article": "By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The blue-chip Dow powered to its fifth consecutive record high on Friday as investors bought shares that should benefit from a strong reopening of the U.S. economy, an outlook signaled by rising yields in the bond market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled after rebounding more than 6% over the past three sessions and the S&amp;P 500 closed flat after hitting an all-time high the prior session as rising Treasury yields revived inflation concerns. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 posted their best week in five after President Joe Biden signed into law on Thursday one of the largest U.S. fiscal stimulus bills and data reinforced convictions the economy was headed to a high-growth recovery. The recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields has raised fears of a sudden tapering of monetary stimulus and put downward pressure on Wall Street in recent weeks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit 1.642% on Friday, the highest level since February of last year. The rising Dow and tumbling Nasdaq reflect an ongoing sell-off in tech as investors buy cyclical and underpriced value stocks that are expected to do well as the economy recovers. For tech stocks to continue to flourish you need low rates, and in effect slower growth, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC. But with the stimulus package the economy is likely to expand 7% to 9% this year and pressure interest rates, he said. \"That's why you're seeing rates rise today because the reopening is happening faster and stronger than anticipated. And that's when value and cyclicals and economically sensitive stocks outperform,\" Hayes said. The speedy distribution of vaccines and more fiscal aid have spurred concerns of rising inflation despite assurances from the Federal Reserve to maintain an accommodative policy. All eyes will be on the central bank's policy meeting next week for further cues on inflation. U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year, a survey by the University of Michigan showed on Friday. Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 291.74 points, or 0.9%, to 32,777.33, the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.98 points, or 0.10%, to 3,943.32 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 78.81 points, or 0.59%, to 13,319.87. The Nasdaq has been particularly hit by the sell-off in recent weeks and confirmed a correction at the start of the week as investors swapped richly valued technology stocks with those of energy, mining and industrial companies that are poised to benefit more from an economic rebound. Value stocks rose while growth stocks slumped in a continuation of a rotation that began late last year. The high-flying but yield-sensitive group of stocks including of Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and Microsoft Corp, which fueled the past's year rally, fell. Tech, communication services and consumer discretionary indexes, which house these mega-cap stocks, slipped the most among major S&amp;P sectors. The bank index jumped, while financials and industrials clinched new record levels. Ulta Beauty Inc fell after the cosmetics retailer forecast annual revenue below estimates, as demand for make-up products were under pressure due to extended work-from-home policies. U.S.-listed shares of China-based JD.com Inc slid after three sources said it is in talks to buy part or all of a stake in brokerage Sinolink Securities worth at least $1.5 billion.

        "full article": "When the RAAF got its wings a century ago, it had more aircraft than pilots. There were just 149 personnel, including pilots and mechanics, but 170 aircraft. Due to celebrate 100 years on March 31, the RAAF is considered to be among the world's most capable. Aviation author Andrew McLaughlin, editor of Australian Defence Business Review magazine, said the RAAF has realised significant technological advancement. \"In the past two decades it has replaced every platform - except the F/A-18A/B classic Hornet, the last of which will be retired at the end of 2021 - with advanced and, in some cases, world-leading capabilities,\" he told AAP. The RAAF has also introduced technology such as the E-7A Wedgetail airborne command and control platform, the EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft, and soon, the MQ-4C Triton uncrewed maritime surveillance aircraft, McLaughlin said. \"Arguably more importantly, the RAAF has introduced new skills in electronic warfare, command and control, systems integration, and research and development that will ensure the RAAF and wider ADF can operate effectively alone or as part of a larger coalition to protect Australia's interests,\" he said. Until the RAAF's foundation, in March 1921, Australia's fighting aircraft had formed part of the Army, founded along with the Navy on March 1, 1901, shortly after federation. Both services celebrate 120 years this year. Australian air power emerged from the Imperial Conference in London in 1911 which determined that nations of the British empire needed to develop an aviation branch. This was still the dawn of aviation - the Wright brothers had achieved the world's first powered flight barely seven years earlier. Australia chose a site at Point Cook, west of Melbourne for the flying training school in 1914 and Point Cook remains the spiritual home of the RAAF. During WWI, Australian airmen served with distinction in the Middle East and Western Front but with the end of the war, military aviation virtually ceased until 1920 when the Australian Flying Corps was formed. The interwar years were not kind to the new RAAF - there was little money for defence - though aviators, many who had gained their skills during the war, achieved great things. In 1920, three of them founded Qantas. In 1928 Charles Kingsford Smith made the first trans-Pacific flight. By the start of WWII, the RAAF was small - just 246 aircraft - but grew rapidly. Initially, Australian aircraft and aircrew served in Europe and continued to do so until 1945. When Japan entered the war, the RAAF was mauled in initial encounters but then grew in skill and numbers. With supplies of aircraft from traditional sources not assured, Australia stood up local design and manufacturing. Since WWII, the RAAF has served in conflicts in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and the Middle East as well as supporting numerous peacekeeping and disaster relief missions in Australia and around the world. FACTBOX * Australian aircraft first flew operationally over Iraq, then called Mesopotamia, in 1915. RAAF aircraft last flew combat missions over Iraq and also Syria in the campaign against Islamic State. * The first Victoria Cross to an Australian airman went to Lieutenant Frank McNamara who in 1917 in Palestine landed his aircraft to rescue a fellow pilot from charging Turkish cavalry. Only three other Australian airmen have been awarded the VC. * At the end of WWII, the RAAF was the fourth-largest air force in the world, with more than 150,000 personnel operating almost 6000 aircraft. Only the air forces of the US, UK and Russia were bigger. * In 1975, a RAAF Caribou transport aircraft delivering Red Cross supplies during East Timor's civil war was hijacked at gunpoint by Timorese soldiers who demanded to be flown to Darwin. It was going there anyway. No one was hurt but the 54 on board was near double normal capacity.",

        "full article": "For almost a week their voices \u2014 angry, entitled, vengeful and bitter \u2014 have echoed over the airwaves. And in their wake has come the sound and fury of recrimination.Across the globe, the Harry and Meghan interview has divided families, communities and even nations. Its fallout has been greater than anyone could have imagined. We have been bisected by race, by gender and by age.The viewing figures alone are staggering: a television audience of 50 million so far \u2014 a number that is still growing.At its heart, conducting it all, was Oprah Winfrey, whose own worldwide profile comes close to rivalling, possibly even eclipsing, that of Prince Harry and his wife.\u00a0A self-made billionaire, she is the most successful \u2014 and richest \u2014 media star on the planet.         Across the globe, the Harry and Meghan interview has divided families, communities and even nationsHugely respected, compassionate and possessing a credibility unmatched by any other broadcaster, she is America's royalty.But with that authority and that status come obligations. When the claims come as thick and fast as they did from Harry and Meghan, it is hard to keep up. But due to their gravity, every single one must be challenged.Regrettably, that did not happen last Sunday night. Claims went untested, troubling allegations based on second-hand conversations were undisputed, and interpretations left unopposed and therefore accepted as the truth.Gripping television it may have been, as Harry set about his family with an at times cold and ruthless detachment, but viewers were entitled to ask \u2014 and to expect \u2014 that these assertions would be questioned.   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's popularity falls to lowest...    Piers Morgan reveals he quit GMB after REFUSING to apologise...    Prince Philip, 99, begins his fourth weekend in hospital...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n In the space of almost 90 minutes the reputations of the monarchy and of individual Royal Family members were dismantled.Yet even the most egregious of the couple's inflammatory remarks, such as those about racism, were allowed to escape serious scrutiny.It is hard to imagine a Dimbleby, a Paxman or a Humphrys allowing so many damaging statements to pass without drilling down to find context and perspective.By any stretch of the imagination, the Harry and Meghan claims demanded to be properly and thoroughly investigated.Here, the Mail lays bare the contradictions and inaccuracies at the heart of their interview, untangling fact from fiction.And today we appeal to U.S. broadcaster CBS and Oprah Winfrey herself: based on our report, can we now look forward to a follow-up \u2014 Harry & Meghan . . . The Other Side Of The Story?\u00a0 Tears over flower girls         During the interview Meghan claimed it was she who was reduced to tears prior to her wedding. Pictured: Princess Charlotte was one of Meghan's six bridesmaidsSix months after the 2018 royal wedding, reports began to emerge that Meghan had made Kate cry following a fitting for the bridesmaids' dresses (Princess Charlotte was one of Meghan's six bridesmaids).But Meghan claims that, in reality, 'the reverse happened', telling Oprah that she was the one who had been reduced to tears, not Kate. In her interview, she claimed Kate had subsequently said sorry for the incident, too.'It was a really hard week of the wedding. And she was upset about something, but she owned it, and she apologised.\u00a0And she brought me flowers and a note, apologising. And she did what I would do if I knew that I hurt someone, right, to just take accountability for it.'Intriguingly, The Times this week shed further light on the episode, reporting that the day after the incident, the Duchess of Cambridge had indeed taken a bunch flowers to Nottingham Cottage, Harry and Meghan's home at Kensington Palace at the time, as a peace offering.         In her interview, she claimed Kate had subsequently said sorry for the incident, tooAccording to the newspaper, Meghan then slammed the door in her future sister-in-law's face.\u00a0If that's true, one can safely assume that both she and Kate were hugely upset. It's therefore perfectly possible that both cried.However, a third scenario is presented by perhaps the most compelling source of all: Meghan's pet journalist, Omid Scobie.\u00a0In his biography Finding Freedom, published with Meghan's apparent approval, he confidently declared that no one had cried, saying: 'There were no tears from anyone.'\u00a0 The 'pre-wedding' that wasn't\u00a0         Meghan claimed that she and Harry were married three days before their wedding but if there really were just 'three' people present, then a legal wedding can't actually have happenedAccording to Harry and Meghan, the star-studded wedding watched by the world \u2014 and which British taxpayers funded to the tune of more than \u00a330 million \u2014 was an expensive sham.Instead, they told a slack-jawed Oprah that they'd actually plighted their troth in a secret ceremony 72 hours earlier.'Three days before our wedding, we got married,' Meghan claimed. 'No one knows that. But we called the Archbishop, and we just said: 'Look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world, but we want our union between us.''So, like, the vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury.' Harry added, singing: 'Just the three of us!'It was quite the revelation. But if there really were just 'three' people present, then a legal wedding can't actually have happened.This is because the law dictates that anyone marrying in England needs two witnesses, as well as the person officiating. In other words, at least five people must be there.Furthermore, if what Harry and Meghan told Oprah was true, it follows that the Archbishop of Canterbury, the man in charge of the worldwide Anglican communion, had not only broken the law, but then presided over a fake royal wedding at St George's Chapel, at Windsor Castle, on May 19, 2018, in the presence of the groom's grandmother, the Queen, who is the titular head of the Church of England.This didn't happen, according to the Special Licences Section of the Office of the Archbishop, which commented this week: 'A special licence was issued for the marriage in St George's.'So what really happened in the couple's 'backyard'? According to an informed source at Lambeth Palace, the episode Meghan refers to was actually a 'rehearsal' of the wedding ceremony, during which \u2014 as is normal \u2014 the couple went through their wedding vows.At its conclusion the archbishop, Justin Welby, also blessed the couple. What he did not do was marry them.\u00a0 Sibling she hasn't seen for 18 years?\u00a0         Asked about her half-sister Samantha Markle, Meghan responds: 'I think it would be very hard to tell all when you don't know me'Asked about her half-sister Samantha Markle, her father's daughter by his first marriage, who has penned a tell-all book, Meghan responds: 'I think it would be very hard to tell all when you don't know me.'She said she had grown up as an only child and had last seen her sibling, '18, 19 years ago . . . and ten years before that'.Not true, says Samantha, who has been a persistent critic of her sister, citing this graduation picture of the two of them, which she says was taken in 2008.'We've got photographs over a lifespan of us together. So how can she not know me?'Samantha also dismissed Meghan's claim that her half-sister had changed her name back to Markle \u2014 her married name was Grant \u2014 only after Harry arrived on the scene.\u00a0Samantha says the name change was in 1997 \u2014 and she has the certificate to prove it.\u00a0 Let's get the story straightStaff DID fight for them\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whatever took place during the wedding dispute, Meghan appears to have been hugely upset that the claim she'd 'made Kate cry' ended up in print.She told Oprah that she found it 'hard to get over' the Palace's failure to then put her version of events on the record.Later, she elaborated: 'They were willing to lie to protect other members of the family, but they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband.'It's unclear (because Oprah failed to ask) who exactly these 'liars' were. Or what 'lies' they supposedly told.         Meghan told Oprah that she found it 'hard to get over' the Palace's failure to then put her version of events on the recordHowever, convention would have made it impossible for royal press officers to make any comment on what was a deeply personal (and private) incident in which basic facts were likely to be in dispute.As an insider told us: 'There were clearly two versions of the same event. Whatever the institution said would only draw more attention to it.'Palace press officers are, of course, public servants. Unlike Hollywood PR agents, they cannot \u2014 and should not \u2014 contest every single false rumour.Conveniently ignored by Meghan in this whole rumpus is the fact that Palace spin-doctors did indeed go to war on her behalf on several high-profile occasions, knocking down many stories that were put to them (and were not published as a result).Notably, they formally denied stories about her alleged extravagance in the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage. They also brought two cases to the Press regulator, Ipso, on the Sussexes' behalf, winning one and losing the other.\u00a0 The truth about royal protocol and princesWhen their son was born, Harry and Meghan chose not take up his courtesy title, the Earl of Dumbarton. Neither would he be called 'Lord Archie', the established form for the son of a Duke. Instead, plain old 'Archie' would do.         According to their biographer and favoured journalist Omid Scobie, this was 'all part of giving him as normal a life as possible'.That was the story, at least. But behind the scenes, it turns out that the issue was, in fact, the subject of a furious dispute.Meghan \u2014 who elsewhere in her interview with Oprah had insisted she wasn't much bothered about titles \u2014 complained that 'they' (by which she appeared to mean Palace officials) 'didn't want him to be a Prince or Princess'.Viewers were told that this supposed snub was delivered around the same time as 'conversations about how dark his skin might be'.In other words, Meghan appeared to be suggesting that it was racially motivated.In fact, royal protocol dictates that the great-grandchild of a monarch does not normally become a Prince until their grandparent takes the throne.\u00a0Later in the interview, Meghan seems belatedly to acknowledge this fact, saying: 'There's a convention . . . I forget if it was a George V or George VI convention, that when you're the grandchild of the monarch \u2014 so when Harry's dad becomes king \u2014 automatically Archie and our next baby would become Prince or Princess.'However, she then claims plans are afoot to 'change the convention for Archie'.Indeed, Prince Charles is thought to be in favour of a slimmed-down monarchy, with fewer princes and princesses. But this shift pre-dates Harry's marriage and has nothing to do with race.\u00a0 Archie's 'dark skin': their different accountsHarry\u00a0and Meghan told Oprah at least one member of the Royal Family had expressed concern about 'how dark' their unborn baby's skin might be.It's an explosive claim. And while they were unwilling to identify the individual involved, or reveal exactly what they are supposed to have said, the ensuing row has dominated this week's news.Meghan was adamant questions about Archie's complexion were motivated by ugly racism. At one point, Oprah put to her the leading question that: 'Because they were concerned that if he were too brown, that would be a problem? Are you saying that?'         Harry and Meghan told Oprah at least one member of the Royal Family had expressed concern about 'how dark' their unborn baby's skin might beMeghan responded: 'If that's the assumption you are making, I think that feels like a pretty safe one.' It was also suggested that his skin colour was linked to decisions made about security.Buckingham Palace has sought to defuse hostilities by noting that 'recollections' of what occurred 'may vary'.That is a fair point, given the somewhat strange fact that two very different versions of events were presented to Oprah \u2014 by Harry and Meghan respectively \u2014 during their interview.Meghan claimed there were 'several conversations' about Archie's skin colour which took place 'in those months when I was pregnant'.But Harry said there was just one conversation 'right at the beginning . . . before we even got married'.A more forensic interviewer than Oprah might have queried this inconsistency. For while Harry and Meghan were 'speaking their truth', they can't both have been right.\u00a0 Therapy for Harry - but not Meghan?\u00a0         Meghan told Oprah she had begged in vain for the Palace to help when she found herself having 'suicidal thoughts' yet Harry has suffered his own mental health crises and has spoken of how, as an adult, he needed therapyMeghan told Oprah she had begged in vain for the Palace to help when she found herself having 'suicidal thoughts' and concluding that she 'just didn't want to be alive any more'.'I went to the institution, and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help,' she claimed. ' . . .I was told that I couldn't, that it wouldn't be good for the institution . . . And so I went to human resources, and I said: 'I just really, I need help.' Because in my old job, there was a union, and they would protect me.'They said: 'My heart goes out to you, because I see how bad it is, but there's nothing we can do . . . because you're not a paid employee of the institution.''This was emails and begging for help, saying very specifically: 'I am concerned for my mental welfare.''And people going: 'Oh, yes, yes, it's disproportionately terrible what we see out there to anyone else.' But nothing was ever done.'When Oprah asked if she had thought about checking in to a hospital, Meghan replied: ' . . . that's what I was asking to do . . . you can't do that. I couldn't, you know, call an Uber to the Palace.'\u00a0Oddly, Meghan was not asked why she had gone to HR, who look after Palace employees (not members of the Royal Family), instead of seeking advice from the royal doctors.         Meghan was not asked why she had gone to HR, who look after Palace employees (not members of the Royal Family), instead of seeking advice from the royal doctorsEven more curious were Harry's remarks. He told Oprah he was 'ashamed' of admitting to his family that Meghan needed help, 'had no idea what to do' and 'didn't have anyone to turn to'.\u00a0Yet Harry has suffered his own mental health crises. He has spoken of how, as an adult, he needed therapy to process his grief over the death of his mother.He has also been a passionate advocate for the mental health charity Heads Together. So it is curious that he did not advise his wife to take the same path he had once followed.\u00a0\u00a0 Trips she DID escape home for\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meghan told Oprah 'The Firm' attempted to keep her under effective house arrest.Things got to the stage, she alleged, when she said: 'I've left the house twice in four months.'A striking claim. But does it hold water?\u00a0There is no official record of her social activities, but on the work front, the Court Circular records Meghan's attendance at official engagements on 73 days in the 17 months between her wedding and the couple's departure for Canada.\u00a0         Prince Harry and Meghan Markle join the New York Yankees in their Clubhouse in 2019         The Duchess of Sussex with friends watching the Wimbledon Tennis ChampionshipsOf those days, at least 65 involved leaving her home. There are just two apparent gaps in this hectic schedule, both in 2019: from March 22 to July 6; and from July 14 to September 23.The first period includes the run-up to Archie's birth, when she travelled to hospital on May 6, plus at least four private outings: to Windsor Castle on May 8, Trooping the Colour and a baseball game in London in June, and Wimbledon on July 4.In the second period, Meghan managed to holiday abroad four times: in Italy, France, Ibiza and the U.S.\u00a0In short, there doesn't appear to be any 'four-month' period when she only left the house twice.\u00a0 No delay exposing these snapsMeghan said the Press had 'created' news about her father Thomas Markle and suggested she had 'lost' her father for ever as a result of the wrangles.Speaking about Mr Markle's notorious collaboration with paparazzi photographers, she claimed: 'The tabloids had apparently known for a month or so [about the staged pictures] and decided to hold until the Sunday before our wedding because they wanted to create drama, which is also a key point in all this; they don't report the news \u2014 they create the news.'At no stage did Oprah test these claims. If she had done so, she would have discovered a very different version of events. One in which the facts are far more compelling.         The Duchess of Sussex also spoke of her father Thomas Markle's\u00a0collaboration with paparazzi photographersIt began during the last week of March 2018, when photographs of Mr Markle began to appear in British newspapers. They had been taken in the Mexican border town of Rosarito, where the former Hollywood lighting director lives in retirement.The pictures showed Mr Markle, who until this point had said very little about his daughter's forthcoming wedding, studying a book called Images Of Britain. The inference was clear: he was reading up on his daughter's new home country.The following month, two further sets of photos were published. They showed the portly American working out with weights and being measured up by a tailor.\u00a0These, it was reported, were proof that Mr Markle was not just getting in shape for his role as father of the bride but was also having a wedding suit made.In all of them he appeared to be unaware the photographs were being taken.One further picture emerged in early May, of Meghan's father apparently in an internet cafe looking at online stories about his daughter and future son-in-law.\u00a0They emerged despite Kensington Palace warning publishers to respect Mr Markle's privacy and claiming he had been 'harassed' by the paparazzi.But by now alarm bells were beginning to sound about the pictures and how they had been obtained. The Mail on Sunday suspected they had been set up, and secured CCTV footage from the internet cafe showing Mr Markle and a photographer together.Here was proof that the two had collaborated. And, importantly, it seemed to undermine the Palace's official line. That footage was secured on May 12 and published within 24 hours.Far from 'sitting' on the story, the paper published it immediately.\u00a0 Trapped? Passport WAS used\u00a0The day Meghan joined the Royal Family was, she claimed, 'the last time, until we came here, that I saw my passport, my driver's licence, my keys. All that gets turned over'.Oprah responded to this revelation by depicting her as a sort of UK version of the incarcerated Dubai Princess Latifah: 'The way you're describing this . . . it's like you were trapped,' she said. ' . . .that would be an accurate interpretation, yes?'         Meghan suggested the couple were discriminated against when the Queen refused to allow them to combine paid work with occasional royal dutiesMeghan responded: 'That's the truth.'It was a very odd form of imprisonment then. For in the six months after her wedding, Meghan was able to use that passport to take at least four foreign holidays, in addition to official tours, visiting Italy, Canada, and Amsterdam, as well as embarking on a lengthy honeymoon.\u00a0In 2019, she visited Ibiza, France (staying chez Elton John), Italy (again) and New York twice: once for a lavish baby shower, and again to see her chum Serena Williams play in the U.S. Open.Those were just the private jaunts. She also travelled on official business to South Africa, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Ireland, Germany and Morocco.\u00a0 2018 Megxit plansWhen, exactly, did Harry and Meghan decide to leave Britain? It's as clear as mud.At one point, Meghan told Oprah she entered the royal fold intending to devote her life to service: 'Our plan was to do this for ever,' she said. 'I wrote letters to his family saying: 'I am dedicated to this. Use me as you'd like.' 'Yet later in the interview, the couple were asked whether the Queen had been 'blindsided' by their January 2020 decision to quit.'I've never blindsided my grandmother,' Harry insisted. 'I have too much respect for her.'         Meghan told Oprah she entered the royal fold intending to devote her life to service but later in the interview, the couple were asked whether the Queen had been 'blindsided' by their January 2020 decision to quitMeghan then added: 'So I remember when you talked to her several times about this [Megxit] over . . .'Harry: 'Two years.'That suggests they actually began planning to withdraw from full-time royal duties in early January 2018, some four months before they were even married. It is tricky to reconcile this with Meghan's earlier statement.Elsewhere, Meghan suggested the couple were discriminated against when the Queen refused to allow them to combine paid work with occasional royal duties, claiming 'several' family members enjoy this privilege.'I can think of so many \u2014 they're Royal Highnesses \u2014 who earn a living . . . and can support the Queen if and when called upon.'There are, in fact, only four minor royals who combine (part-time) duties with paid work: Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\u00a0 What holiday parties at the Palace?The couple said the Royal Family had an 'invisible contract', behind closed doors' with the British Press and throws parties to keep them on side.Prince Harry said: 'To simplify it . . . if you as a family member are willing to wine, dine and give full access to these reporters, then you will get better press.'Meghan described how tabloid newspapers were invited to 'holiday parties at the Palace'.         The couple said the Royal Family had an 'invisible contract' with the British Press and throw parties to keep them on sideThis was perhaps the most bizarre of the couple's claims. Again, they do not provide a shred of evidence.So let us be clear: royals do not personally entertain journalists.\u00a0And the only 'holiday parties' are occasional receptions given by the various households' communications teams and an annual cocktail party to mark the official opening to the public of Buckingham Palace.It is true that royals are sometimes present at these events, but it requires an astonishing leap of imagination to conclude that these are personal invitations from individual family members. They are not.\u00a0 UK Press accused...but here's proof CBS faked it's own news\u00a0A running theme in Sunday's interview was the host's assertion that Meghan was the victim of racism at the hands of the British press.'There were undeniable racist overtones,' Oprah insisted. 'This stands apart from the kind of coverage we've seen of any other royal.\u00a0There was constant criticism, blatant sexist and racist remarks by British tabloids.'\u00a0To illustrate Ms Winfrey's point, viewers were presented with montages of supposedly-bigoted headlines.Yet more than a third of those headlines turn out to have been from foreign publications.\u00a0For example, in a flurry of eight headlines about Meghan 'making Kate cry', five were from U.S. and Australian supermarket magazines.\u00a0              Viewers were presented with montages of supposedly-bigoted headlines but more than a third of those headlines turn out to have been from foreign publications         A montage of eight lurid headlines shown on the show all came from overseas titlesA second montage of eight lurid headlines \u2014 such as 'monster Meghan exposed' and 'Harry knocks up TV star' \u2014 all came from overseas titles.Even when Oprah did show viewers British headlines, several had been cynically edited, and in one case seemingly entirely fabricated.The programme, for example, used footage of a Guardian headline that supposedly referred neutrally to an incident when radio DJ Danny Baker posted a picture of a chimpanzee on Twitter after Archie was born.\u00a0It read: 'BBC's Danny Baker on comparing Royal Baby Archie to a chimp.' But that image appears to have been faked by Oprah's team, since no such headline has ever appeared in that paper.A Telegraph headline that reads 'The real problem with Meghan Markle: she just doesn't speak our language' was cropped by Oprah's staff in order to make it appear jingoistic.                  The show blanked out an entirely innocent word from a Mail headline and distorted the meaning of another. Pictured: The headline shown on the TV show (top) and the real headline (bottom)In fact, as the second line of the headline would have made clear (were it not deleted by Oprah's staff), the author was not mocking her race or ethnicity, but was instead making fun of her habit of using what he later called: 'hippie corporate management speak'.\u00a0Perhaps the most egregious smear revolved around a January 2018 Mail on Sunday story that lead to the resignation of (then) UKIP leader Henry Bolton. The headline used by the newspaper quoted abusive text messages Mr Bolton's girlfriend had recently written.It read: 'Meghan's seed will taint our Royal Family': UKIP chief's glamour model lover, 25, is suspended from the party over racist texts about Prince Harry's wife to be.'In a cynical attempt to portray the article as racist, the production team appear to have removed all but the first seven words, falsely suggesting that the paper had published an opinion article arguing that 'Meghan's seed will taint our Royal Family.'\u00a0 Harry DID cycle with dad         Prince Harry was a contented back-seat passenger as Prince Charles pedalled away on a bike ride with his two sons\u00a0at Sandringham in 1990When they came to discuss their new life with son Archie in California, the couple visibly relaxed. But it revealed a curious gap in Harry's memory.\u00a0'The highlight for me is sticking him on the back of the bicycle in his little baby seat and taking him on these bike rides, which is something I was never able to do when I was young.'The implication is that as a child he was never able to enjoy such freedoms \u2014 because of the ever-present Press.The truth was somewhat different. As our picture shows, Harry was a contented back-seat passenger as Prince Charles pedalled away on a bike ride with his two sons.\u00a0The photograph was taken at Sandringham in 1990, when Harry was five and William seven.A year earlier, he had again been photographed in a baby seat behind his father during a half-term holiday with his parents on Tresco in the Scilly Isles.Another charming snapshot shows the then three-year-old Prince being towed in a home-made cart by a kilt-wearing Charles during a summer break at Balmoral.         William and Harry (pictured with their father in Ballater, Scotland) enjoyed blissful childhood holidays in Scotland and Norfolk as well as at HighgroveThe fact is, William and Harry enjoyed blissful \u2014 and undisturbed \u2014 childhood holidays on the vast royal estates in Scotland and Norfolk as well as at Highgrove.Between the ages of two and six, Harry also had bucket-and-spade holidays to Majorca and later summer cruises and skiing trips.\u00a0His father accompanied him on all of them.\u00a0 Evidence to show she WAS interested in royaltyMeghan claims she never looked up her husband online, telling Oprah: 'I didn't grow up knowing much about the Royal Family.\u00a0It wasn't something that was part of conversation at home. It wasn't something that we followed.'Childhood friends remember things differently, however.         An old school-friend, Ninaki Priddy (right with Mehgan), told interviewers how they were photographed together outside Buckingham Palace in 1996One, Suzy Ardakani, has alleged that they would spend playdates watching Diana's 1981 wedding to Prince Charles.'I always loved Diana and I have her biography, which I gave Meghan to read,' Suzy's mother Sonia told the Mail in 2017.\u00a0         Another childhood friend, Suzy Ardakani, has alleged that they would spend playdates watching Diana's 1981 wedding to Prince Charles'I videoed Diana's wedding back in 1981, and I would watch it with Suzy and Meghan all those years later.\u00a0'They would also see items about her on TV.'Another old school-friend, Ninaki Priddy, told interviewers how they were photographed together outside Buckingham Palace during a 1996 visit to London: 'Meghan was always fascinated by the Royal Family. She wants to be Princess Diana 2.0.'A year later year, Princess Diana died. 'Aged 16, she watched the funeral of Diana with her friends,' biographer Andrew Morton has written, 'tears coursing down their cheeks at the poignant moment when the cameras zoomed in on the royal coffin.'Royal affairs were also discussed on Meghan's lifestyle blog The Tig when Prince William married Kate Middleton in 2011: 'Little girls dream of being princesses,' she wrote. ''And grown women seem to retain this childhood fantasy. Just look at the pomp and circumstance surrounding the Royal Wedding.'\u00a0\u00a0 Cut off? What about Diana's millions?Prince Harry\u00a0claimed that his decision to sign lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify came about because: 'My family literally cut me off financially.'Even Oprah seemed taken aback by this revelation, and queried the Prince. 'Wait a minute . . . Your family cut you off?' she asked.'Yeah,' replied Harry. 'In the first half, the first quarter of 2020,' adding: 'But I've got what my mum left me, and without that, we would not have been able to do this.'For emphasis he said of Diana: 'I think she saw it coming. And I certainly felt her presence throughout the whole process.'         Prince Harry - thanks to his family -\u00a0 is a very rich man in his own right. His fortune derives from Princess Diana's \u00a321 million estateThis claim raises several points.First: once Harry, a family man who was approaching middle age, decided to opt out of being a 'working royal', there was no obvious reason why his family should have continued to provide him with financial support.Second: he was not exactly 'cut off'. Instead, according to informed sources, he received a lump sum from Prince Charles in late March 2020 (towards the end of the 2019-2020 financial year) after announcing his decision to step aside.This, we are told, was a sum of 'many hundreds of thousands of pounds'. It seems to have been made over to him not as a final pay-off, but to meet the costs of his new life in America going forward.\u00a0         Former Suits star Meghan Markle has a reported personal wealth of \u00a33 millionIn other words, it was money for the year ahead, until, as a source puts it, 'they sorted themselves out'.Additionally, we are told, it was made clear to the couple there would be more resources \u2014 if required \u2014 in the next financial year.So what is the truth about Harry and his money? The simple fact is that \u2014 thanks to his family \u2014 he is a very rich man in his own right. Indeed, almost his every expense, until a year ago, was met by Prince Charles.As a result, he has barely had to touch his considerable personal savings until now.His fortune derives from Princess Diana's \u00a321 million estate. After attracting \u00a38 million inheritance tax, the balance of almost \u00a313 million was split evenly between William and Harry, who were 15 and 12 when she died in 1997.The money was invested for the boys by royal advisers, with Harry's share thought to be worth at least \u00a312 million.He was also a beneficiary of his great-grandmother the Queen Mother's will. Known as the Queen Elizabeth Trust Fund this, we understand, provided him with \u00a32 million.Meghan also has a reported personal wealth of \u00a33 million.However, the couple's decision to buy a vast home in an exclusive enclave has left them needing to earn more. Or, as one aide puts it: 'No one told Harry he had to spend \u00a311 million on a mansion with 16 bathrooms. That was his choice.'\u00a0 Not the only royals with securityMeghan insisted that as a former waitress and actress, the 'grandeur' of royal titles held no attachment to her \u2014 until she discovered it meant Archie would not get his own security detail unless he was a prince.\u00a0She says she was informed in the 'last few months of our pregnancy' that 'he wasn't going to receive security'.But her claims are hotly disputed by royal officials.\u00a0One described her logic as 'ridiculous', saying it had always been made clear that as long as Harry was a working royal, he, his wife and their children would receive security from Scotland Yard's royal protection squad.         Meghan says she was informed in the 'last few months of our pregnancy' that\u00a0Archie would not get his own security detail unless he was a prince but her claims are hotly disputed by royal officialsThere is a precedent for this: 24-hour protection was given to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, daughters of the (then) working royal Prince Andrew, until 2011 when, following a review of their protection, it was withdrawn.During the interview, Harry further claimed it was while he and Meghan were in Canada, during the early part of last year, that he received 'short notice' their security 'was going to be removed'. He said he was told this reflected their 'change in status', and he demanded to know if there had been a 'change of threat or risk'.He told Oprah: 'I never thought that I would have my security removed because I was born into this position \u2014 I inherited the risk. So that was a shock to me. That was what completely changed the whole plan.'In truth, the decision to remove publicly funded security was a political one.The Sussexes continued to be protected by a team of six Scotland Yard officers during the first part of their exile in Canada.\u00a0But once it became clear they were no longer working royals and wanted to be private citizens, it became impossible for the Palace to argue that taxpayers should foot the bill. Canada, too, baulked at having to pick up the estimated \u00a31 million annual cost.A more balanced interviewer than Oprah might have asked Harry why he believed the UK should pay for his police protection, once he had stopped serving the Crown. After all, there are plenty of royals (including Princess Anne and Prince Edward) who do not enjoy round-the-clock protection.Furthermore, Harry appears to have mythologised the idea that security was removed from his mother \u2014 leading to her death \u2014 when, in fact, Diana asked for it to be taken away, several years before her fatal accident.\u00a0          more videos           1   2   3                   Watch video  BBC's Charlie Stayt and Naga Munchetty mock Jenrick's 'small' flag       Watch video  Question Time audience member bravely details knife attack       Watch video  Young boy survives horrific fall from 23rd floor window       Watch video  Roofer unwittingly leaves voicemail insulting woman's appearance           Watch video  Donkey forces cow away from its food with powerful back kicks       Watch video  Food blogger on TikTok shares hack to keep lettuce fresh       Watch video  Robert Jenrick says UK still on course to end lockdown by June       Watch video  Brawl breaks out after anti-maskers force passengers off plane           Watch video  Woman breaks down in tears as she claims Armie Hammer raped her       Watch video  CCTV captures moment thief attempts to snatch phone but fails       Watch video  'Appalling': Patel condemns Boris's 'pat her on the bottom' comment       Watch video  Makeup artist shares her ultimate blush hack",

        "title": "Kenyan runner convicted of doping offense in criminal court",
        "full article": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - A female runner became the first athlete in Kenya to be convicted of a doping offense in a criminal court on Friday. Distance runner Florence Jepkosgei Chepsoi, who finished second at the 2019 Jakarta Marathon, was sentenced to one year of community service after she was found guilty of presenting false documents and lying to the Kenyan anti-doping agency at a hearing. She changed her plea to guilty having initially pleaded not guilty when she was first charged in court last year. Kenya criminalized doping offenses in 2016 in the midst of a stream of drug scandals among its world-renowned distance runners. The East African nation updated its anti-doping laws late last year. Chepsoi was initially charged with doping by the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya in 2017 after testing positive for the banned steroid prednisolone at a race in China. When she appeared before a tribunal, she presented documents she claimed were from a hospital as part of her defense. ADAK found the documents were forgeries and Chepsoi had never been treated at the hospital, leading the anti-doping body to push for her to be prosecuted in a criminal court. It's rare for an athlete to face criminal charges for doping offenses, although Chepsoi is not the first worldwide. Criminal prosecutors normally target people such as doctors and other support staff who facilitate doping in what they refer to as doping conspiracies rather than the athletes themselves. The World Anti-Doping Agency recommends athletes do not face criminal prosecution for doping. The United States passed a law in December that criminalized doping conspiracies and allows U.S. prosecutors to go after doping schemes at international events in which Americans are involved as athletes, sponsors or broadcasters. The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act was named after Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Moscow lab director who helped uncover state-sponsored doping by Russian athletes. However, the Rodchenko Act makes clear that individual athletes are not subject to prosecution. ADAK said more athletes would \"face the law\" for doping in the coming days. Four other Kenyan athletes are facing criminal charges for doping offenses. ___ More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

        "full article": "Devonte' Graham's return after missing almost a month with a knee injury gave the Charlotte Hornets three healthy guards capable of starting. However, third-year Hornets coach James Borrego wants to keep rookie LaMelo Ball in the starting lineup. And for now, Borrego is going with Terry Rozier among his starting five and bringing Graham in off the bench. Rozier, who is playing some of the best basketball of his career, saved his best for late in the game on Thursday night, scoring 12 of Charlotte's final 15 points in a 105-102 win over the Detroit Pistons. The Hornets won for the third time in their past four games and will try to keep gaining momentum when they host the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night in the second of a three-game homestand. The Raptors swept the Hornets in a back-to-back set in Tampa on Jan. 14 and 16, winning each game by three points. Rozier finished with 17 points and has averaged 23.5 points on 51.9 percent shooting including 44.3 percent from 3-point range over his previous 13 games. Rozier struggled early against Detroit but made four of his last five shots. \"That is what separates the good from the greats,\" Rozier said. \"If you want to be great you have to have that confidence down the stretch.\" Graham played more than 18 minutes and finished with seven points and six assists as Borrego said he plans to roll with the starting five of Ball, Rozier, Gordon Hayward, PJ Washington and Cody Zeller. \"He's very comfortable in those moments,\" Borrego said regarding Graham. \"It's almost like he is more locked in the tighter the game is. That's rare at any level, much less at this level.\" Toronto has lost five of its past six games and blew a 15-point lead in the final six minutes before losing 121-120 to the Atlanta Hawks in Tampa on Thursday on Tony Snell's three-pointer at the buzzer. Norman Powell finished with 33 points and Chris Boucher scored 29 points and grabbed nine rebounds off the bench to follow up a 30-point game he had March 4. \"We just needed one more play anywhere we could find one, one more bucket,\" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. \"One more bucket probably puts the game away or one more stop probably puts the game away, and we just unfortunately didn't find it because the guys played their guts out.\" Kyle Lowry moved into second place on the Raptors' all-time scoring list with 10,292 points, surpassing Chris Bosh (10,275). Lowry, who had 17 points and 12 assists, now trails only DeMar DeRozan (13,296). The Raptors have been depleted since before the break due to the NBA's COVID-19 protocols and again played without Pascal Siakam, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby. Nurse hinted that Toronto could be without them as well as reserves Malachi Flynn and Patrick McCaw for as many as two more games. Toronto did get Nurse back after he missed the two previous games for the same reason. But five members of his staff remained out. \"I think that's going to be the smart thing to do and try to figure out, like always, to get us safely to the end, get us playing our best at the end and get us in at the end so we have a chance,\" Nurse said. --Field Level Media",

That pressure isn't dissuading bettors, with Gonzaga (+225) being backed by 38.3 percent of the total NCAA Tournament handle at BetRivers. That's more than three times the handle of the next closest team, with Michigan (+450) the second-most-backed team to win the title at the sportsbook.

Rock pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis renews marriage vows with seventh wife American rock 'n' roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis, 85, renewed marriage vows with his seventh wife on their ninth anniversary, weeks after getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Rev. Donnie Swaggart, son of the televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who is Lewis' cousin, officiated on Tuesday. The couple held hands in the living room of Lewis Ranch, a tourist attraction where they live part time in Nesbit, Mississippi. Meghan complains to UK regulator over TV host Piers Morgan Meghan, the wife of Prince Harry, has complained to Britain's media regulator about broadcaster Piers Morgan and his comment that he did not believe a word she had said in her landmark interview with Oprah Winfrey. Morgan, a former tabloid editor and CNN presenter, left his high-profile job on ITV's \"Good Morning Britain\" this week after a backlash against his comments on the interview, in which Meghan revealed she had felt suicidal while living as a royal in Britain. NHS workers, Osaka and Westwood among women honoured at Glamour Awards Frontline workers for Britain's National Health Service, tennis player Naomi Osaka and designer Vivienne Westwood were among those honoured at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards on Thursday, in a virtual event which paid tribute to those who have sought to incite change. Hosted by comedian Katherine Ryan and streamed on the UK magazine's website, the event was renamed Glamour's Women of the Year Awards 2021: The Gamechangers, with winners swapping the usual red carpet for acceptance speeches by video. Sotheby's to auction rare stamps, gold coin from Stuart Weitzman's personal collection A 'Three Treasures' sale of rare stamps and a gold coin from the personal collection of shoe designer Stuart Weitzman is set to fetch millions of dollars at an auction at Sotheby's in New York City in June. The 1933 Double Eagle Coin was originally cast as a $20 coin, but it was never issued for use. After U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard, all of the Double Eagles were ordered destroyed. However, a handful were released and all but one of them deemed stolen. Popularity of Harry and Meghan plummets in UK after Oprah interview, poll says The popularity of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan has tumbled in Britain and has never been lower following their explosive interview with U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey, according to a poll on Friday. During the interview aired last Sunday, Meghan said her pleas for help while she felt suicidal were ignored and that one unnamed member of the family had asked how dark their son Archie\u00b4s skin might be.",

        "title": "'Gonna be sore:' La. troopers boasted of beating Black man",
        "full article": "Louisiana State Police troopers joked in a group text about beating a Black man after a high-speed chase last year, saying the \"whoopin\" would give the man \"nightmares for a long time,\" according to new court filings. \"He gonna be sore tomorrow for sure,\" Trooper Jacob Brown, who was charged in the case and resigned Wednesday, texted three of his colleagues. \"Warms my heart knowing we could educate that young man.\" The May arrest of 29-year-old Antonio Harris - who authorities say was beaten by troopers even after he \"immediately surrendered\" - bears a strong resemblance to the State Police pursuit a year earlier that ended in the still-unexplained death of another Black motorist, Ronald Greene. Greene's death was captured on body-worn camera footage the agency refuses to release and remains the subject of a federal civil rights investigation. Brown, 30, who faces charges in two other excessive-force cases, had pulled Harris over for a minor traffic violation on Interstate 20 in Richland Parish when Harris reentered his vehicle and fled, State Police said. The ensuing chase spanned 29 miles (47 kilometers), reached speeds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and ended only after deputy sheriffs deployed a \"tire deflation device\" that caused Harris to drive into a ditch, the court records show.

New court filings show Louisiana State Police troopers joked in a group text about beating a Black man after a high-speed chase last year, saying the beating would give the man \"nightmares for a long time.\" The May 2020 arrest of Antonio Harris bears strong resemblance to the State Police pursuit a year earlier that ended in the still-unexplained death of Ronald Greene. (Ouachita Correctional Center and Franklin Parish Sheriff's Office via AP)  An internal investigation found the responding troopers, who are white, attacked Harris even though he had surrendered and \"laid face down (prone) on the ground and extended his arms away from his body and his legs spread apart.\" The first arriving trooper, Dakota DeMoss, \"delivered a knee strike\" to Harris and slapped him in the face with an open palm before powering off his body-worn camera, the court records show. DeMoss, 28, also initiated Greene\u00b4s arrest in May 2019, though State Police have not provided any details about his involvement. Another trooper, George Harper, 26, punched Harris in the head several times with a fist \"reinforced\" by a flashlight and threatened to \"punish\" Harris, while Brown pulled the man's hair. \"At no time did Harris resist arrest,\" the State Police internal investigation concluded. The troopers produced \"wholly untrue\" reports saying Harris was resisting and continuing to flee, the filings say, and they sought to conceal from investigators that there was bodycam video. They also exchanged 14 text messages peppered with \"lol\" and \"haha\" responses in which they boasted about the beating and mocked Harris. \"BET he wont run from a full grown bear again,\" Brown wrote. \"Bet he don't even cross into LA anymore,\" DeMoss responded, who earlier jeered that Harris was \"still digesting that ass whoopin.\" \"He gonna spread the word that's for damn sure,\" Harper texted back. DeMoss and Harper also are charged in Harris' arrest and were placed on administrative leave after the internal investigation. The filings show DeMoss originally received only counseling for his role in Harris\u00b4 beating, admonished for turning his FM radio up \"extremely loud\" during the chase and switching stations \"in order to find the right song.\" A message sent to the attorney for the other troopers was not immediately returned. Brown\u00b4s attorney declined to comment. Efforts to reach Harris, who appears to be from Mississippi, were not immediately successful. The new court filings were first reported by Sound Off Louisiana, a local blog. Harris' arrest drew new attention after a monthslong internal investigation into use-of-force incidents in the northern part of the state - a probe begun amid mounting scrutiny of the agency\u00b4s Troop F, which patrols the Monroe area and the surrounding parishes. Brown and another trooper, Randall Dickerson, 34, are also charged in a July 2019 drug arrest of another Black man after a traffic stop on Interstate 20 in Ouachita Parish. Body-worn camera captured Dickerson striking the man five times \"towards his head and administering a knee strike to his body,\" according to court records. Brown also was arrested in December on battery and malfeasance charges in another incident involving a man who says authorities followed him to his house, dragged him from his car and beat and kicked him, breaking his ribs. Federal authorities separately are investigating troopers from the same troop in the death of Greene. Troopers initially blamed 49-year-old's death on a crash at the end of a high-speed chase. But photos of Greene's car showed little damage and his family's attorney says bodycam footage shows troopers choking and beating the man, repeatedly jolting him with stun guns and dragging him face-down across the pavement.

        "full article": "Todd Dunivant and the rest of the Sacramento Republic FC staff arrived at work on Feb. 26 believing it was a standard Friday: prepare for the upcoming USL season to start in May and continue the work on the club\u00b4s Major League Soccer expansion plans. By the end of the day, the plans to join MLS were completely altered, and almost derailed. \"It was unexpected news right when we found out, when the league found out that the previous investor was pulling out,\" Dunivant said. \"It caught everybody by surprise. There was initial shock and obviously a lot of of impact.\" It\u00b4s been a couple of weeks now since Ron Burkle announced he was backing out as the lead investor for the Sacramento expansion team, leaving the city, staff and league scrambling to find stable footing for what was expected to be the 30th MLS franchise. Dunivant already had plenty on his plate as the general manager of the USL club, then he was named president a few days after Burkle\u00b4s announcement when Ben Gumpert announced he was resigning as president and chief operating officer. For the past two weeks, Dunivant has been having meetings, making calls and trying to land a new lead investor, or investors, to keep the expansion franchise from going elsewhere.

(AP Photo/Danny Moloshok, File)  \"There\u00b4s already been inbound interest that\u00b4s come to us and we\u00b4re having active conversations with folks that are interested in Sacramento and MLS,\" said Dunivant, who played 13 seasons in MLS, mostly with the LA Galaxy. \"I think for us, it\u00b4s telling that story. This is a project unlike any other and the large the bulk of the work has been done.\" MLS announced the Sacramento Republic as its 29th team on Oct. 21, 2019, saying the team would start play in 2022. Last summer, the league announced Sacramento would not start play until the 2023 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, the league delayed Charlotte, North Carolina, until 2022 and St. Louis until 2023. Sacramento\u00b4s announced ownership group included Burkle, founder of The Yucaipa Cos. and an owner of the NHL\u00b4s Pittsburgh Penguins. He was joined by entertainment executive Matt Alvarez and Kevin Nagle, an investor in the NBA\u00b4s Sacramento Kings who had spearheaded the bid for MLS expansion since 2014. The centerpiece of the franchise launch will be a 21,000-seat stadium, part of Sacramento\u00b4s Railyards redevelopment project that will expand the downtown core. The price tag of the stadium was first targeted for $300 million but rising construction costs and delays due to the pandemic seemed to be part of the underlying reasons for Burkle\u00b4s withdrawal. Nagle, who owns the USL franchise, has remained a major proponent and supporter in the effort to find a lead investor, Dunivant said. The team also has received strong support from Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, who has repeatedly referenced the city\u00b4s efforts to keep the Kings from moving to Seattle nearly a decade ago. The major unknown is how long MLS will wait for the franchise to put together a new lead investor group when so many other cities seem to be chomping for a chance at an expansion team. Commissioner Don Garber expressed his support for the Sacramento market and the league seems to be willing to give Dunivant some time to find a solution. \"Our focus is let\u00b4s take the urgency and the momentum that we have right now of finding that investor and the positive conversations we\u00b4ve had and let\u00b4s seize it,\" Dunivant said. \"We see urgency on this and we have a shovel-ready project, we have the pieces in place and we need that final piece of the investor.\" ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports          FILE - In this April 18, 2019, file photo, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber speaks at a news conference in Los Angeles.

        "full article": "China's national flag is displayed at a stall in Hong Kong as residents are asked to show support for controversial election changes seen as stifling dissent in the financial hub  Group of Seven powers on Friday demanded that China honor commitments in Hong Kong and end \"oppression\" against democratic activists after Beijing forced sweeping changes of the city's election system. Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament on Thursday passed reforms that said that only \"patriots\" can run the city, which was guaranteed a separate system before Britain handed over control in 1997. \"Such a decision strongly indicates that the authorities in mainland China are determined to eliminate dissenting voices and opinions in Hong Kong,\" Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States as well as the European Union said in a joint statement. The G7's top diplomats said they \"call on China and the Hong Kong authorities to restore confidence in Hong Kong's political institutions and end the unwarranted oppression of those who promote democratic values.\" \"The people of Hong Kong should be trusted to cast their votes in the best interests of Hong Kong. Discussion of differing views, not silencing of them, is the way to secure the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,\" they said. Beijing has brushed aside earlier international warnings on Hong Kong and last year pushed through a draconian security bill used to detain activists. The actions came after Hong Kong was rocked by massive and sometimes violent protests in 2019 against Beijing's encroachment on the financial hub's unique freedoms.",

'They're investors, they're tech entrepreneurs, they're in that world.'Spalter said she expects this bubble to pop, though she still believes NFTs hold promise for artists as a way to reduce fraud and misattribution of works.'I'm still mystified by the prices and how high they are,' she said. 'I think there will be a correction.' What is the 'NFT' craze all about? A digital art piece, tweaked using cryptocurrency technology to make it one-of-a-kind, sold at auction this week for nearly $70 million. That transaction made global headlines and buoyed already-mushrooming interest in these kinds of digital objects - known as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs - that have captured the attention of artists and collectors alike.WHAT IS A NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN?In economics jargon, a fungible token is an asset that can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. Think of dollars or bitcoins - each one has the exact same value and can be traded freely. A non-fungible object, by contrast, has its own distinct value, like an old house or a classic car.Cross this notion with cryptocurrency technology known as the blockchain and you get NFTs. These are effectively digital certificates of authenticity that can be attached to digital art or, well, pretty much anything else that comes in digital form - audio files, video clips, animated stickers, this article you're reading.NFTs confirm an item's ownership by recording the details on a digital ledger known as a blockchain, which is public and stored on computers across the internet, making it effectively impossible to lose or destroy.At the moment, these tokens are white-hot in the collecting world, where they're being used to solve a problem central to digital collectibles: how to claim ownership of something that can be easily and endlessly duplicated.WHAT RIGHTS DOES AN NFT CONVEY?Anyone can download a copy of Beeple's art from his social media feed, print it out, and hang it on the wall. Just like you can take a photo of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre or buy a print from the museum gift shop. But that doesn't mean you own those original artworks.One purpose of NFTs is that they can be used to trace an object's digital provenance, allowing a select few to prove ownership. In the broader picture, it's a way to create scarcity -- albeit artificial - so that you can sell something for higher prices thanks to its scarcity.'All the time, money and effort you spend in your digital life, you can create value for that,' said Chicago fund manager Andrew Steinwold, who started an NFT fund in 2019. 'You have property rights in the physical world. Why don\u00b4t we have property rights in the digital world?'Some NFT issuers give full copyrights to the buyer, though others do not.WHO ELSE IS SELLING NFTs?William Shatner of 'Star Trek' fame sold 90,000 virtual trading cards last year for $1 each. Electronic musician Grimes sold $6 million worth of her digital art last month, including a video clip featuring winged cherubs floating in pastel dreamscapes that went for $389,000.\u00a0Clips of NBA star LeBron James dunking are selling for as much as $225,000.

        "full article": "COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) - Right guard Trai Turner was released by the Los Angeles Chargers on Friday, less than a year after he was acquired in a trade from the Carolina Panthers. Turner was a five-time Pro Bowl selection with the Panthers but didn't have the same success with the Chargers. He missed seven games last season because of knee and groin injuries. Turner started at right guard and allowed 19 quarterback pressures last season (one sack, two quarterback hits and 16 hurries). The Chargers offensive line yielded the fourth-most hurries in the league last year. His $11.5 million salary cap number would have been the sixth-highest on the roster going into the start of free agency on Wednesday. Los Angeles has approximately $38.1 million in cap space, which places it among the top seven teams in the league. Offensive line will be a major priority for general manager Tom Telesco and new head coach Brandon Staley over the next two months. Right tackle Bryan Bulaga is the only regular starter remaining with center Dan Feeney, guard Forrest Lamp and left tackle Sam Tevi slated to be unrestricted free agents. Besides free agency, the Chargers will have the 13th overall selection in a draft that is considered to have a deep group of offensive linemen. \"I don\u00b4t know if the whole offensive line is deep in the draft, but there are certain areas that are better than others,\" Telesco said last week about this year's draft class. \"We look at it probably different than you would. I know that the focus is on the first round, but we\u00b4re looking through all seven rounds and trying to see where the depth is in different positions. It looks pretty good.\"          FILE - In this Dec. 13, 2020, file photo, Los Angeles Chargers offensive guard Trai Turner (70) blocks during an NFL football game against the Atlanta Falcons in Inglewood, Calif.

The incident occurred Thursday before the Norman High School-Midwest City quarterfinal game in Sapulpa as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" began to play. The broadcasters told their listeners on the NFHS Network stream that they would return after a break. Then one, apparently not realizing the audio was still live, used an expletive and the epithet as the Norman players kneeled. \"They\u00b4re kneeling? (Expletive) them,\" one of the men said. \"I hope Norman gets their ass kicked ... (Expletive) (epithet).\" Matt Rowan, the owner and operator of the streaming service OSPN, told The Oklahoman he was the person who made the racially insensitive remarks. Rowan apologized Friday and blamed his use of racist language on his blood-sugar levels. \"I will state that I suffer Type 1 Diabetes, and during the game my sugar was spiking,\" Rowan said in a statement. \"While not excusing my remarks, it is not unusual when my sugar spikes that I become disoriented and often say things that are not appropriate as well as hurtful. I do not believe that I would have made such horrible statements absent my sugar spiking.\" The Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activities Association and NFHS Network each issued statements apologizing for the comments. \"While we are currently investigating the incident, this crew will not be doing any more games for the remainder of our championships,\" OSSAA director David Jackson said. \"This kind of behavior will never be tolerated by anyone representing the NFHS or OSSAA.\" The NFHS Networks said in a statement that it was \"sickened\" and \"outraged\" by the comments, apologized and \"immediately cut ties with the third-party production crew that was involved.\" \"We also deeply apologize to the students, their families, and the entire community for having such ignorant and hurtful comments expressed during the broadcast,\" the statement added. Kneeling during the anthem during U.S. sporting events has become a familiar way for athletes to express themselves, often protesting racial or social injustice. Norman High School Superintendent Nick Migliorino said the school district supports the students' right to freely express themselves. \"We condemn and will not tolerate the disgusting words and attitudes of these announcers,\" Migliorno said. \"We will do everything in our power to support and uplift our team and everyone affected by this incident.\" Migliorino said the OSSAA hired the announcers and that the district would use another live stream service for the remainder of the state tournament. State public schools Superintendent Joy Hofmeister also released a statement, saying the comments cannot be tolerated. \"The remarks made were sickening and vile,\" Hofmeister said. \"My heart aches for the young female athletes who were subjected to this hateful and disgusting tirade.\"",

        "title": "Union seeks vote of 87 workers at Nissan Tennessee plant",
        "full article": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A union wants to hold a vote for representation of fewer than 100 workers out of thousands at the Nissan vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee, a move the company opposes because the effort doesn't stretch more broadly across the facility's workforce. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers says an overwhelming majority of the 87 tool and die maintenance technicians at Nissan's plant in Smyrna, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Nashville, have signaled their support for unionization. The effort marks the latest foray in the uphill fight for unions to gain traction at foreign-owned auto assembly plants in the traditionally anti-union South. Whether or not a vote can be held hinges on ongoing arguments in front of the National Labor Relations Board. An attorney for Nissan argued that the employees are not sufficiently distinct from other plant workers during a virtual hearing Friday, reasoning that any unionization vote would need to extend to about 4,300 production and maintenance employees. An attorney for the union contended that the 87 employees have extremely specialized skills for a job that others at the plant cannot do, making them eligible for their own standalone union representation. Nissan does work with organized labor in the rest of the world, but votes to unionize broadly at the U.S. two plants have not been close. Workers in Smyrna rejected a plantwide union under the United Auto Workers in 2001 and 1989. The Japan-based automaker's other U.S. assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi, rejected facilitywide representation by the UAW during a 2017 vote. \"Our history reflects that Nissan respects the right of employees to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace,\" Nissan Smyrna spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter said. \"Nissan employees have a very long history of self-representation and voting no to unions.\"          FILE - In this May 15, 2012, file photo, a worker walks by a new Nissan Altima on the line after the company celebrated the start of production of the fifth generation of the model at the plant in Smyrna, Tenn. A union wants to hold a vote for representation of fewer than 100 out of thousands of workers at the Nissan vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee, a move the company opposes because the effort doesn't stretch more broadly across the facility's workforce. The National Labor Relations Board began hearing arguments Friday, March 12, 2021, in a case over whether a vote can be held for the subset of employees. (AP Photo/Erik Schelzig, File)  The margin was much closer in 2019 and 2014 votes at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where workers twice rejected a factorywide union under the UAW. The year after the 2014 vote failed, a group of 160 Chattanooga maintenance workers won a vote to form a smaller union, but Volkswagen refused to bargain. The German automaker had argued the bargaining unit needed to include production workers as well. The dust-up led to the 2019 factorywide vote. Unions also have run into opposition from Republican politicians when they attempt to organize at foreign automakers in the South. Before the 2019 Volkswagen vote, Republican Gov. Bill Lee told employees there in a closed-door meeting that he believes \"when I have a direct relationship with you, the worker, and you\u00b4re working for me, that is when the environment works the best.\" During the 2014 Volkswagen election, then-U.S. Sen. Bob Corker waited until voting had actually started when he all but guaranteed that the company would announce within two weeks of a union rejection that it would build a new midsized sport utility vehicle at its only U.S. factory, instead of sending the work to Mexico. At the Nissan plant this time around, the machinists union says workers have cited numerous workplace concerns, from forced overtime to increased health care costs. Laura Ewan, an attorney representing the union, said the workers were excluded from a buyout offer to plant employees in general because of issues hiring people for the specialized jobs. \"A union contract will ensure fair wages, benefits, working conditions and the ability to retire with dignity,\" said lead campaign organizer Tim Wright, machinists union Grand Lodge representative. Tennessee does have a big union presence at an American automaker. The General Motors plant in Spring Hill has about 3,000 production and skilled trades workers represented by UAW. The machinists union represents about 47,000 tool and die makers and 3,000 automotive manufacturing workers at companies that includes Ford, Penske Truck, Hyundai and Chevrolet.",

        "full article": "After a successful road trip that ended a little bit rocky, the Tampa Bay Lightning are ready to return to the Sunshine State for some home cooking. The Lightning earned nine points in their six-game road trip (4-1-1) through Dallas, Chicago and Detroit, but they slipped some by splitting their last four games. Trailing first-place Carolina by one point in the Central Division and tied with Florida with 38 points entering Friday's games, the Lightning have a chance to bolster their position when they host the Nashville Predators on Saturday night in the first of two games. After Monday's game against Nashville, they will travel for a one-off match Tuesday at Dallas -- rescheduled from Feb. 20 -- to give them a stretch of three contests in four days. Tampa Bay is 4-0-0 against the Predators this season -- dominating the scoreboard by a 19-7 margin -- and holds a 9-1-0 home mark. In capitalizing on many of their chances Thursday night, the last-place Red Wings built a 5-2 lead before Brayden Point and Ondrej Palat cut Tampa Bay's deficit to 5-4. But former Lightning center Vladislav Namestnikov tallied into an empty net to ice the win. The game was monumental because it ended an incredible run by the Lightning over struggling Detroit. The defeat was Tampa Bay's first in regulation against the Red Wings since Nov. 3, 2015 -- a stretch in which the visitors went 19-0-1 in the series. \"We didn't score on our chances, and they scored on almost every chance they had,\" said Palat, who has 11 goals, one behind team leader Steven Stamkos. \"I don't think we played that bad, and we are still going home with nine points out of 12 on this road trip.\" The Predators have played poorly through a six-game skid (1-4-1) and capped it with a terrible showing Thursday night against the Carolina Hurricanes, who easily claimed the 5- 1 victory. Coach John Hynes' team trailed 5-0 in the third period before Nick Cousins netted his third goal with 4:32 left. That prevented Nashville from being shut out for the third time in what has become a difficult season. \"It was a couple of bad minutes,\" said Hynes after his team trailed 3-0 following 20 minutes of play. \"We unraveled those first few minutes there.\" With No. 1 goalie Juuse Saros still on the mend and having missed five games, Hynes said the schedule shakes out for him to lean solely on 38-year-old Pekka Rinne for the foreseeable future. When the Hurricanes worked their way to a five-goal advantage, Hynes used the remaining time to rest Rinne by replacing him with 27-year-old fellow Finnish backstop Kasimir Kaskisuo, who stopped all three shots he faced in 15:22 of ice time. \"I think the schedule lends itself to be able to play one goalie,\" Hynes said. \"And Peks has played well. I thought even tonight he played well. I don't think he even had a chance on a couple of the goals. ... I thought five (goals allowed) was enough.\" In 18 games played (15 starts) this season, Rinne -- the 2017-18 Vezina Trophy winner -- is 6-10-1 with a 3.10 goals against average and an .897 save percentage. --Field Level Media",

        "title": "Labor movement targets Amazon as a foothold in the South",
        "full article": "BESSEMER, Ala. (AP) - The South has never been hospitable to organized labor. But that may be changing, with an important test in Alabama, where thousands of workers at an Amazon campus are deciding whether to form a union. Labor organizers and advocates see the David-and-Goliath fight as a potential turning point in the region with a long history of undervalued labor and entrenched hostility to collective bargaining rights. A win could have economic and political ripples for the labor movement and its Democratic Party allies who want a stronger foothold in the South amid decades of dwindling union power nationally. \"This election transcends this one workplace. It even transcends this one powerful company,\" said Stuart Appelbaum, national president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. \"If workers at Amazon in Alabama, in the middle of the pandemic, can organize then that means that workers anywhere can organize.\" The mere presence of a national union figure like Appelbaum in Alabama underscores the stakes. The Amazon vote comes as Democrats and Republicans are battling fiercely for working-class voters. Over decades, many white workers have drifted toward Republicans, attracted in part by cultural identity and an anti-establishment posture. That's left Democrats looking to refine their economic pitch, arguing their party is the one fighting for higher wages, better working conditions and more affordable health care. A win in Bessemer, where the vast majority of the workforce is Black, would have additional significance as a launchpad for new political organizing in the South, where Democrats want to build on recent successes.          Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala, in the center wearing red, and Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., at the far right, join fellow members of Congress, labor organizers and employees at an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Ala., on March 5, 2021. The nearly 6,000 workers at the plant are voting on whether to form a union. The election is the largest unionizing effort ever for Amazon, one of the world's wealthiest firms, and would be a major victory for organized labor and its Democratic Party allies as the labor movement tries to reverse decades of declining membership nationally. (AP Photo/Bill Barrow)  That could prove decisive in newfound battlegrounds like Georgia, which Biden pulled into the party's presidential column for the first time since 1992 and where Democrats won two Senate races. It could be a building block in GOP-dominated states like Alabama and Mississippi. And any domino effect nationally could boost Democrats in old industrial Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, where Republicans have gained ground. Biden drew plaudits from labor leaders with a recent video address pushing the right to organize through \"free and fair elections,\" although he did not directly mention the Amazon campaign. The ongoing mail vote by almost 6,000 workers is the largest union push ever at Amazon, one of the world\u00b4s wealthiest companies. The election, which runs through March, also ranks among the largest single organizing efforts in Southern history. It follows a series of failed organizing votes at automobile assembly plants -- Nissan in Mississippi in 2017, Volkswagen in Tennessee in 2019, among others -- that have flocked to the region over the last three decades. \"Wages in this region have been depressed from the time of slavery,\" said historian Keri Leigh Merritt, because \"we\u00b4ve always had these competing underclasses of different races that white elites,\" from the South and elsewhere, \"have been able to play off each other.\" The result, Merritt said, is nearly all laborers being paid \"below the national market.\" The 2019 median household income in the U.S. was of $62,843, according to Census Bureau data. In Bessemer, part of an industrialized swath outside of Birmingham that once teemed with steel mills, that figure was $32,301. \"We just want what\u00b4s owed to us,\" said Kevin Jackson, a worker at the distribution center. Jackson, who is Black, compared Amazon wages, which start at $15 an hour, about double minimum wage, to the fortune of company founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, whose net worth measures in the hundreds of billions. \"When you kick a dog so many times, he\u00b4s going to bite,\" Jackson said. \"We\u00b4re biting back.\" The union's election overlaps with Biden and Democrats in Congress pushing the \"PRO Act,\" legislation that would overhaul labor law to make organizing easier. The bill represents the most significant labor law change since the New Deal era and follows a decades-long slide in union membership. In 1970, almost a third of the U.S. workforce were unionized. In 2020, that number was 10.8%. The House approved the overhaul Tuesday on a largely party line vote, but it faces almost certain defeat in the 50-50 Senate where major bills require at least 10 Republican votes to avoid a filibuster. Even without that law, labor leaders say the Amazon result could be a springboard for labor organizing nationwide. Regionally, a win would provide a roadmap for a Southern workforce unaccustomed to unions as a routine part of the economy. Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said the Alabama workers are \"inspiring,\" and added that her union and others are watching closely as they mull expansion. Organized labor\u00b4s Southern deficit is glaring: all 11 states of the old Confederacy have so-called \"right to work\" laws, which allow workers in unionized shops to opt out of paying union dues even as they retain the benefits and job protection negotiated by the union. That weakens unions by reducing their membership and their negotiating leverage. Most Southern states also bar public employees from collective bargaining. The entire region lags national union membership when measured as a percentage of the workforce. For example, the United Auto Workers has more than 400,000 members, but just 12,000 in Southern states, despite the region\u00b4s abundance of internationally owned auto plants and associated suppliers. Merritt, an expert on Southern labor politics, drew a straight line from the pre-Civil War economy to the current climate. Before slavery\u00b4s abolition, she said, white workers were threatened -- explicitly or implicitly -- with being replaced by slaves, stripping them of any leverage with employers. After emancipation, free Black laborers and poor white laborers had to compete in a devastated agricultural economy that struggled to rebuild itself from the war. Eventually, northern industrialists entered Southern markets, joining white Southern land barons to take advantage of cheap labor in industries including textiles, steel and mining. The trend continued as the regional economy expanded with chemical plants and oil refineries in Texas and Louisiana, shipbuilding along the coasts and, eventually, auto plants from Texas to the Carolinas. Generations of Southern elected officials -- Democrats and Republicans - perfected their pitch to outside firms. \"They always offered major tax breaks and basically sold people on moving their factories South by saying, look, we can offer you rock-bottom labor prices and labor laws that will always favor employers,\" said Merritt. Some observers say that history should temper expectations. \"The political power of business and corporate leaders and the anti-union power in the South are still quite strong,\" said Duke University emeritus professor Robert Korstad, an expert on Southern labor\u00b4s evolution. \"So, it\u00b4s not going to be anything easy.\" Amazon, which has a long record of beating back organizing campaigns, has held mandatory sessions to tell workers a union would command dues when they already get the kind of compensation benefits, including health insurance, that unions negotiate. \"We believe we already offer everything the unions are requesting and that we highly value direct communication with our employees,\" said company spokeswoman Heather Knox. Amazon offered a similar message to Democratic elected officials who joined Appelbaum on a recent visit. \"Members of Congress welcome to Bessemer,\" an electronic sign in the facility\u00b4s parking lot read. \"Please match Amazon\u00b4s $15/hour minimum wage.\" All House members there already had supported a $15 wage bill. The union organizers have a sign of their own in Bessemer - one that hints at the broader political possibilities beyond the campaign. Outside the Amazon warehouse is a banner depicting voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams - credited as an early architect of Biden\u00b4s win in Georgia - as a \"Rosie the Riveter\" character, an iconic symbol of workers\u00b4 power. \"We can do it,\" the banner reads.          An Amazon distribution center in Bessemer, Ala., on March 5, 2021, is the center of a potentially groundbreaking unionization effort. Almost 6,000 workers are currently voting by mail on whether to form a union that would give them collective bargaining rights with the online retail and entertainment giant. Company executives maintain that Amazon already offers the kind of pay and benefits packages that unions typically negotiate for their members.

Turner, 27, was a third-round draft pick by Carolina in the 2014 NFL Draft and was a Pro Bowl selection from 2015-19. The Panthers traded him to the Chargers last March for tackle Russell Okung. Turner was entering the final year of a four-year, $45 million contract extension he signed with Carolina in July 2017, and releasing him will save the Chargers about $11.5 million in salary cap money. In his only season in Los Angeles, knee and groin injuries limited Turner to only nine games. With the Panthers, he appeared in 16 games twice and 13 games in each of his other four seasons. The Chargers also released linebacker Malik Jefferson, who made five tackles on special teams in 13 games with the team in 2020. He finished the 2019 season on the Los Angeles practice squad. Jefferson, 24, has played in 34 games over the past three seasons, including stints with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2018 and Cleveland Browns in 2019. --Field Level Media",

        "title": "France have not lost momentum ahead of England clash - Ollivon",
        "full article": "By Julien Pretot PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - France captain Charles Ollivon is confident Les Bleus have not lost their momentum despite being hit by a COVID-19 outbreak as they prepare for a pivotal Six Nations clash against England at Twickenham on Saturday. Twelve players and five staff members, including head coach Fabien Galthie, tested positive for the novel coronavirus after France's second win in as many games when they beat Ireland, prompting organisers to postpone their match against Scotland. It means France have not played in the championship since Feb. 14, while England last played on Feb. 27 when they lost 40-24 to Wales - their second defeat in three outings. \"Honestly, nothing has changed. The atmosphere, the confidence, everything is intact,\" Ollivon told reporters on Friday. \"The momentum is still there and we cannot wait for tomorrow, to play this game and go on with our project. Things are very clear in our heads.\" France, who will host the next World Cup in 2023, have not won the Six Nations since 2010, the year they completed their last Grand Slam, and they have not beaten England at Twickenham in the championship since 2005. \"We know the challenge we're facing, England have won the last two competitions they were in,\" said Ollivon. England won the 2020 Six Nations, ahead of France on points difference despite losing to Les Bleus in Paris, and the Autumn Nations Cup by beating a largely reserve France side in the final. \"We know that whatever happens England will be ready, we know the task at hand,\" said Ollivon. France are second in the standings with nine points from two games, five behind Wales who have played three, with England in fourth place on six points from three matches. Les Bleus will rely on the same halfback pair of Antoine Dupont and Matthieu Jalibert that started against Italy and Ireland, and welcome back centre Virimi Vakatawa who missed the two opening games with a knee injury.

        "full article": "As more states consider legalising euthanasia, the nation's legislative trailblazer Victoria has reported more than 170 people ended their lives in 2020 with the help of the state's assisted dying scheme. The latest report from Victoria's Voluntary Assisted Dying Review Board confirmed 174 deaths under the scheme between January 1 and December 31 last year. The majority took the approved medication themselves, and 31 people had a dose administered by a medical practitioner. Since the state's voluntary assisted dying laws came into effect in June 2019, there have been 224 deaths. A total of 465 permit applications have been made in the past 18 months, with only 60 refused. A number of applications, however, were withdrawn because the applicant died before obtaining a permit. Only two people changed their mind. Under the laws, Victorian adults with an incurable and advanced terminal illness and less than six months to live - or 12 months for those with neurodegenerative conditions - are able to access a lethal substance They must also be of sound mind with decision-making capacity, make three clear requests to die and undergo two independent medical assessments. The request can only be initiated by the patients themselves. Medical professionals are able to conscientiously object. Tasmania is almost certain to become the third Australian jurisdiction to legalise voluntary assisted dying after the legislation passed the state's lower house earlier in March. Western Australia has passed laws, and the scheme is due to start in mid-2021. Of those people who have applied to use the scheme in Victoria, 77 per cent had terminal cancer and 23 per cent had a non-malignant diagnosis. Of the non-malignant diagnoses, 62 per cent had a neurodegenerative disease such as motor neurone disease and 38 per cent per cent had other untreatable diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, cardiomyopathy or chronic obstructive. Applicants have been aged between 20 and 100, with an average age of 71. About 52 per cent were men and 47 per cent were women, while one per cent selected \"self-described\" as their gender identity. Almost two-thirds lived in metropolitan areas with a third from regional or rural Victoria. There has been an overall compliance rate of 95 per cent, with just six cases referred for further investigation. None were related to eligibility. The chair of the Voluntary Assisted Dying Review Board, former Supreme Court judge Betty King, said 2020 had been a hard year for anyone who had lost a loved one. \"I appreciate the death of a loved one in such uncertain times may have been particularly difficult,\" she said in the report. \"The fact that voluntary assisted dying has been able to continue during this time is truly a testament to the work of many people and I wish to acknowledge their dedication.\" Ms King has called for the federal government to change its Criminal Code to allow doctors to consult with people seeking voluntary dying over the phone or via teleconference. In a statement to AAP, the Victorian government said its voluntary assisted dying laws \"are giving Victorians who are suffering an incurable illness a compassionate choice\". The government and Board \"has repeated its call for the Commonwealth to reconsider making an exemption from the Criminal Code to allow Victorians, especially those in regional Victoria, to be able to have important conversations about voluntary assisted dying over the phone or via teleconference\".

        "full article": "Organisers of a vigil for Sarah Everard are continuing talks with the Metropolitan Police to work out how the event could go ahead safely. Reclaim These Streets is planning to host the event in south London on Saturday near to where the 33-year-old, whose body was formally identified on Friday, went missing. The group brought urgent legal action at the High Court on Friday in a bid for a declaration that\u00a0any ban on outdoor gatherings under coronavirus regulations is \u201csubject to the right to protest\u201d. Mr Justice Holgate declined to grant the group\u2019s request and also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the force of \u201cprohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances\u201d is unlawful. The judge left it open for talks between the organisers and police to continue over the \u201capplication of the regulations and the (rights to freedom of expression and assembly)\u201d to the event, but said it would \u201cnot be appropriate\u201d for the court to make the declaration sought. In a statement after the ruling, Reclaim These Streets said: \u201cWe are working with (Lambeth) Council, who remain wholly supportive. \u201cWe call on the police to act within the law now and confirm that they will work with us to ensure that the protest can go ahead within the context of the overwhelming public response to Sarah Everard\u2019s death.\u201d In a tweet, they added: \u201cWe are now in discussions with the Met to confirm how the event can proceed in a way that is proportionate and safe \u2013 our number one priority.\u201d However, a statement from the Met urged people to \u201cstay at home or find a lawful and safer way to express your views\u201d. Commander Catherine Roper, the force\u2019s lead for community engagement, said: \u201cI understand this ruling will be a disappointment to those hoping to express their strength of feeling, but I ask women and allies across London to find a safe alternative way to express their views. \u201cThroughout the pandemic, we have consistently enforced the Covid regulations and have made difficult decisions during a range of gatherings on issues about which people have felt very strongly. \u201cOur hope has always been that people stick to the Covid rules, taking enforcement action is always a last resort. \u201cWe continue to speak with the organisers of the vigil in Clapham and other gatherings across London in light of this judgment and will explain the rules and urge people to stay at home.\u201d Reclaim These Streets was organised after the disappearance of Ms Everard prompted a public outcry about women\u2019s safety. The event was due to take place at Clapham Common bandstand at 6pm on Saturday. In his ruling, the judge said: \u201cGiven what has happened at the hearing, it may well be that there will be further communication between the claimants and the solicitors they instruct and the police to deal with the application of the regulations and (the rights to freedom of expression and assembly) to this particular event.\u201d However, he added: \u201cThat is not a matter upon which the court should comment.\u201d The judge concluded: \u201cI decline to grant the interim relief sought. But I hope that, in this judgment, I have clarified the application of the law in so far as it is appropriate for me to do so at this stage.\u201d Lawyers representing the organisers earlier argued the Met\u2019s interpretation of the Covid-19 restrictions goes against human rights law. Mr Hickman told the court a risk assessment had been carried out, adding: \u201cIt is proposed to organise it in a responsible manner, in co-ordination with the council and the police. \u201cArrangements will be made to ensure that it is conducted in a Covid-secure manner.\u201d The barrister said the measures would include compulsory mask wearing and social distancing, staggered arrival and departure times and marshals to oversee the event. Mr Hickman said in written submissions that police \u201creversed their position\u201d after initially appearing to support the vigil. He added that police told the organisers that \u201cthe vigil would be \u2018illegal\u2019 and that their \u2018hands are tied'\u201d by coronavirus restrictions. The barrister also said the claimants were told that, as organisers, they would be liable to be fined \u00a310,000, and potentially to be arrested, if they \u201cproceeded with their efforts to organise the vigil\u201d. George Thomas, representing the Met, said there is no \u201cblanket ban\u201d on protest as far as the force is concerned. He said: \u201cThe situation is that what is proposed here is a gathering of unlimited number and, given great and very understandable public concern and public interest in what has happened\u2026 it would not be at all surprising if the numbers were in the thousands.\u201d The barrister said this could lead to significant crowds in a central London location, at a time when Parliament\u2019s intention is to not allow gatherings of more than two people for health reasons amid the pandemic. He also told the court: \u201cNothing I have said today should in any way be understood by anyone hearing today\u2019s proceedings as the Metropolitan Police doing anything other than taking extremely seriously the concerns that the public, many members of the public, have expressed. \u201cThe Metropolitan Police share the anger that many members of the public have about what has happened. \u201cIt has every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show. \u201cBut, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place.\u201d In a tweet shortly after the ruling, Pippa Woodrow \u2013 one of the barristers representing the claimants \u2013 said: \u201cBall is now in the Met\u2019s court to confirm how the events can go ahead in a way that is proportionate and safe.\u201d Another barrister for the claimants, Adam Wagner, tweeted: \u201cAt 3pm today, every police force in England was saying protest could never be lawful under Covid regulations. \u201cThe position now, because of the ruling, is protest can in principle be lawful and it is up to the police to assess the proportionality.\u201d A Government spokesman said: \u201cAll of our thoughts are with Sarah\u2019s family and friends at this terrible time, and the Government recognises why so many women and girls across the country want to pay their respects. \u201cWe are still in the middle of a pandemic, which is why we urge people to do this safely and to continue to avoid mass gatherings. \u201cWe have also reopened our nationwide call for views on tackling violence against women and girls. So many have bravely shared their experiences over recent days and the Government is listening.\u201d",

        "full article": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Left-wing peace organizations on both side of Cyprus' ethnic divide have condemned the arrest in the breakaway north of four Turkish Cypriot activists for allegedly damaging signs that professed adoration for Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan. The Cyprus Peace Council umbrella group said in a statement Friday that the arrest of Sol Hareket movement members is part of an attempt to \"muzzle our Turkish Cypriot compatriots for their political beliefs.\" According to Turkish Cypriot media reports, four Sol Hareket members were charged with \"improper acts\" and \"colluding in secret,\" after the local youth wing of Turkey\u00b4s ruling AKP party filed a complaint to police about damage to signs reading in English: \"Love Erdogan.\" The signs reportedly sprung up in breakaway northern Cyprus after a \"Stop Erdogan\" sign appeared in New York\u00b4s Times Square. \"The brave resistance of those progressive movements that strive for Cyprus\u00b4 reunification against the political imposition of Ankara on the Turkish Cypriot community constitutes a message of hope,\" the Council said. Cyprus was cleaved along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup aimed at union with Greece. A Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island\u00b4s northern third is recognized only by Turkey, which keeps more than 35,000 troops there.

Sol Hareket leader Abdullah Korkmazhan was quoted as saying that neither he, nor any other group member was responsible for the damage, but said \"more power to those\" who did. \"We won\u00b4t be silenced,\" Korkmazhan said. \"The dictator who\u00b4s a burden to Turkey has become a burden to our own country and to the world. He\u00b4s losing his political power and that\u00b4s the reason for his aggressiveness.\"          A portrait of Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan and Turkish flags are seen on a building in the Turkish occupied area at the Turkish Cypriot breakaway north part of divided capital Nicosia, Cyprus, Wednesday, March 10, 2021.

        "full article": "By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO, March 12 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc is preparing to file for U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine later this month or early April after accumulating enough data to judge the inoculation's efficacy, sources with knowledge of the ongoing clinical trial told Reuters on Friday. The British drugmaker completed enrollment in its trial of more than 32,000 volunteers in January and now has data on at least 150 cases of COVID-19, two sources familiar with the trial told Reuters. The number of COVID-19 cases among those who got the vaccine versus infections in participants who received a placebo will show how effective the AstraZeneca shot was at preventing illness in those age 18 and over. The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in collaboration with Oxford University, has been authorized for use in the European Union and many countries but not yet by U.S. regulators. \"The U.S. Phase III study results are necessary for the FDA\u00b4s evaluation of an EUA request for our vaccine,\" a company spokeswoman said, without confirming trial details being reported by Reuters. \"We expect data from our U.S. Phase III trial to be available soon, in the coming weeks, and we plan to file for emergency use authorization shortly thereafter.\" Highly anticipated results from the U.S. trial could help settle safety concerns arising over reports of serious blood clots in some vaccine recipients that have led several nations to pause administering the vaccine. A World Health Organization expert advisory committee is looking into the matter. The data could also help determine what becomes of doses already sitting in U.S. warehouses awaiting approval. The New York Times reported on Thursday that some countries have been asking to procure doses of the vaccine not currently being offered in the United States. AstraZeneca said in February it expects its vaccine could receive U.S. emergency use authorization at the beginning of April and could immediately deliver 30 million doses to locations around the United States. In a Friday press briefing, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said the United States has a small inventory of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which it plans to keep and deploy to Americans should an EUA be granted. The U.S. stance could thwart AstraZeneca\u00b4s efforts to come closer to delivering on its contractual obligation with the EU of 180 million doses in the second quarter. AstraZeneca told the EU earlier this year it would cut its supplies in the second quarter by at least half to less than 90 million doses, EU sources told Reuters, after a bigger reduction in the first three months of the year.

Riverside County, where the course is located, remains under the strictest restrictions in the purple tier. Alyssa Randolph, the tournament manager, told the Desert Sun that officials will continue to monitor developments but no preparations are being made for fans. \"At the moment and given that Riverside County still remains in the purple tier, there is no change to our plans to play the 50th ANA without spectators,\" she wrote in an email to the newspaper. Under California rules, 100 fans now are allowed at an outdoor venue that is located in the purple tier. Tier levels are determined by rates of COVID-19 cases, and being listed in the next tier -- the red tier -- means a venue can have up to 20 percent capacity but cannot allow entry to anyone traveling from more than 120 miles away. The tournament, which is the first major of the season on the LPGA Tour, is scheduled to be played April 1-4. The ANA Inspiration was moved last year from April to September and played without fans in attendance. Mirim Lee of South Korea won the event in a three-way playoff. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "Bryson DeChambeau said he's lucky to be in contention heading into the weekend at The Players Championship after spraying the ball all over TPC Sawgrass in Friday's second round. DeChambeau shot his second consecutive 3-under 69 on Friday, but that doesn't tell the story of his round at Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. After a good warm-up session, DeChambeau promptly sent his opening tee shot on the 10th hole far right. The second shot failed to put him back in position and DeChambeau carded a double bogey to begin his round. \"Frustration, definitely,\" DeChambeau said of his feeling walking off the 10th hole. \"I wasn't feeling as comfortable as I should have been feeling, and unfortunately, that's the way my day started.\" DeChambeau continued to fight a wayward driver throughout the round, but managed to put the wheels back on with a trio of birdies to make his turn in 1-under 35. After five pars to open his back nine, DeChambeau birdied two of his final four holes to get in the clubhouse at 6 under halfway through the tournament. The score belies DeChambeau's struggles off the tee. He benefitted from several of his off-target drives winding up with clean lies and credited his short game with keeping the round together with multiple up-and-downs. DeChambeau has managed to hit only 43 percent of the fairways through 36 holes. \"I've been pretty lucky, for the most part,\" he said. \"I don't think that'll happen this weekend. I've got to make sure that my game is good off the tee, so I don't have those issues occurring and I don't have to rely on luck for the most part. \"I have to get it in the fairway.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) - The Buffalo Bills agreed to sign offensive lineman Daryl Williams to a three-year contract on Friday, days before the starter was eligible to become a free agent. Williams is a sixth-year player, who started all 16 games during his first season in Buffalo. He signed a one-year deal with the Bills a year ago after spending his first five seasons with the Carolina Panthers. Williams took over at right tackle with the Bills, in a move that allowed Cody Ford to switch to right guard. Williams was part of a Josh Allen-led offense that set numerous yards passing and scoring records en route to a 13-3 finish. Buffalo clinched its first AFC East title in 25 years and also made its deepest playoff run since the 1993 season. The Bills' season ended with a loss to Kansas City in the AFC championship game. Williams\u00b4 new deal was reached a day after the Bills re-signed linebacker Matt Milano to a four-year contract. Buffalo began the week with little room under the salary cap before freeing up more than $14.4 million in space by releasing receiver John Brown and defensive lineman Quinton Jefferson. The two re-signings have the potential of limiting the Bills from affording to retain pending free agents, offensive lineman Jon Feliciano and receiver Isaiah McKenzie. ___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

According to unidentified sources who spoke to Stadium, the Huskers contacted teams in the Mid-American Conference and Old Dominion about playing in Lincoln, Nebraska, on Sept. 18. The Lincoln Journal Star also reported Nebraska officials explored the feasibility of not playing the Sooners. The news created a firestorm among Cornhuskers fans, many of whom railed on social media about the Huskers being afraid to play the game against their old rival. Johnny Rodgers, the 1972 Heisman Trophy winner who starred in the '71 game, said, \"We can\u00b4t really afford to have a reputation like that, trying to get out of playing top teams.\" Nebraska athletic director Bill Moos said in a statement that the Huskers look forward to playing the Sooners. \"Due to the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to Husker Athletics and the local community, our administration did explore the possibility of adding an eighth home game this fall,\" Moos said. \"That option would have helped us mitigate cost-cutting measures and provide a much-needed boost to our local economy. Ultimately, the decision was made to move forward with our game at Oklahoma in 2021. We have the utmost respect for the University of Oklahoma, and this storied rivalry, and I know our fans have been excited about this series for a long time.

(Bob Gorham/Lincoln Journal Star via AP, File)  It would have cost Nebraska $1 million to break the contract, which was signed in 2012. The teams also are scheduled to meet in Lincoln in 2022. Prior to Moos' statement, Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione issued a statement saying the Sooners plan to play. \"The Oklahoma-Nebraska football series represents one of the most unique traditional rivalries in college football,\" Castiglione said. \"The planning for this game was intentional as we mark the 50th anniversary of the Game of the Century. We\u00b4ve been looking forward to celebrating these two storied programs and have collaborated on various aspects of what promises to be a special weekend.\" The Huskers and Sooners played 71 straight seasons as members of the Big Six and Big Eight. The game decided the Big Eight championship 31 times in 36 seasons. The teams moved to the Big 12 in 1996 and met twice every four years. Nebraska went to the Big Ten in 2011. Oklahoma leads the series 45-38-3, having won the teams\u00b4 last meeting 23-20 in the 2010 Big 12 championship game. No game was bigger than the one in `71. The Huskers won in Norman and went on to a second straight national title. It was the Sooners' only loss, and they were No. 2 in the final polls. Rodgers is one of the most identifiable figures from the game, returning a punt 72 yards for a touchdown for the signature play of his career. Rodgers said he has been invited to participate in events surrounding the game and that he had gotten calls Friday from former teammates who were disgruntled about the possibility of ducking a big game. Rodgers called that notion \"unheard of.\" \"We can\u00b4t be trying to get out of being competitive, because that\u00b4s our whole nature,\" Rodgers said. \"Our whole state bleeds Big Red football. We want to be known for playing the best and beating the best.\" Oklahoma has won six straight Big 12 championships and appeared in four of the last six College Football Playoff semifinals. Nebraska has had losing seasons four straight years and in five of the last six. It is 12-20 in three seasons under Scott Frost. \"If we're going to start getting our reputation back, we've got to start beating and playing the best,\" Rodgers said. That's just the only way. What are we going to play? Division II schools or something? We play Ohio State.

        "title": "FOREX-Dollar rises with Treasury yields as economic prospects rise",
        "full article": "By John McCrank NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The dollar rose on Friday following a fresh spike in Treasury yields as the prospect of economies emerging from year-long coronavirus lockdowns reignited inflation fears. Market participants have grown wary in recent weeks that massive fiscal stimulus and pent-up consumer demand could lead to a jump in inflation as expanding vaccination campaigns bring an end to lockdowns. Data on Friday showed U.S. producer prices (PPI) had their largest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years, though considerable slack in the labor market could make it harder for businesses to pass the higher costs on to consumers. The U.S. economy is set to get a massive shot in the arm after President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law on Thursday and urged U.S. states to make all adults eligible for a coronavirus vaccine by May 1. A selloff in Treasuries overnight continued into the U.S. session, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hitting a fresh one-year high of 1.6420%, helped by optimism around U.S. economic prospects. The dollar was up 0.25% at 91.668 against a basket of six major currencies, leaving it on track to end the week slightly lower. The greenback hit an intraday high of 92.506 when yields surged on Tuesday, which was its strongest since November, but recorded three straight days of losses as yields stabilized. \"Bond yields have been in a very strong uptrend and with the PPI numbers somewhat higher than consensus, that's contributing to the rise,\" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management. \"That's widely positive for the dollar, as the greenback has been taking its cues from yields and these new highs are really encouraging more demand for the greenback, especially at a time when you have the ECB accelerating bond purchases and being a little bit more dovish,\" she said. The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would increase the pace of its money printing to prevent a rise in euro zone bond yields in support of the economic recovery. Although the euro was down 0.3% at $1.19505, it was set for a small weekly gain. Traders will be looking to the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week for any comments about rising yields. They are also keen for any information on the upcoming expiry of the Fed's temporary easing of the \"supplementary leverage ratio\" (SLR), which seems to be part of the reason behind the sell-off in Treasuries, said Erik Bregar, director and head of FX strategy at the Exchange Bank of Canada. The SLR directs large banks to hold more capital against their assets. Last April, the Fed eased the rules by exempting certain investments, including Treasuries, from a key leverage calculation in an effort to improve market liquidity as the economy cratered due to coronavirus shutdowns. So far there has been no word from the Fed on a possible extension. \"Primary dealers are shedding bonds because this exemption might not get renewed at the end of March,\" Bregar said. Riskier currencies gave back some recent gains on Friday. The Australian dollar - which is seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - fell by 0.35% to 0.77595 versus the U.S. dollar . The New Zealand dollar was down 0.68% against the greenback at 0.7178. The Norwegian crown lost out to both the euro and dollar. Dollar-yen was up around 0.52%, changing hands at 109.050 , close to the 109.235 reached on Tuesday, which had been the yen's weakest since June 2020. Elsewhere, bitcoin dropped 1.1% to $57,150.97, having come close to, but not exceeded, its recent record high of $58,354.14 .

Australia's longest-serving finance minister will take over as secretary-general of the Paris-based organisation from outgoing Angel Gurria. \"There is much work to be done, global cooperation on economic social and environmental policies is more important than ever,\" Mr Cormann told reporters in Perth on Saturday. \"I can't wait to get stuck into it,\" he said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says it's the most senior appointment of an Australian candidate to an international body for decades, and a \"recognition of Australia's global agency\". Mr Cormann said he was honoured to be selected and would focus on promoting stronger, cleaner, fairer economic growth and raising employment and living standards following the coronavirus pandemic. He also promised that Australians would benefit from his appointment. \"Australia is a very successful trading economy, and what happens in the rest of the world matters to Australia,\" he said. Mr Cormann singled out climate change as a key challenge, saying he plans to pursue an ambitious and \"global\" approach to help countries become carbon-neutral by 2050. He also wants to finalise a multilateral approach to digital taxation, and strengthen the outreach of the OECD into the Asia-Pacific. \"This is a great honour for Mathias who has worked tirelessly over several months to engage with leaders, senior ministers and officials of OECD member nations from Europe, Asia and the Americas,\" Mr Morrison said in a statement on Saturday. \"Mathias' work and life experience in both Europe and Australia, his outstanding record as Finance Minister and Senate leader and his expertise in international economic diplomacy will ensure he makes an outstanding contribution as leader of the OECD.\" Mr Cormann thanked both sides of politics for supporting his candidacy. Labor's Tony Burke has welcomed the appointment, but remembered that the coalition had failed to support former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's bid to become the next secretary-general of the United Nations. \"Labor has had a very simple view that it's in Australia's interests to have Australians in significant international roles,\" Mr Burke told reporters in Sydney on Thursday. He agreed Mr Cormann has genuinely changed his position on climate change since his time in government. \"I expect that what he says on climate change now is what he believes, and I expect what he said when he was in government is not what he believed,\" Mr Burke said. Mr Cormann will begin his five-year term from June 1.",

        "title": "Whitmer offers plan to supply propane after pipeline closes",
        "full article": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) - Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration released a plan Friday to make sure Michigan will have enough propane if a controversial pipeline is shut down. The strategy addresses a frequent objection to the Democratic governor\u00b4s demand that Enbridge Inc. decommission its Line 5, a leading carrier of natural gas liquids that are refined into propane to heat many Michigan homes. It calls for more state investment in rail and propane storage infrastructure and pledges efforts to find new suppliers while working with the industry to deal with potential shortages. It proposes more energy efficiency and greater use of other sources, including renewables. \"Governor Whitmer has remained committed to ensuring the state\u00b4s energy needs are met when the Enbridge oil pipelines shut down, and this plan furthers that commitment while protecting consumers and their pocketbooks,\" spokeswoman Chelsea Lewis-Parisio said. Enbridge dismissed the proposals as \"wholly inadequate for replacing the propane or energy supply Michiganders currently depend on,\" adding that it would worsen pollution by requiring greater use of other transport methods that would increase customer costs. Line 5 carries oil and gas liquids through northern Wisconsin, Michigan's Upper Peninsula and a portion of the northern Lower Peninsula. A 4 mile (6.4 kilometer) section divides into two pipes that cross the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, which connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.          FILE - This June 2020, file photo, shot from a television screen provided by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy shows damage to anchor support EP-17-1 on the east leg of the Enbridge Line 5 pipeline within the Straits of Mackinac, Mich. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration released a plan Friday, March 12. 2021, to provide adequate supplies of propane in Michigan if a controversial pipeline is shut down. The strategy addresses a frequent objection to the Democratic governor's demand that Enbridge Inc. decommission its Line 5, a leading carrier of natural gas liquids used in the propane that heats many Michigan homes. (Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy via AP, File)  Whitmer ordered the company last fall to close the 645 mile (1,038 kilometer) line by May, siding with environmental and tribal groups who say it's vulnerable to a rupture that could devastate the lakes. Enbridge, which is fighting the governor's order in court, says the 68-year-old line is in good condition but that it wants to swap the underwater segment for a new pipe that would be housed in a tunnel beneath the lake bottom. The company has received state environmental permits for the project and is seeking others. Enbridge says Line 5 fulfills 65% of propane demand in the Upper Peninsula and 55% statewide. For Love of Water, an environmental group, says those numbers are inflated and that a few truckloads or rail cars per day could replace what the pipeline supplies to the U.P. Whitmer's strategy was based on an assessment of statewide energy needs by the Michigan Public Service Commission, as well as a 2020 report from a U.P. energy task force and recommendations of state departments looking for propane sources other than Line 5. Retailers have begun developing arrangements less dependent on Line 5, some utilizing state grants for rail facilities, the plan says. Whitmer's 2022 budget proposal includes $10 million to support rail transport of propane in the U.P. and $5 million for storage tanks near rail spurs. The state is exploring other steps such as injecting more propane into storage reservoirs and encouraging pre-buying to lock in supplies for residents and businesses. The plan also includes heating assistance for needy families and protections against price gouging. \"For years, Enbridge and their allies have been spending millions of dollars to scare Michigan residents and create a fiction that the sky will fall and people will freeze without Line 5,\" said Sean McBrearty of Clean Water Action. \"Governor Whitmer\u00b4s team has proved them wrong once again. When Line 5 is shut down, our Great Lakes will no longer be at risk of a massive oil spill, and Michigan will still have all the energy resources we need.\" Mark Griffin, president of the Michigan Petroleum Association, said the group was studying Whitmer's plan but remained opposed to closing Line 5. U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, a Republican whose district covers northern Michigan, said the plan would leave Upper Peninsula residents \"out in the cold and is incredibly tone deaf to the needs of our constituents.\"",

You can expect further announcements on that in weeks, not months,\" said the official, who declined to be named, in a telephone briefing with reporters. The operation, which was identified in December and which the U.S. government has said was likely orchestrated by Russia, breached software made by SolarWinds Corp, giving hackers access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products. Microsoft President Brad Smith described the attack as \"the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.\" The senior official also noted that most of the nine federal government agencies compromised by the SolarWinds hack have completed an independent review and those that have not will finish one by the end of March. The hacking, which also hurt 100 private companies, used corrupted SolarWinds code and weaknesses in Microsoft identity-management tools.

        "full article": "By Brendan O'Brien March 12 (Reuters) - A massive spring snowstorm was approaching the U.S. Rockies and High Plains on Friday, threatening the region this weekend with blizzard-like conditions, heavy snowfalls and fierce wind gusts that could paralyze travel and cause avalanches. The storm could dump up to 2 feet (61 cm) of snow and offer winds of up to 35 miles per hour (56 km per hour) to the I-25 Urban Corridor along the Southern Rocky Mountains in much of Colorado and Wyoming through the weekend, the National Weather Service said. \"March is one of our snowiest months of the year when we can get storms ... like this that have a ton of moisture to work with,\" Colorado-based weather service meteorologist Zach Hiris said. \"It's certainly unusual but not earth-shattering snowfall totals.\" The weather service forecast as much as 4 feet (1.22 m) of snow could fall in higher elevations, warning of possible avalanches in remote areas of Colorado and Wyoming where snow could rapidly accumulate. Travel could become impossible with blowing and drifting snow across roadways, the service said, as Colorado Department of Transportation urged motorists to stay off the roads. Colorado Governor Jared Polis said he activated the state's National Guard to respond to search and rescue requests over the weekend. \"I urge you to stay home if it's going to snow hard in your area so you don\u00b4t need them to rescue you,\" he said in a tweet. The Denver International Airport, where 18 inches (45.72 cm) of snow were in the forecast, told passengers to check with their airlines, many of which were offering travel waivers for flights scheduled over the weekend. The storm was also expected to bring a mix of rain and snow and winds of up to 45 mph to parts of western Nebraska. (Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "full article": "PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - Australia's former finance minister Mathias Cormann on Friday announced he won the race to lead the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), disappointing climate activists who said he has blocked efforts to reduce emissions. Cormann takes over as the OECD enters the final stretch of one of its highest profile missions: steering global talks to rewrite rules for taxing cross border commerce for the first time in a generation. Cormann won a tight race, narrowly beating the Swedish politician and former European Union trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, who went into the final vote with broad support from most European countries. \"Earlier today I learned that the Selection Committee will recommend to the OECD Council that I be appointed as next Secretary-General of the OECD,\" Cormann said in a statement. He said the OECD would stay focused on maximising the strength of the economic recovery from COVID-19, to promote ambitious action on climate change and work on finalising a multilateral approach to digital taxation. Born in Belgium before migrating to Australia in 1996, Cormann has said the OECD must provide leadership on climate change, adding that the targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement were a foundation to build upon. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the election of Cormann demonstrated Canberra's global standing. \"This is a great honour for Mathias who has worked tirelessly over several months to engage with leaders, senior ministers and officials of OECD member nations from Europe, Asia and the Americas,\" Morrison said in an emailed statement. Environmental activists expressed bitter disappointment at his victory. Last week, campaign groups sent a letter to OECD noting that as Australia's finance minister, Cormann abolished the country\u00b4s carbon pricing scheme, failed to commit to a net-zero emissions target, and maintained fossil fuel subsidies. At that time, the Australian government \"persistently failed to take effective action to reduce emissions at home and has consistently acted as a blocker within international forums\". \"We have little confidence in Cormann\u00b4s ability to ensure the OECD is a leader in tackling the climate crisis, when he has an atrocious record on the issue,\" Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said.

        "title": "New York's two senators join mounting calls for Governor Cuomo to resign",
        "full article": "By Gabriella Borter and Joseph Ax March 12 (Reuters) - New York's two U.S. senators joined other leading Democrats in urging New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign on Friday after a seventh woman came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, and Kirsten Gillibrand, a leading voice of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse, joined others including U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in calling on the three-term Democratic governor to resign. Cuomo, 63, the divorced father of three daughters in their 20s, again repeated his denial of the allegations on Friday and said it was \"reckless and dangerous\" for politicians to ask him to resign before they have all the facts. \"Women have a right to come forward and be heard, and I encourage that fully. But I also want to be clear: there is still a question of the truth. I did not do what has been alleged, period,\" Cuomo said on a call with reporters. \"Wait for the facts. An opinion without facts is irresponsible,\" he said. Asked on Friday if he ever had consensual romantic relationships with any of the women, Cuomo responded by saying only that he never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable, and was sorry if he did. Hours after the governor's call with reporters, Schumer and Gillibrand became the highest-profile national politicians to urge him to resign. \"Due to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York,\" the two senators said in a joint statement. A growing list of women including former aides have accused the governor of sexual misconduct, ranging from unwelcome flirtatious behavior at work to groping. Reporter Jessica Bakeman became the latest on Friday, writing a first-person account for New York magazine. She said Cuomo had often put his hands on her, including one time when taking a picture with her at a 2014 holiday party when she said he remarked, \"I'm sorry. Am I making you uncomfortable? I thought we were going steady.\" Bakeman said she did not want to smile for the camera with Cuomo's hands on her, but decided it was easier to take a quick picture than challenge a powerful politician. \"I never thought the governor wanted to have sex with me. It wasn't about sex. It was about power,\" she wrote. \"He wanted me to know that he could take my dignity away at any moment with an inappropriate comment or a hand on my waist.\" The new calls for Cuomo to resign came a day after more than 55 Democratic New York state lawmakers urged him to step down, and the state legislature said it would open an impeachment investigation into the allegations. The legislative inquiry will run parallel to an investigation led by the office of New York State Attorney General Letitia James. The two senators joined at least 16 of the 27 members of New York's U.S. congressional delegation in urging Cuomo to quit, calling into question the political future of the high profile Democratic figure, who gained national prominence for his leadership during the peak of his state's COVID-19 crisis. While 15 U.S. House members from New York issued their statements on Friday, a House aide told Reuters there was no formal, coordinated effort within the delegation to pressure Cuomo. On Tuesday, an unnamed aide told the Times Union that Cuomo had groped her after calling her to the executive mansion under the pretext of business last year, long after the #MeToo movement took down a host of politicians, media figures and business leaders for sexual harassment or assault. \"The fact that this latest report was so recent is alarming, and it raises concerns about the present safety and well-being of the administration's staff,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a joint statement on Friday with U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday that President Joe Biden \"certainly supports\" the state attorney general's investigation into the allegations. She added that the president and his COVID-19 response team would continue working with Cuomo on vaccination roll-out in New York.

        "full article": "Sebastian Langkamp is still a \"while off\" from making his A-League debut, with Perth Glory coach Richard Garcia to take a cautious approach with the former Bundesliga defender . Langkamp completed his two-week quarantine period last month, but any hopes of a swift Glory call-up have been quashed by a recent wrist injury at training. Garcia says he will play it safe with the 33-year-old ex-Germany under-21 star, with the club yet to put an exact timeline on his return. \"He's still a while off,\" Garcia said. \"It's a hard one, because we're eager to put him back in (for team training), but how early do we put him back in without risking him getting injured? \"The guy's been in Europe, where he hadn't played a lot of football after Christmas. \"So he hasn't done a lot of football stuff for three or four months. \"We've got to be wary of that. We could risk him and have him for one game and then he breaks down, or we could do the right thing and wait until he's ready and have him for the remainder of the season.\" Glory will be aiming to end a two-match losing run when they take on the ladder-leading Mariners at Central Coast Stadium on Sunday. Perth dominated possession in losses to Central Coast (2-1) and Wellington (3-0), but they were caught napping on the counter attack and at set-pieces. Garcia is urging his team to stay switched on. \"It's been simple errors from defending when we've dominated the game,\" Garcia said. \"Teams are really backing off, getting people behind the ball and sitting off. That's something we have to deal with and try and break down. \"But we also have to be fully focused on the counter-attack, and when we are going forward, that our defensive mindset is just as important. \"We had such a good start with so many goals that people are going to be wary of what we're capable of, set up shop and try and catch us on the counter.\" The Mariners entered the round with a whopping seven-point lead at the top of the ladder, with their most recent result a 2-0 victory over Macarthur on Monday. STATS THAT MATTER * Glory defender Darryl Lachman has a passing accuracy of 97 per cent from his 213 passes in the centre third of the pitch this season. It is the highest of any player who has made at least 100 passes. * Central Coast have scored the opening goal of the game on seven occasions this season, the most of any team. They have gone on to win six of those matches. * The Mariners have won their past three home games. The last time they won more in succession was a five-game stretch from March to October 2014.",

At the end of March a NSW coroner is due to investigate the death of Braydon Worldon, killed on his 15th birthday in December 2019. A passing motorist found Braydon's body in the middle of River Road at the small township of Wantabadgery, about 40km from Wagga Wagga. Due to his injuries, police believe the vehicle that hit him was medium to large in size and fitted with a bull bar. There is no evidence the vehicle braked. The driver has never been found. \"There would be no reason why you would not see someone on the roadway,\" Detective Senior Constable Stan Wall said this week. The veteran detective was on the scene the night Braydon was found. \"It's a quiet, isolated piece of roadway, it was quite moonlit, there was no fog around, the road was clear,\" he said. \"A motorist was travelling home from night shift along the road and he came across Braydon's body.\" It's possible Braydon had been lying dead for hours, given the low traffic numbers on the road. Braydon lived nearby with his family, was often walking the hills and fishing in local waterways. \"He was celebrating his 15th birthday, did a little bit of stock work with his stepfather and ... had a couple of drinks ... his movements after that aren't really well known, except he's located at one o'clock in the morning, 2km from his house, on the road,\" Det Sen Const Wall said. He was last seen about 7.30pm.",

        "full article": "A roundup of some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. None of these are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. The Associated Press checked them out. Here are the facts: ___ House members were not given bonuses in $1.9T COVID bill CLAIM: The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awards a $25 million bonus to members of the House of Representatives. THE FACTS: The \"American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,\" as the bill is titled, contains no allocation for bonuses or raises for House or Senate members. A Facebook post that circulated around the approval of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill Wednesday promoted the false information, stating: \"Did you know? Line 17 of the $1.9 TRILLION CV #Stimulus awards a $25 MILLION BONUS to House Reps?\" It is not clear what \"Line 17\" means in the post since there\u00b4s a line 17 on nearly every page of the 628-page bill. There are several passages that cite $25 million in funding, but no mention of congressional pay raises or bonuses. The sweeping package, approved by a 220-211 party-line vote, would give most Americans $1,400 checks and billions of dollars would be directed to schools, state and local governments and businesses. \"That claim is false. In fact, there is no funding for the House of Representatives or Senate in the bill at all,\" Evan Hollander, communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, confirmed to The Associated Press in an email. The AP knocked down a similar false claim in March 2020 when a $2.2 trillion rescue package was passed. - Associated Press writer Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed this report.

Scott Applewhite)  ___ Social media posts misrepresent bill expanding background checks for firearms CLAIM: Proposed federal gun legislation expanding background checks for firearms would create a \"national registration of firearms\" and put gun owners in jail for transferring or handing their gun to someone, even if they are in a dangerous situation. THE FACTS: The bill, HR 8, prohibits using the legislation to establish a national firearms registry and includes exceptions that allow temporary transfers of firearms between family members, transfers between people for self-defense and for use at a shooting range. The bill, requiring background checks on all gun sales, passed the House this week after stalling in the Senate about two years ago. Democratic Rep. Mike Thompson of California, who chairs the congressional task force on gun violence prevention, is the primary sponsor of the bill. Advocates say the legislation is intended to curb gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of people who are barred from owning firearms. Background checks are in place preventing people with criminal records from purchasing a firearm, but there are loopholes where people can buy guns through private sales, often called a \"gun show loophole,\" said Jake Charles, executive director at the Center for Firearms Law at the Duke University School of Law. Multiple social media posts described the legislation inaccurately, calling it a gun registration bill. Charles said that description is \"completely false.\" Not only does federal law prohibit a national gun registry, the bill clearly states: \"Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed to authorize the establishment, directly or indirectly, of a national firearms registry.\" One false Facebook post claims: \"If enforced to the letter, H.R. 8 could put millions of gun owners in prison by outlawing the transfer of any firearm without a proper Brady Check. The term `transfer\u00b4 is nowhere defined, but it\u00b4s clear from the bill that handing your gun to a neighbor for as little as even one second counts as a `transfer.' The bill claims to offer some so-called `exceptions,\u00b4\" the post continues, \"but these will be practically useless to gun owners. For example, if you hand (or `transfer\u00b4) a firearm to a friend because you hear a noise in your house in the middle of the night -- and it turns out to be a false alarm -- you\u00b4re a criminal. Under H.R. 8, since every gun transfer will go through a dealer, every gun owner will have a 4473, setting the stage for a national gun registry.\" Alex Macfarlane, a spokesperson for Thompson, said several issues raised in the post were incorrect. \"H.R. 8 does NOT require background checks to be conducted when a firearm is transferred to a family member,\" Macfarlane said in an email. \"The bill also includes a number of exemptions that would allow the temporary transfer of a gun under a variety of circumstances and purposes including: preventing imminent death or great bodily harm, or activities like hunting, going to a shooting range, or while in the presence of the gun owner.\" - Arijeta Lajka ___ Posts misrepresent CDC study on mask mandates CLAIM: A new study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that mask mandates have a negligible impact on coronavirus numbers. AP\u00b4S ASSESSMENT: The study found that mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates. Social media users and conservative websites this week shared a recent report from the CDC with false claims that it shows mask mandates don\u00b4t stem the spread of the coronavirus. \"Here is your proof from the CDC itself that masks don\u00b4t work,\" one Facebook user wrote. \"Study released on Friday says masks resulted in only 1-2% spread reduction over 100 days. Basically useless.\" The conservative television network One America News reported that the study showed masks have \"negligible impact\" and mask mandates \"do not make any statistical difference.\" Those claims distort the findings, according to CDC scientist Gery Guy Jr., the study's lead author. While the changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates in the report may seem small, they were statistically significant, he said. The CDC researchers examined U.S. counties placed under state-issued mask mandates, looking at data from March through December of last year. They found that within the first 20 days of implementation, mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease in daily COVID-19 case growth rates. As time went on, reductions in growth rates increased to nearly 2 percentage points. Those changes in daily growth rates may sound small, but their magnitude adds up quickly, Guy said. \"Each day that growth rate is going down, the cumulative effect - in terms of cases and deaths - adds up to be quite substantial,\" Guy told the AP in a previous report. Several social media posts also claimed that the results of the study were \"inside the margin for statistical error\" and therefore not significant. That\u00b4s false, according to Guy. He said those social media users may have misunderstood a sentence in the study that read, \"Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.\" The sentence refers to the period before mask mandates were implemented, not after. Guy said the research team examined this period to help rule out that there was not already a trend in place before mask mandates began. - Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in Seattle contributed this report. ___ Apes in San Diego received COVID-19 animal vaccine, not human doses CLAIM: Great apes at the San Diego Zoo are taking doses of the coronavirus vaccine that could have been used for veterans and senior citizens. THE FACTS: The apes received an experimental animal vaccine and did not take any doses meant for humans. As the United States attempts to inoculate its population against the coronavirus as quickly as possible, social media users are falsely claiming the government prioritized apes over humans for coveted vaccine doses. \"Great Apes in San Diego are getting the China Virus vaccine while veterans and senior citizens who want it aren\u00b4t,\" wrote Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, in a Friday tweet. \"Is this what Joe Biden means when he says he has a `plan\u00b4 to manage vaccine rollout?\" However, while many Americans who are eligible for a coronavirus vaccine are still waiting to get one amid delays and confusing requirements, no immunization that could have gone to humans went to a gorilla at the zoo. After a COVID-19 outbreak at the San Diego Zoo infected eight gorillas in January, zoo officials used an experimental animal vaccine to inoculate four orangutans and five bonobos. Three bonobos and a gorilla also were expected to receive the vaccine, which is experimental. The vaccine was developed by Zoetis Inc., a U.S. firm that produces medicine for animals. - Ali Swenson ___ Article makes false claims about mRNA vaccines and cancer CLAIM: A study by scientists at Sloan Kettering discovered Messenger RNA inactivates tumor suppressing proteins, meaning that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines can cause cancer. THE FACTS: The 2018 study has no relevance to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center confirmed the claim is false and misrepresents the findings of the study. An article in Natural News, which is known for circulating false information about vaccines, is spreading the false claim that COVID-19 vaccines could cause cancer. The claim that vaccines contain cancer causing ingredients has long been pushed by vaccine opponents. The story misrepresents a 2018 study to make the false assertion that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are \"cancer-driving inoculations that, once the series is complete, will cause cancer tumors in the vaccinated masses who have all rushed out to get the jab out of fear and propaganda influence.\" The false information was picked up by anti-vaccine websites and shared on Facebook and Reddit. \"Looks like the \"vaccine\" is going to give people cancer according to Scientists at Sloan Kettering,\" one Reddit user wrote when sharing the article. But the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which conducted the 2018 study, said there is no truth to the claim. \"This article circulating is categorically false, misrepresents the findings of our study and draws incorrect conclusions about vaccine risks,\" the institute said in a statement. According to the institute, the 2018 study found that changes in certain mRNA molecules can inactivate tumor-suppressing proteins and thereby promote cancer -- but there is no connection to the mRNA used in COVID-19 vaccines. \"It\u00b4s important to note that mRNAs are a normal component of all cells and the specific ones discussed here are not involved in mRNA-based vaccines, like the one developed against SARS-CoV-2,\" the institute\u00b4s statement said. Natural News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. - Associated Press writer Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed this report. ___ Maricopa County ballots are secured in a vault, not shredded in trash CLAIM: Shredded ballots found in a Maricopa County dumpster ahead of a Senate audit appear to be votes from the 2020 election. THE FACTS: Social media users are falsely suggesting ballots that Arizona state senators asked to audit were shredded in a Maricopa County Elections Department dumpster. The claim follows a legal battle between the state\u00b4s Republican-controlled Senate and the Republican-dominated Maricopa County board of supervisors over whether the Senate could access the county\u00b4s 2.1 million ballots and election equipment to directly audit the Nov. 3 election results. Last month, a judge ruled the Senate\u00b4s subpoena to access the ballots was valid. After winning the ruling, lawyers for the Senate asked that the ballots remain in the county\u00b4s possession since the Senate did not have a space for them. On March 6, Staci Burk, an Arizona woman who had previously filed an unsuccessful legal challenge to the election, posted photos of a man searching through a dumpster and a yellow plastic bag stuffed with shredded paper inside the dumpster. She also posted photos that showed the materials at a residence, and shredded papers with candidate names from the 2020 election. \"Ballots shredded and in dumpsters behind the Maricopa County Ballot tabulation center. Physical evidence collected,\" Burk posted on Facebook. Burk did not return a request for comment. The conservative site Gateway Pundit picked up the claim, suggesting that someone had attempted to shred ballots before the Senate could audit them. \"BALLOTS IN ARIZONA COUNTY FOUND SHREDDED IN DUMPSTER, DAYS BEFORE SENATE AUDIT,\" said one popular Facebook post. But county election officials say ballots from the election are securely preserved. Megan Gilbertson, the communications director for Maricopa County Elections Department, told The Associated Press that her office readied 2.1 million ballots to transfer to Senate custody and those ballots are still sealed and stored in the county\u00b4s vault that is monitored by a surveillance camera. \"Maricopa County has not, and would never destroy voted ballots until legally authorized to do so after the 24-month retention period,\" Gilbertson told the AP in a statement. \"None of the ballots or other General election materials from the vault were in the garbage, and as a matter of business, the county can and does throw out trash.\" Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, told the AP in a statement: \"I can say with 100% certainty that the 2.1 million legally voted ballots from the November General Election are safe and accounted for in the Elections Department vault, under 24/7 surveillance.\" Richer said his office shreds a variety of non-classified documents, as well as \"deceased voter ballots since they could never be legally tabulated.\" Those ballots were turned in by the relatives of people who died and were shredded if they were not signed before the voter's death. Gilbertson confirmed to the AP that the Election Department preserves all ballots that were part of the official canvass, including those that were ultimately disqualified. - Associated Press writer Jude Joffe-Block in Phoenix contributed this report. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck ___ Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck          FILE - In this Friday, Feb. 19, 2021 file photo, rifles are displayed in a gun shop in Salem, Ore.

        "full article": "WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The United States and Iran have begun indirect diplomacy with Europeans and others conveying messages about how they might resume compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday. \"Diplomacy with Iran is ongoing, just not in a direct fashion at the moment,\" he told reporters. \"There are communications through the Europeans and through others that enable us to explain to the Iranians what our position is with respect to the compliance for compliance approach and to hear what their position is,\" Sullivan added. The new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has rejected giving Tehran unilateral incentives to begin talks but has held out the possibility of both sides taking reciprocal steps to resume implementing the deal, an approach Washington calls \"compliance for compliance.\" \"We are waiting at this point to hear further from the Iranians how they would like to proceed,\" Sullivan said. \"This is not going to be easy but we believe that we are in a diplomatic process now that we can move forward on and ultimately secure our objective, which is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and to do so through diplomacy.\" The United States on Feb. 18 said it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations resuming compliance with the pact that aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, seeking to revive a deal that Washington itself abandoned in 2018. Iran began violating the deal in 2019, about a year after former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from it and reimposed economic sanctions. Tehran has accelerated its breaches in recent months. Each side has insisted the other go first in returning to the deal, with Tehran demanding Washington remove its economic sanctions and the United States demanding that Iran reinstate limitations on its nuclear program.

        "title": "Flyers, Capitals meet as they head in different directions",
        "full article": "The struggling Philadelphia Flyers will attempt to avoid their fourth loss in five games when they host the Washington Capitals on Saturday. The Flyers fell 5-3 to the Capitals on Thursday, their second loss to them in the past week. To halt this trend, they'll need to minimize defensive miscues and then capitalize on the power play. This recent losing skid has dropped the Flyers out of a playoff spot, at least temporarily. \"There's no doubt we have to be better,\" Flyers head coach Alain Vigneault said. \"That's on me to have them prepared and know what to expect. We need to do a better job next game and players have to get themselves ready to execute and compete.\" Seven costly turnovers in the first period put the Flyers in a 2-1 hole and they never recovered. After a strong start this season, they're suddenly vying for points to work their way back into the playoff race. \"We all know in the locker room what we need to do as a team and individually better,\" said Travis Konecny, who had one goal and one assist in the loss. \"We need to focus on winning games and not on anybody else.\" One player who could provide assistance on defense is Phil Myers. He was a surprising healthy scratch on Thursday and the absence was noticeable. \"There are things we've talked about with him too often,\" Vigneault said of Myers. \"One, being first on the puck, taking a hit to make a play. He needs to improve in that area. It's cost us in the last few games in some situations. Next time he comes in the lineup, he's got to find a way to play the right way and stay in the lineup.\" The surging Capitals will be searching for their fourth straight win. Alex Ovechkin scored his 715th career goal and came within two goals of tying Phil Esposito for sixth all-time on the career goals list on Thursday. Ovechkin has been stellar against the Flyers through his career with 38 goals in 60 games. John Carlson added one goal for his 500th career point. Statistics aside, the goal helped to provide two more crucial points. \"I certainly know it's important for a season like this to string some good games together and get some really good points down the stretch,\" Carlson said. \"Those are always nice. It can really make up for a little dry spell here or there, but certainly this year with the shortened season, it's great. With that said, everything's so close, so the onus is on us to keep moving and keep collecting as many as we can.\" As the wins pile up, especially on the road against a heated rival, the team will continue to gain confidence. \"I think fighting and clawing for ways to win is good, building some character,\" Carlson said. \"Obviously we would like to win 10-0 every night, but being in different situations and coming out on top is I think nice, to do it in certain ways so you can kind of put it in your back pocket and draw on it when you need it.\" The Capitals also received a major boost from goaltender Ilya Samsonov, who made 30 saves and added an assist on Nic Dowd's empty net goal. He's 3-0-0 since returning from a bout with COVID-19. \"It's really hard recovery after COVID,\" Samsonov said. \"I have a problem with the breathing, so hard. You got some 40 minutes practice, you feel so tired and hard breathing. But right now, I feel more and more better every day.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "Shopping on the NFL free agent market can be so very tempting. Talented and experienced linemen, pass rushers, wide receivers and cornerbacks available to fill a hole in the roster. That new starter can be yours with a big enough check. Just be sure to add enough zeros. Being available in free agency does not guarantee sure-fire production. Just ask the Tennessee Titans. The Titans need only think back a few months to remember the need to spend smartly after busting on not one but two free agents. They shelled out more than $21 million combined on Vic Beasley and Jadeveon Clowney. Signed to boost a struggling pass rush, Tennessee cut Beasley after three tackles in five games while Clowney went on injured reserve after eight.          FILE- In this Sept. 9, 2020, file photo, Tennessee Titans outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney and outside linebacker Vic Beasley Jr. (44) warm up during an NFL football practice in Nashville. Being available in free agency does not guarantee sure-fire production. The Titans need only think back a few months to remember the need to spend smartly after busting on not one but two different free agents. They shelled out more than $21 million combined on Vic Beasley and Jadeveon Clowney. (George Walker IV/The Tennessean via AP, Pool, File)  Not a single sack combined between the two. \"It\u00b4s important that this offseason that we learn, that I learn personally from last year, that we try to improve,\" Titans general manager Jon Robinson said. Busting on free agents doesn't stop any NFL team from trying again. \"We\u00b4re looking for those kinds of players, willing to invest resources,\" Robinson said. For every Tom Brady signed, there's plenty of busts every free agency period. Someone who simply doesn't meet the expectations that come along with his big paycheck or proves a bad fit with the new team. And the bigger checks of free agency make those mistakes even more costly. CAM NEWTON Brady celebrated his first season with his new team with the Lombardi Trophy in Tampa Bay. Newton tried to replace Brady in New England in a season where the coronavirus pandemic not only slowed his development in the offense but also cost him two weeks with COVID-19 early in the season. Newton struggled in the passing game much of the season with little help. Julian Edelman was never fully healthy before going on injured reserve. Newton wound up one-dimensional and couldn't cover all the Patriots' holes. That didn't stop the Patriots from working to keep Newton on another one-year deal. TRADE BUSTS Sometimes the busts aren\u00b4t free agents but trade acquisitions, which can be even worse. The Denver Broncos recently jettisoned Jurrell Casey and A.J. Bouye, two veterans they traded for a year ago only to see the deals quickly blow up in their faces. The Broncos thought they had a steal when they sent a seventh-rounder to Tennessee for Casey, but the five-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman tore a biceps in Week 3, ending his season. Denver sent a fourth-round pick to Jacksonville for Bouye, but he played in just seven games because of shoulder and head injuries and a suspension for violating the NFL\u00b4s policy on performance-enhancers. The Broncos cut both last month, freeing up about $24 million in salary cap room. CORY LITTLETON The Raiders thought they were getting a difference-maker when they signed linebacker Cory Littleton to a three-year, $35.25 million deal. He never came close to that in 14 games played last season. He didn't have a single sack, force a fumble or recover a fumble. Raiders coach Jon Gruden pegged defensive tackle Maliek Collins as a defensive key, yet Collins also finished without a sack or tackle for loss. But Las Vegas only signed Collins to a one-year deal for $6 million limiting the bust factor. BRESHAD PERRIMAN The Jets tried to protect themselves giving the wide receiver a one-year deal worth $8 million to prove himself as a replacement for Robby Anderson who took a two-year deal with Carolina worth up to $20 million. Perriman wound up with dealing with injuries including a hamstring, sprained ankle, a concussion and a shoulder. Combined with a struggling offense that rarely attacked downfield, Perriman was both ineffective with his new team and used inadequately. STEPHEN WEATHERLY Weatherly was a major bust for the Carolina Panthers after the defensive end signed a two-year, $12 million deal last offseason. Weatherly didn't get a single sack in nine games and had only one tackle for loss with three total hits on a quarterback. The Panthers cut their losses in February, releasing Weatherly to clear some salary cap space. Weatherly returned to the team that drafted him in Minnesota but at a much cheaper deal: one year for $2.5 million. ___ AP Pro Football Writers Arnie Stapleton, Josh Dubow and Dennis Waszak and AP Sports Writers Steve Reed and Kyle Hightower contributed to this report. ___ Follow Teresa M.

He scored both goals in a 2-0 win, finishing the match on the bench with a huge bag of ice pressed against his right knee.\u2018He had a little knock the day before,\u2019 said Mourinho, clearing up the pre-Palace mystery.\u2018We have everybody fit. We don\u2019t want to risk players. We want a 100-per-cent guarantee that playing wouldn\u2019t affect the near future. We did a little test to make sure he was right and he was. With me, players make these decisions. I trust the player more than anything.\u2019Kane wants to play every single minute of every single game. His dedication and desire are never in question.         The north Londoners' strong run of results has coincided with Kane's return from injury         The England captain has scored four goals in two games this week in a duo of strong showings         Mourinho, of course, wants him to play. Not only as a source of goals but as an example to those who might not share his appetite to go through pain barriers, suffer in pursuit of the dream, to endure poor patches of form until the goals flow again.\u2018I have been lucky enough to work with players with great ambitions,\u2019 said the Spurs boss. \u2018It is not possible to have a career like mine without players with ambition. He has that. No doubt he wants to win matches, score goals and win trophies.\u2019 At 27, Kane has matured from a pure goal machine into a creative role likened by his boss to one played so successfully for years at Real Madrid by Karim Benzema.\u2018These players get better with time, experience, understanding of the game,\u2019 said former Real manager Mourinho.\u2018When the striker is the kind of goalscorer who can only play in that position it is more difficult, because when they lose that intensity of the young people they have nothing.\u2018Harry and Benzema \u2014 who is 33 now \u2014 are very intelligent so they can drop back and assist, transform their game. Later in their career, instead of being the No 9 target, they become a nine-and-a-half, between a nine and a 10, and they can play football until they want.\u2019\u00a0         Mourinho moved to allay fears that Kane would miss Sunday's north London Derby at Arsenal         When Kane is absent, a mild form of terror is sent racing through the Spurs dressing roomKane\u2019s 10-day absence with minor ankle injuries in January coincided with three successive defeats.Upon his return, Spurs tried to manage his workload and crashed out of the FA Cup at Everton with him on the bench until they were 3-1 down.Defeats at Manchester City and West Ham sent them sliding away from the top four.Three months after climbing to the Premier League summit by beating Arsenal, the fragility of the Mourinho project seemed to be exposed.

He is a divisive figure. It comes with the appointment. His brand is about success and thus easy to judge. There are no shades of grey around footballing philosophies.And yet, such is perspective, down the road Mikel Arteta presides over a worse season at a club far more accustomed to success. \u2018I like Mikel,\u2019 explained Mourinho. \u2018If Arsenal want to give Mikel five, 10 years of peace and no pressure and to develop his job and they believe in him and he believes in the club, I am more than happy with that. I do my job the best I can.\u2019Tottenham have recovered and stabilised. It has been a collective effort.Sergio Reguilon, a key to balance in the team, is back from injury. Gareth Bale has exploded into form out of the blue. Erik Lamela and Lucas Moura are flickering in spring.Davinson Sanchez is emerging from his error-strewn struggles of early season. Tanguy Ndombele and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg continue to impress.And then there is Kane, back in the business of goals and icing his knee as others debate where his footballing future should be. He has scored four goals and made two this week.He has 26 for the season in all competitions. No player has more than Kane\u2019s 11 goals in the north London derby.

        "full article": "By Nancy Lapid March 12 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Kidney problems from COVID-19 are particularly severe Sudden kidney problems from severe COVID-19 appear to be worse, and longer-lasting, than kidney problems that develop in other seriously ill patients, a new study found. Doctors at five hospitals in Connecticut and Rhode Island studied 182 patients with COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) and 1,430 patients with AKI not associated with the coronavirus. The COVID-19 patients had steeper declines in their kidneys' ability to filter waste from the blood while hospitalized, the researchers reported. In addition, among patients whose kidneys were still impaired at hospital discharge, those with COVID-19 were significantly less likely to have recovered to their pre-illness kidney status six months later, and their kidney function was predicted to decline over time at a faster rate than in the other patients. The data, published on Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, show that \"acute kidney injury associated with COVID-19 has a worse prognosis than traditional acute kidney injury,\" said coauthor Dr. Francis Perry Wilson of the Yale University School of Medicine. \"Those with COVID-19 associated acute kidney injuries should probably be monitored more closely than others once they are out of the hospital.\" (https://bit.ly/3rD9G56) Second shot should not be delayed for cancer patients Delayed administration of the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine leaves most cancer patients unprotected, a new report warns. In clinical trials last year, the messenger RNA vaccines were tested with second doses given either three or four weeks after the first depending on the vaccine. In January, the UK decided to delay second doses until 12 weeks. At Kings College London, doctors studied 205 adults who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, including 151 cancer patients. After the first dose, almost all the healthy individuals had strong immune responses, but that was true for fewer than half of patients with solid tumors and fewer than one-in-seven patients with blood cancers, said Dr. Adrian Hayday. When solid-cancer patients got the second dose at the recommended three weeks, 95% developed robust antibody responses. Among those who did not get the booster dose on time because of the UK's new policy, only 43% of solid cancer patients and 8% of blood cancer patients had antibodies at five weeks. \"A single dose of the vaccine left most cancer patients largely or completely unprotected,\" Hayday said. The study report has been submitted ahead of peer review to medRxiv but is not yet online. The data are available on the COVID-Immuno-Phenotype website. (https://bit.ly/3ckwU9O) Prescription mouthwash cuts viral load in saliva A commercially available prescription mouthwash can decrease the amount of the coronavirus in saliva in adults with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, helping to reduce their contagiousness, researchers found. They randomly assigned 154 volunteers, all of whom had been diagnosed within the past week, to rinse three times a day for seven days with a mouthwash containing antiviral beta-cyclodextrin and citrox or a placebo. Four hours after the first use of the antiviral mouthwash, salivary viral load was already significantly reduced, the researchers reported on Wednesday in a paper posted on the preprint server Research Square ahead of peer review. During seven days of treatment, the mouthwash had a particularly beneficial effect on reducing the amount of virus in saliva in patients with high or very high levels to start with, the authors said. \"A one-minute rinse with a beta-cyclodextrin and citrox mouthwash reduces the SARS-CoV-2 salivary viral load by 70%\" in asymptomatic or mildly ill adults, said coauthor Dr. Florence Carrouel of University Lyon in France. \"Thus, this mouthwash is a barrier measure against the spread of COVID-19.\" (https://bit.ly/3lmteZr) mRNA vaccines cut risk of asymptomatic COVID-19 Ten days after receiving a second dose of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna , people without COVID-19 symptoms are far less likely to be carrying the virus and unknowingly spreading it, compared with people who have not been vaccinated, according to Mayo Clinic doctors. Their data, published on Wednesday in Clinical Infectious Diseases, come from 39,000 patients who were routinely tested for COVID-19 before undergoing various medical procedures. More than 48,000 screening tests were performed, including 3,000 on patients who had received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine. Among individuals who had received a single dose of vaccine at least 10 days earlier, they saw a 72% reduction in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. After adjusting for a range of factors, they found an 80% risk reduction of testing positive for COVID-19 among people without symptoms who had gotten both doses. The authors said their findings underscore the fact that messenger RNA vaccines for COVID-19 can help to significantly limit the spread of the virus by people without symptoms.

        "full article": "By Eliana Raszewski BUENOS AIRES, March 12 (Reuters) - Argentine state oil giant YPF said on Friday it would maintain its $2.7 billion 2021 investment plan despite only partially resolving a recent debt crisis, with $1.3 billion of the spending for shale oil and gas production at Vaca Muerta. The investment represents an 73% increase versus 2020, when the firm suffered a severe blow from the drop in international oil prices and lower demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. YPF, which leads activity in Vaca Muerta, one of the largest shale formations in the world, restructured a portion of its debt last month, but fell well short of a larger plan to free up its financing amid a squeeze from the central bank on access to foreign currency. \"In order to make this ambitious activity recovery plan viable, YPF will maintain strict discipline in managing costs, seeking to improve operational efficiencies,\" YPF said in a statement. Vaca Muerta, the size of Belgium, is the world's fourth largest unconventional oil reserve and the second largest for gas. YPF said it would drill 180 new wells in the area. The oil company reported at the beginning of the month that it had a net profit of $539 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, reversing the trend of big losses that it had the rest of last year as a result of the pandemic. The plan includes investing $800 million in conventional hydrocarbons and $600 million in gas this year. (Reporting by Eliana Raszewski. Writing by Adam Jourdan. Editing by Mark Potter)",

        "title": "Cuba accuses Washington of stoking illegal migration after boat tragedy",
        "full article": "By Nelson Acosta HAVANA, March 12 (Reuters) - Cuba accused Washington of stoking illegal migration by not processing visas in Havana and making it relatively easy for Cubans to claim asylum, in the wake of a spate of ill-fated clandestine attempts to reach U.S. shores by boat. The fate of a group of Cubans risking their lives to reach the United States illegally by boat has gripped people on both sides of the Florida Straits after a vessel capsized near the Bahamas a week ago, leaving some people floating in the water for more than 14 hours. While a Royal Bahamas Defence Force ship has rescued 12 people and recovered one body, several others have not yet been found, including women and two children, the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement late on Thursday. Thousands of Cubans used to attempt to emigrate to the United States by boat per year until former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2017 ended a measure granting automatic residence to Cubans who reached U.S. soil, though he left in place some other exceptions to usual migration rules. Since then, the numbers have dropped but still hover around several hundred per year. The U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted 87 people of Cuban origin in the Caribbean in the first six months of the 2021 fiscal year which began on Oct. 1, a spokesman told Reuters. That is an increase on the 49 registered in the full 2020 fiscal year, although this was impacted by the pandemic, and compares with 314 in 2019, the spokesman said. \"Among the factors that constitute incentives for irregular migration are the suspension of the processing and granting of immigrant and non-immigrant visas at the United States Consulate in Havana,\" the Cuban foreign ministry said in its statement. The U.S. State Department Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump drew the U.S. embassy in Havana down to skeletal staffing after a series of unexplained health incidents among its diplomats, moving consular services for Cubans to third countries. Trump's successor, President Joe Biden, vowed during his campaign to reverse some Trump policy shifts that \"have inflicted harm on the Cuban people.\" But hopes he might move quickly restore consular services were dampened when the White House said this week a broad Cuba policy shift is not among Biden's top priorities. Nonetheless, the perception Biden will be more tolerant than Trump towards undocumented migrants, as well as Cuba's deepening economic crisis, are likely also boosting illegal migration this year, said Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. Under a 1966 act, it is also easier for Cubans than migrants from many other places to gain \"political asylum\" and a green card that grants permanent residency. Following the capsizing of the boat off the Bahamas, distraught relatives of the missing pled on Miami television channels for authorities to shed light on the situation, in images widely shared on social media in Cuba. \"I am desperate because these children who were like my children have disappeared,\" said Niurka Caballero, whose two- and four-year-old great niece and nephew were on the boat with their mother. \"Cuba at least found the boat and has said it will continue the search,\" Caballero told Reuters by telephone from the northern coastal town of Caibarien. \"We still have some hope.\" (Reporting by Nelson Acosta Writing by Sarah Marsh Editing by Daniel Flynn and Rosalba O'Brien)",

        "title": "US STOCKS-S&P 500, Nasdaq slip as bond yields rise",
        "full article": "By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 slipped on Friday after hitting an all-time high the prior session as rising U.S. bond yields revived inflation worries and dulled the appeal of high-growth technology shares. The tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled after rebounding more than 6% over the past three sessions, while the blue-chip Dow scaled its fifth consecutive record high. Wall Street's main indexes are set for their best week in five after President Joe Biden signed into law on Thursday one of the largest U.S. fiscal stimulus bills and data reinforced the outlook that the economy was on the path to a recovery. A steady rise in U.S. Treasury yields has raised fears of a sudden tapering of monetary stimulus, pressuring the main U.S. stock indexes in recent weeks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit 1.642%, the highest level since February of last year. The bifurcation of the Dow and Nasdaq reflects an ongoing sell-off in tech as investors buy cyclical and underpriced value stocks that are expected to do well as the economy recovers. For tech stocks to continue to flourish you need low rates, and in effect slower growth, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC. But with the stimulus package the economy is likely to expand 7% to 9% this year and pressure interest rates, he said. \"That's why you're seeing rates rise today because the reopening is happening faster and stronger than anticipated. And that's when value and cyclicals and economically sensitive stocks outperform,\" Hayes said. The speedy distribution of vaccines and more fiscal aid have spurred concerns of rising inflation despite assurances from the Federal Reserve to maintain an accommodative policy. All eyes will be on the central bank's policy meeting next week for further cues on inflation. U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early March to its strongest in a year, a survey by the University of Michigan showed on Friday. By 2:22 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 228.31 points, or 0.7%, at 32,713.9, the S&amp;P 500 was down 7.12 points, or 0.18%, at 3,932.22 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.70 points, or 1.08%, to 13,253.98. The Nasdaq has been particularly hit by the sell-off in recent weeks and confirmed a correction at the start of the week as investors swapped richly valued technology stocks with those of energy, mining and industrial companies that are poised to benefit more from an economic rebound. Value stocks added about 0.6%, while growth stocks slumped 1.1% in a continuation of a rotation that began late last year. The high-flying but yield-sensitive group of stocks including of Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc , Tesla Inc and Microsoft Corp, which fueled the past's year rally, fell. Tech, communication services and consumer discretionary indexes, which house these mega-cap stocks, slipped the most among major S&amp;P sectors. The bank index jumped 1.2%, while financials and industrials clinched new record levels. Ulta Beauty Inc slumped about 8% after the cosmetics retailer forecast annual revenue below estimates, as demand for make-up products were under pressure due to extended work-from-home policies. U.S.-listed shares of China-based JD.com Inc dropped 7% after three sources said it is in talks to buy part or all of a stake in brokerage Sinolink Securities worth at least $1.5 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.25-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&amp;P 500 posted 77 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 375 new highs and 12 new lows.

        "title": "Ailing Sabres look for elusive win vs. Penguins",
        "full article": "The Pittsburgh Penguins aren't going as far as saying games against the Buffalo Sabres are a chance to pile up points in the chase for a playoff spot, but the optics say otherwise. The teams square off again Saturday in Buffalo after Pittsburgh won their first meeting on Thursday, 5-2. That gave the Penguins a four-game winning streak and dropped the struggling Sabres to 0-7-2 over their past nine games. Signs that Pittsburgh is rounding out its game were evident Thursday. The Penguins allowed two or fewer goals for the fourth time in six games this month. Offensively, they got a power-play goal plus a goal from each of their four forward lines. That included one from Anthony Angello, a native New Yorker who grew up a Sabres fan. It was Angello's first goal this season and second of his career, and the first from a Penguins fourth-liner since January. Finding a successful makeup of the fourth line and getting some offense from it has been a season-long concern for Pittsburgh. Angello played with Mark Jankowski and Colton Sceviour. \"The fourth line had a real strong game,\" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. \"They brought a lot of energy. They had some offensive zone time. They possessed the puck down low. They forced Buffalo to expend energy defending them. \"And when Anthony gets a nice goal like that, that's a bonus.\" Buffalo, meanwhile, was already without team captain Jack Eichel, who has been sent out of state for further evaluation of an upper-body injury. Now the Sabres are concerned about rookie Dylan Cozens, who recently was promoted to center the top line. Cozens left Thursday's game in the third period after taking a hit from Pittsburgh's Zach Aston-Reese that sent him into the boards. Cozens did not practice Friday. His teammate, Colin Miller, jumped in after the hit to fight Aston-Reese, who was not penalized for the hit. \"I think it has to be a penalty -- and good for (Miller) jumping in there, but really difficult when you see a player exposed like that and you give him a push right in the numbers at that distance,\" Buffalo coach Ralph Krueger said. Given the mounting losses, both in terms of games and injuries, Buffalo is searching for positives. One could be Victor Olofsson, who has been strong on the power play with six goals but on Thursday scored a five-on-five goal for the first time since the season opener. \"I'm trying to work on it,\" Olofsson said of his even-strength production. \"Obviously, I haven't been good five-on-five at all this year. Just been trying to get more pucks to the net and stay around the net. I think these last few games I've been getting more opportunities and finally get to score one, but I've still got a lot of improvements there.\" The latter thought could apply to the Sabres as a whole, and Krueger said he hopes his players will use the hit on Cozens and a knee-on-knee hit Thursday by Pittsburgh's Chad Ruhwedel on Rasmus Dahlin to provide some motivation. \"Nothing's coming easy, that's for sure,\" Krueger said. \"We need to prepare ourselves for a reaction. We've got Pittsburgh again. The hits on Dylan and Rasmus, they're boiling the blood right now, and we just need to show reaction.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "The birth of one of the world's rarest species of giraffes was caught in this heartwarming CCTV footage.The adorable 70kg Rothschild baby was welcomed into the world at Chester Zoo on Wednesday.Incredible CCTV captured the moment the unnamed male 6ft tall giraffe was born as he dropped onto a bed of soft straw from a height of two metres from mum Orla.And it later showed the gangly calf making his first tentative steps and suckling from his mother.                Mother Orla (above) gently nuzzles against her newborn calf at Chester ZooOrla and ten-year-old dad Meru's fifth baby brings fresh hope for the species, which is one of the world's most endangered mammals - with only 1,600 left in the wild.One of nine subspecies of giraffes, a third of the remaining population live in zoos with the rest in Southern Africa.Sarah Roffe, giraffe team manager at the zoo, said: 'Giraffes give birth standing up and so their young receive quite a welcome to the world, dropping around six feet to the ground.

Footage showed the newborn taking its first unsteady steps shortly after his birth during the week         The birth of the six-foot calf, which could grow to as high as 18ft, was caught on CCTV'Orla, an experienced mother, has slipped back into the role like a natural. She's doing everything right, and it's lovely to see the close bond between the two of them.'This latest arrival joins a group of eight Rothschild's giraffes at the zoo and it's always an exciting time for the herd when a new calf arrives.'Two of the older females, Dagmar and Tula, appear to have taken on the role of protective aunties, helping Orla to watch out for the newborn.'The other youngsters in the group love running around together and so, as soon as the calf starts to increase in confidence and venture outside, I'm sure they'll enjoy having a new playmate around.'The Rothschild's giraffe is highly threatened and its population has suffered a 50 per cent decline in recent decades, making it one of the world's most at-risk mammals.         The calf suckles on his mother as he gets to grips with his new home in Chester Zoo         Keeper Caroline Wright puts down clean straw for the newborn calf, born to Orla and MeruExperts estimate that as few as 1,600 remain across Africa with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) citing habitat loss and poaching as two of its biggest threats.Mike Jordan, director of animals and plants at the zoo, said: 'Once wide-ranging across Kenya, Uganda and Sudan, the Rothschild's giraffe has been almost eliminated from these areas and now only survives in a few small, isolated populations.'Encouragingly, they are starting to recover with the support of conservation programmes such as those supported by Chester Zoo.'But they're still threatened with habitat loss and an ongoing poaching crisis, which has seen giraffes hunted for their tails to be used as good-luck charms.'Working with The Giraffe Conservation Foundation and Uganda Wildlife Authority to monitor, track and protect the giraffe population in Uganda's Kidepo Valley National Park, we're delighted that even with the challenges the pandemic has thrown our way, numbers are slowly increasing.'Its positive news and we must push on and do all we can to help prevent the extinction of these gentle giants.' WHAT IS A ROTHSCHILD'S GIRAFFE?\u00a0           Rothschild's giraffes are distinct because they have no markings below the kneeThe giraffe group, or subspecies, was first named by Lord Walter Rothschild for their distinctive markings.Unlike other giraffes, they had broader dividing white lines on their bodies and no spots beneath their knees.The group originally ranged across Kenya, Uganda and Sudan, but the pressures of farming, conflict and poaching have pushed them into a few small, isolated areas.\u00a0In 2002 this meant they numbered just nine individuals in Kidepo Valley Conservation Area, Uganda.Although their population is now increasing, according to the IUCN, it had previously fallen from 90 per cent.\u00a0There are estimated to be less than 2,650 individuals left in the wild.Giraffes were hunted for their tails, which were used as good luck charms, sewing threads and even fly swats.They are hunted by hyenas, lions, crocodiles and leopards.\u00a0 Advertisement",

Yet UK cruise lines have been quietly using the past 12 months to invest millions in health and safety measures, and many are now tweaking itineraries to sail in home waters.\u00a0Last week, P&O and Princess Cruises rescheduled this summer's sailings to include a programme of long weekends and short breaks from Southampton, while Saga and Fred Olsen Cruises will start up in June. Both companies are expected to test passengers for Covid before boarding and Saga will also require proof of vaccination.         With the vaccination programme well under way, there is growing confidence among industry leaders the Government will give the thumbs up to international cruises later in the year WHAT CAN WE EXPECT ON BOARD?\u00a0 We have all got used to face masks, hand sanitising and social distancing \u2014 and life on board will be little different.Cruise lines have invested in onboard Covid testing labs and new air ventilation systems, while health and safety protocols have been overhauled. Ships will be sailing with reduced capacity to make social distancing easier.So far, only Saga Cruises, American Queen Steamboat and Victory Cruise have ruled that passengers must be fully vaccinated before embarkation.         Health and safety protocols have been overhauled on cruise ships\u00a0Norwegian Cruise Lines, Regent Seven Seas and Swan Hellenic have stipulated crew must be vaccinated.Crystal Cruises will also require vaccinations \u2018once they are widely available\u2019 while Royal Caribbean says it is \u2018committed to requiring crew to have the vaccine\u2019.BOARDING: Expect extra queuing for testing and electronic form-filling.

It will be anti-clockwise round Britain sailing to Dover.The decision to allow sailing in home waters follows policies in other countries. In Italy, MSC Cruises and Costa have been cruising in the Mediterranean since last summer. Hapag-Lloyd and Aida Cruises have been sailing from Germany to the Canaries, and Royal Caribbean's Odyssey of the Seas is due to sail in a loop from Israel in May.Antonio Paradiso, MSC Cruises UK & Ireland managing director, said: 'Since our European restart in August last year, we have carried more than 40,000 guests. We are delighted by the decision to enable UK passengers to cruise again.'Hear, hear \u2014 and let's hope international cruises are next to open up.\u00a0 Our guide to sailing off the British coast\u00a0Cruises around the British Isles from English ports are back \u2014 and there are discussions with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for a UK-wide restart (likely by June).This does not prevent cruises from England travelling around British waters; they just cannot, as things stand, stop at ports in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\u00a0However, when these countries give the green light, as is expected next week, yet more British-based holidays are likely from Scotland on Hebridean Island Cruises (hebridean.co.uk) and the Majestic Line (themajesticline.co.uk). The earliest cruises from England start in June, as it will take time for ships to be prepared.

How likely is it that I will be able to go on a summer cruise?A. Very strong, when it comes to British Isles cruises. This week's Government announcement that domestic voyages are OK from English ports from May 17 has effectively restarted cruise holidays. The first are likely in June.Q. What do you mean 'restarted' \u2014 haven't all holidays been illegal recently?A. Yes. However, even before the lockdown, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office advised against all 'sea-going' cruises.

You say 'sea-going' \u2014 what were the rules on river cruises?A. River cruises were not included in the FCDO ban, so these had been possible.Q. I want to go to the Caribbean, the Med or somewhere else hot. Can I?A. Not unless Government rules change to allow foreign travel. The FCDO advice against 'sea-going' trips would have to be cancelled, too. If both of these happened then, in theory, yes.Q. Great, so I can book a cruise trip to the sun this summer right now?A. Not so fast. There are two further considerations. First: most cruise holidays in hot places are not being offered until October, as cruise lines are wary of travel restrictions in the UK and overseas (though msccruises.co.uk, tui.co.uk, royalcaribbean.com, iglucruise.com and celestyal.com do have a few).Q. Wait, you mentioned a second consideration \u2014 what is it?A. You must carefully read cruise line terms and conditions. The key word is 'flexibility'. Cruise lines have been introducing flexible terms so you can postpone or receive a credit voucher if you cancel.

But what happens if the cruise line itself cancels my booking?A. You will be due a refund under the Package Travel Regulations, if your trip involved a flight. If it did not include a flight, most companies will offer refunds anyway.Q. Can you tell me if I'll need a Covid test before boarding? And will I need to prove I have been vaccinated?A. Saga is the only UK cruise line currently requiring all passengers to be vaccinated. It is expected that others will use rapid Covid tests before boarding.Q. How about if I test positive for Covid before I board the ship?A. The cruise line will probably allow you to postpone your trip; again, check the terms and conditions.Q. I love a cruise and all this sounds worth the risk. Are there any good deals?A. Possibly: check for incentives such as free spa treatments, cabin upgrades, free wifi and onboard credits, says Adam Coulter, managing editor of Cruise Critic. Richard Downs of iglu.com agrees, and adds that last-minute deals may be possible.

        "full article": "WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Friday demanded the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) release a contract it awarded to Oshkosh Corp that could be worth $6 billion to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles. Some Democrats in Congress have been critical that the USPS awarded a multibillion-dollar, 10-year contract to Oshkosh Defense, a unit of Oshkosh Corp, to build a mix of gasoline-powered and electric delivery vehicles instead of choosing Workhorse Group Inc to build an all-electric fleet. Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat who chairs the committee that oversees the USPS, said \"a thorough review is warranted to ensure the award process is free from undue influence and potential interference.\" She demanded USPS release the final contract, all offers submitted, records of negotiations and evaluation factors by March 26. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has committed to at least 10% of the fleet being electric vehicles but he said in a letter on Thursday that with government assistance the USPS could commit to making a majority of the fleet electric within 10 years. He added that the USPS needs about $8 billion to electrify the new fleet to the \"maximum extent\" feasible. (Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

        "full article": "On Feb. 9, the Brooklyn Nets held a 14-12 record and were not winning as consistently as they anticipated. After an ugly loss to the Detroit Pistons that day, new coach Steve Nash's message to his team focused on improved connectivity while players vowed to play better defensively. Since then, the Nets are the NBA's hottest team, and they will attempt to keep rolling Saturday night when they host those same Pistons. They are 11-1 since that ugly night in Detroit. During the hot streak, the Nets are allowing 110.6 points per game -- down from 118.4 -- and eight of those wins have been by double digits. The latest was Thursday's 121-109 win over the Boston Celtics, when Kyrie Irving tied a season-high 40 points, including two clutch 3-pointers in the final three-plus minutes. \"He's just different. He's a different breed,\" Nets guard James Harden said of Irving. \"He has that killer mentality in a sense of, no matter who we play or where we're playing, he is going to go out there and try to destroy the opponent and that's something that you'd want on your team at all times.\" The Nets have played all but one game since Feb. 9 without Kevin Durant, who will miss his 11th straight game with a hamstring injury. Despite missing Durant, Brooklyn's offense is humming. The Nets have scored more than 120 points eight times, shot at least 50 percent five times and hit at least 15 3-pointers nine times during this run. Blake Griffin scored nine points in 31 minutes for Detroit in its win over the Nets in February but now has flipped locker rooms. The Nets signed him Monday after Detroit waived him last Saturday, though he has yet to play for Brooklyn as he works his way back into shape. \"Blake's a small-ball 5 who can make open 3s,\" Nash said. \"He's really good in the half-roll playmaking, playing four-on-three, three-on-two, two-on-one. He's an intelligent player, has great experience. So, there's plenty of ways he can adapt and help.\" Detroit is 4-9 since the previous meeting with the Nets. Despite owning the fewest wins (10) in the Eastern Conference, the Pistons have wins over the Los Angeles Lakers, Celtics, Miami Heat and Phoenix Suns on the season. Detroit is coming off a 105-102 loss at the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday. The Pistons shot 44.7 percent and hit 15 3-pointers in a game they trailed by as many as 16 points. The Pistons have scored fewer than 110 points in 10 games since the last meeting with the Nets, though they are shooting 39.8 percent from 3-point range in the past three games. In the last meeting with Brooklyn, Jerami Grant scored 32 points -- one of his eight 30-point games this season. Grant also scored 32 points Thursday against the Hornets when he hit 11 of 24 shots and added eight rebounds in a game in which coach Dwane Casey used 12 players. \"First of all, we haven't played in almost a week,\" Casey said. \"Guys were a little winded, they were in the same thing, I don't know how many guys they played. But I think both teams were just trying to get fresh bodies in, and you know getting guys a blow, and I thought everybody who came in the game did an excellent job.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "SAO PAULO (AP) - Brazil\u00b4s federal government said Friday it has reached a deal to purchase 10 million doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, though the shot is yet to be approved by the South American nation\u00b4s health agency. The Brazilian Health Ministry said on Twitter that the jabs will be imported by Uni\u00e3o Qu\u00edmica, a company that has lobbied the government to purchase the vaccines, though its own experience is based on other medical products. Brazil\u00b4s government expects to receive 400,000 shots in April, 2 million in May and another 7.6 million by June. The ministry said it would also evaluate possible production of the Sputnik V vaccine by Uni\u00e3o Qu\u00edmica plants in Brazil. Brazil has already secured contracts for 200 million vaccine doses, half made by AstraZeneca and half by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac. Russia has sent millions of doses of Sputnik V around the world, even as it vaccinates its own population. Analysts say Russia seeks to bolster its image as a benevolent technological power at a time when COVID-19 jabs are in short supply because richer nations are stockpiling Western-made vaccines.

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)  According to Our World in Data, an online research site that compares official government statistics, only 5.5% of Brazilians have been vaccinated, and the country experiences a deadly second wave of COVID-19 with more than 2,000 registered deaths in each of the last two days. More than 270,000 people died of the disease in Brazil, with authorities expecting grim weeks in March and April.",

        "full article": "A \u201cpositive meeting\u201d has been held to discuss the upcoming Old Firm game after a Scottish Government minister threatened the fixture could be postponed. Thousands of Rangers fans breached lockdown rules last weekend to celebrate the side\u2019s first league win in a decade, leading to worries the scenes could be repeated on March 21 at Celtic Park. Sport Minister Mairi Gougeon and Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf were involved in the talks on Friday alongside representatives from Police Scotland, Glasgow City Council and the two clubs. Speaking after the meeting, Ms Gougeon said: \u201cThis was a positive meeting which we called to address the need for fans to stay at home during the upcoming fixture on March 21. \u201cThe reason we have allowed elite football to proceed is as much for the benefit of supporters as for those working in professional sport. \u201cEveryone is being deprived of so much right now \u2013 and making so many sacrifices \u2013 that the ability to watch a football game safely at home on television should be something that people should have the ability to do. \u201cBut a minority cannot be allowed to act irresponsibly. We want to send out a very clear message that all fans must stay at home \u2013 there will be opportunities to come together to celebrate safely, collectively in due course. \u201cClubs have a leading role to play in reaching out to their supporters and communicating the vital message that fans and supporters need to stay at home. I welcome that both clubs have agreed to reinforce that message. \u201cWe still face a very real threat from the highly transmissible new variant and cannot risk people\u2019s health at this time, when we are at the very cusp of easing some restrictions.\u201d It comes after Mr Yousaf tweeted the game would be postponed if there was any police intelligence saying fans were about to \u201csquare off\u201d against each other. On upcoming Celtic Vs Rangers match, we need clear messaging from everyone that fans must stay at home. If Police intelligence tells us, despite clear messaging, that groups of fans are going to gather to square off with each other, we need to consider if game should be postponed\u2014 Humza Yousaf (@HumzaYousaf) March 12, 2021   Mr Yousaf said: \u201cWe are grateful to Police Scotland, Glasgow City Council, and Celtic and Rangers football clubs for agreeing to join discussions arranged by the Scottish Government. These were constructive discussions. \u201cOur collective efforts are very much on ensuring the upcoming fixture between the two clubs is spoken about for events on the pitch, not off. \u201cWe are pleased that the football clubs involved agreed to communicate robust messaging, stating unequivocally, that fans should stay at home. \u201cHowever, if police intelligence tells us, despite clear messaging, large groups of fans are going to gather and put public health at risk, we will need to very seriously consider taking action. Powers are open to us on that front. \u201cWe are at the most critical juncture in our fight against the virus and we cannot, and simply will not, tolerate the shameful scenes we witnessed recently. We will await to see the action from all partners involved and update Parliament next week. \u201cLet me reiterate that this meeting was positive and partners engaged very constructively.\u201d A statement from the Ibrox side said: \u201cRangers can confirm we took part in a multi-agency meeting this afternoon with representatives from the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council, Police Scotland and Celtic FC. \u201cThis is to continue an open and constructive dialogue in relation to the upcoming Old Firm fixture at Parkhead on Sunday March 21. \u201cWe are pleased that today\u2019s meeting was very constructive and we have agreed to support the \u2018stay at home\u2019 message. \u201cRangers would like to reiterate manager Steven Gerrard\u2019s comments from last weekend, for supporters to stay at home and ensure the safety of themselves and others. \u201cWe are cognisant of the ongoing fight against Covid-19 and ask that everyone follows Government guidance to stay at home. \u201cThe club will continue to liaise with all agencies as well as a number of supporters. We will continue to work to ensure that the club\u2019s message is reiterated over the coming week and will provide further updates in due course.\u201d #CelticFC statement \u2b07\ufe0f\u2014 Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC) March 12, 2021   Earlier on Friday, Celtic released a statement saying they had been clear about the need for fans to follow the rules throughout the pandemic \u2013 a message they would \u201cre-emphasise\u201d ahead of the game. The club said: \u201cThe Scottish Government has already made clear to Celtic that it does not in any way associate the scenes last weekend with Celtic or our supporters. \u201cAlthough Celtic and our supporters are desperate to get back to Celtic Park to support the team, the club and our supporters are of course mindful of the risks associated with public gatherings at this important time. \u201cWe have communicated regularly around our fixtures and our supporters have worked with the club responsibly; the celebrations after our historic nine-in-a-row title triumph last summer and after our unprecedented quadruple treble Scottish Cup win in December are two key examples of that. \u201cWe will re-emphasise that message for this fixture as we have done during the season and we are sure that our supporters will work with the club while the restrictions remain in place.\u201d Chief Constable Iain Livingstone said: \u201cI am grateful to both football clubs, Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Government for these positive and constructive discussions. \u201cDiscussions will continue in the days ahead to work together with the people of Glasgow, and Scotland, to make sure that public safety is maintained. \u201cIt is vital everybody demonstrates personal and collective responsibility to support the public health imperative.\u201d",

        "full article": "By Michelle Nichols and Lisa Barrington NEW YORK/DUBAI, March 12 (Reuters) - The United Nations World Food Programme is hoping to get a share of hundreds of millions of dollars from a private foundation set up to help Yemen by U.S. private equity investor Tim Collins, U.N. food chief David Beasley said on Friday. More than six years of war in Yemen - widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran - have sent the impoverished country spiraling into what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis. In a document shared with aid groups and seen by Reuters, the 2021 Famine Prevention Foundation aims to \"avert a widespread famine by getting immediate assistance to the maximum number of people\" experiencing famine or on the brink of famine. Beasley said that he has spoken with Collins several times about the foundation, which has yet to be publicly announced. \"Tim's working hard on a private foundation of funds,\" Beasley told reporters. \"He expressed his concerns about the governments around the world being stretched because of the crisis that we're now facing because of COVID.\" Collins, founder of U.S. private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC, declined to comment. Most funding for U.N. aid appeals comes from governments, so the creation of the Famine Prevention Foundation is novel. Contributors to the fund are thought to include entities in Gulf countries, an aid source told Reuters. Aid agency Action Contre la Faim told The New Humanitarian media outlet, which first reported on the new fund this month, that the money was thought to have come from private Gulf entities. \"The aim of the fund is to demonstrate that the U.N. can promptly scale up responses when given the means to do so ... it is a way to reassure donors, in particular Gulf donors,\" the aid source said. The foundation is being run by John Ging, former director of U.N. aid operations, and Neal Keny-Guyer, the former chief executive of Mercy Corps aid organization, said two sources familiar with the situation. Earlier this month countries only pledged $1.7 billion for humanitarian aid in Yemen - less than half the $3.85 billion the United Nations was seeking for 2021 to avert a large-scale famine. DUE DILIGENCE Beasley estimated the foundation would have sums in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) Yemen director Mohammed Abdi said the group had applied for money from the foundation. \"These funds, if received, will be a much-needed addition to our work,\" he said. \"Far more money is still needed, along with concerted international action to bring about an immediate ceasefire in Yemen and stop pushing millions more into starvation and misery.\" While it's not clear where the money for the foundation has come from, both Beasley and Abdi said accountability and due diligence had been carried out. Abdi said it had received assurances from the foundation that if the Norwegian Refugee Council receives a grant it will be \"free to provide assistance based only on the needs of the most vulnerable.\" Some 80% of Yemenis need help, with 400,000 children under the age of 5 severely malnourished and more than half the population of the Arabian Peninsula country - 16 million people - are going hungry, according to U.N. data. A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the country's government from Sanaa. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system. The people's suffering has been worsened by an economic and currency collapse, and by the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "full article": "March 12 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee said on Friday it is not a \"super world government\" that can resolve political issues in China ahead of the Beijing 2022 Olympic Games even though activists say the IOC has ignored Tibetan and Uighur claims of human rights violations. Beijing will become the first city to host summer and winter Games next year after also staging the 2008 summer Games. But the IOC has been criticised for awarding the 2022 winter Olympics to China given the country's human rights record. Representatives of Tibetan and Hong Kong groups as well as the world's largest group of exiled ethnic Uighurs said earlier on Friday the IOC had not acted on their concerns after meeting them in October. They also said any assurances from China to the IOC were of no value. \"We are taking this very seriously,\" IOC President Thomas Bach told a news conference when asked specifically about claims of rights violations in China. \"Human rights and labour rights and others are and will be part of the host city contract.\" \"We are working very closely with the organising committee. We are monitoring supply chains, labour rights, freedom of press and many other issues. This is our responsibility,\" he said at the end of a virtual IOC session. The United States earlier on Friday condemned China's abuse of ethnic and religious minorities, including what it called \"crimes against humanity and genocide\" in Xinjiang against Muslim Uighurs and severe restrictions in Tibet. \"We are not a super world government where the IOC could solve or even address issues for which not a United Nations security council, no G7, no G20 has a solution,\" Bach said. \"This is in the remit of politics. We have to live up to our responsibilities in our areas of responsibility.\" China rejects U.S. charges that it has committed genocide against Uighur and other Muslims in the remote western region, where activists say more than 1 million are held in internment camps. Beijing says the complexes it set up in Xinjiang provide vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism. Allegations of forced labour and human rights violations are \"groundless rumour and slander\", the Chinese foreign ministry says.

She is also accused of restraining students and allowing her husband to have continued contact with several girls after he physically assaulted them.While the couple is finally being brought to justice, Amanda said it took years for authorities to take action despite her 'multiple' attempts to report the abuse.\u00a0'It's bittersweet, I don't know how to put it. I am more frustrated that it took so long to get the school closed down. The abuse was first reported in 2007 after the parents of one of the girls found out what my parents were doing to the students,' she said.\u00a0'The parents contacted 11 different agencies and nothing was done. They contacted the Attorney General and the FBI and nothing was done.\u00a0Hundreds of girls could have been saved from abuse, including sexual abuse, if authorities had only listened. I tried to expose what was going on multiple times, but no one believed me.'\u00a0'When I saw the mugshots, I thought my mom would be smiling but she looked mad and my dad's face was red so he had probably been crying. When he used to beat me, he would cry afterwards to make me feel like he felt bad, but it was just all for show.'\u00a0\u00a0'Exactly a year ago is when I created Exposing Circle of Hope and talked about it on TikTok. I encouraged other girls to come forward and talk about the abuse.\u00a0              Amanda, now 28, told DailyMail.com how she and her classmates were forced to gang up on their own peers as a form of punishment. She also revealed how it took years for authorities to finally take action against the school\u00a0\u00a0'It paid off because more and more girls came forward until authorities took notice and finally went to the school to see what was going on. But it took another year to finally arrest my parents and permanently shut down the school.'The account even got the attention of Paris Hilton, who has claimed to be a victim of abuse herself while attending a reform school in Utah as a teen.\u00a0\u00a0Amanda said Hilton started following her Exposing Circle of Hope Instagram page last year when she posted the disturbing video of her parents.\u00a0The social media account eventually paid off in the form of a search warrant being conducted in September of 2020.\u00a0Weeks prior, all 25 students were removed from the school by state authorities and moved to a different facility.

This is wrong and he needs to be held accountable for his actions,' she said.'So many girls remain silent in fear and then when they finally leave at age 18, they are left with anxiety, depression, insomnia and suicidal thoughts.'\u00a0Attorney General Eric Schmitt said during a news conference Wednesday that the alleged victims also said they were forced to shovel manure for hours on end, stand with their noses against a wall while handcuffed for days at a time, and were locked in rooms without beds or lights.He said: 'Today, my Office has filed a total of 102 criminal charges against Boyd and Stephanie Householder, proprietors of the now-defunct Circle of Hope Girls Ranch and Boarding School.'The charging documents allege extensive, and horrific, sexual, physical, and mental abuse perpetrated by the Householders.\u00a0'There are no words that I can say here today to describe the mixture of great sadness, horror, disgust and sympathy that I feel about these reports of cruel and almost unbelievable abuse and neglect,' Schmitt said. 'We intend to do everything in the power of this office to get justice for these victims.'",

        "title": "Firefighters called to plant where earlier gas leak killed 6",
        "full article": "ATLANTA (AP) - A refrigeration company and firefighters were called to a northeast Georgia chicken processing plant where a liquid nitrogen leak killed six workers in January. The continuing concern at the Foundation Food Group plant in Gainesville came as the Hall County Sheriff's Office announced autopsy results for the dead workers Friday. All were found to have died from \"asphyxia due to, or as a consequence of liquid nitrogen exposure.\" Hall County firefighters said they were called to the plant about 4 p.m. Thursday concerning an ammonia leak that may have happened around 9:30 a.m. \"Hall County Fire Services has responded to the location, evaluated the scene, and found no hazards, including ammonia, to be present,\" Division Chief Zach Brackett wrote in an email. It's unclear if there was an ammonia release earlier. The company released a statement but didn't respond to specific questions. \"After a review of the Foundation Food Group prepared foods facility today by a professional refrigeration company, no actionable levels of ammonia were found, and the plant was cleared of any potential risk to the company\u00b4s employees,\" the statement said in part.          In this Friday, Jan. 29, 2021 file photo, Hall County firefighters enter a back door at Foundation Food Group in Gainesville, Ga., the day after six people were killed following a liquid nitrogen leak at the plant. Firefighters were called to the plant again on Thursday, March 11 after concerns over a possible ammonia leak, but firefighters and plant officials say no harmful levels of ammonia were found. Autopsy results released Friday, March 12 show all six workers killed in January died of asphyxiation because of liquid nitrogen exposure. (Scott Rogers/The Times via AP, File)  The U.S. Chemical Safety Board said Foundation Food had recently installed a liquid nitrogen freezing system on some of its production lines that released a smothering cloud of the gas on Jan. 28. Nine other workers were sent to the hospital and later released, including one who was hospitalized for weeks. The company resumed operations at the plant weeks later. It takes chicken slaughtered elsewhere and prepares items such as patties and nuggets for food service operations. The liquid nitrogen system was installed to replace an older refrigeration system that used ammonia, the Chemical Safety Board said. It's unclear whether Thursday's concerns centered on the same production line where January's release occurred or was somewhere else in the plant. Eric Lucero, a spokesperson for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said the workplace safety agency \"has been provided limited information,\" but is \"actively looking into the circumstances surrounding the event.\" The Chemical Safety Board did not respond to questions. Neither agency has yet released findings from investigations of the January liquid nitrogen release. Families of a number of dead workers have filed lawsuits against the German company that made the liquid nitrogen system, Messer Group, and a Messer employee who visited the plant in the days before the leak to service the system. Those suits allege Messer and the worker are at fault for failing to properly inspect, test, repair or shut down the system before the liquid nitrogen release. ___ Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy.",

The settlement is the \"largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in US history,\" the lawyers said in a statement. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is currently on trial facing murder and manslaughter charges in connection with Floyd's May 25, 2020 death, which was captured on video by bystanders and seen around the globe. Three other police officers also face charges. \"George Floyd's horrific death, witnessed by millions of people around the world, unleashed a deep longing and undeniable demand for justice and change,\" said Ben Crump, a Floyd family lawyer. \"That the largest pre-trial settlement in a wrongful death case ever would be for the life of a Black man sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end,\" Crump said. The settlement results from a federal lawsuit the Floyd family filed in July against the city of Minneapolis. Floyd's brother Rodney said the agreement is \"a necessary step for all of us to begin to get some closure.\" \"George's legacy for those who loved him will always be his spirit of optimism that things can get better, and we hope this agreement does just that,\" he said.",

The annual list of the year's most dreadful movies is the one award show no Hollywood star wants to feature in, but Donald Trump's lawyer Giuliani bagged two spots in nominations Friday. The satirical film sequel about a fictional Kazakh journalist saw Giuliani tricked into a fake hotel room \"interview\" with Borat's attractive and flirtatious young daughter, played by Maria Bakalova. The scene ended with Giuliani apparently reaching into his trousers, oblivious to the hidden cameras, although he later insisted he was tucking in his shirt. Giuliani is up for worst supporting actor, and worst screen combo along with Bulgarian actress Bakalova, who was nominated for a Golden Globe and is tipped for Oscars recognition for her role. Also straddling the good and bad of awards shows is Glenn Close, who donned heavy makeup to play chain-smoking Appalachian matriarch \"Mamaw\" in Netflix's divisive \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Close was nominated at the Globes and is seen as a contender for the Oscar nominations to be unveiled Monday, but earned a Razzie nod for worst supporting actress. Leading the Razzies contenders overall were Robert Downey Jr's critically panned \"Dolittle\" remake, and Netflix's Polish erotic drama \"365 Days,\" each earning six nods. The year 2020 itself will be granted a \"Special Governor's Trophy\" for \"The Worst Calendar Year Ever.\" Formally known as the Golden Raspberry Awards, the Razzies are handed out the day before the Oscars, serving to mock the following night's self-congratulatory Tinseltown pageantry. The Razzies were first awarded in 1981 in a Los Angeles living room, the brainchild of UCLA film graduates and industry veterans, who chose the raspberry as a symbol of derision.",

        "title": "Sotheby's to auction rare stamps, gold coin from Stuart Weitzman's personal collection",
        "full article": "By Angela Moore March 12 (Reuters) - A 'Three Treasures' sale of rare stamps and a gold coin from the personal collection of shoe designer Stuart Weitzman is set to fetch millions of dollars at an auction at Sotheby's in New York City in June. The 1933 Double Eagle Coin was originally cast as a $20 coin, but it was never issued for use. After U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt took the country off the gold standard, all of the Double Eagles were ordered destroyed. However, a handful were released and all but one of them deemed stolen. Now, the only 1933 Double Eagle Coin ever allowed to be privately owned is up for sale at Sotheby's, with the auction house estimating the coin will sell for between $10 million and $15 million. The exquisite design of the Double Eagle has led to it being described as the \"Mona Lisa of coins,\" said Sotheby's Luxury Division Senior Vice President, Richard Austin. \"It's America's most famous gold coin. It's the only one. There are other examples, but they're all owned by the U.S. Mint.\" The \"Three Treasures\" sale also includes the British Guiana One-Cent Magenta stamp and a plate block of the \"Inverted Jenny\" stamp. Issued in 1856, the Magenta is the rarest stamp in the world and the only stamp of its kind. Weitzman bought the stamp in 2014 for $9.48 million dollars, according to Sotheby's - about one billion times its face value. It is now expected to sell for between $10 million and $15 million. The plate of the \"Inverted Jenny\" stamp is expected to fetch between $5 million and $7 million. The 24-cent stamp issued in 1918 is the most recognized and sought-after U.S. stamp. Austin said the three items are \"the very best examples and the rarest in their respective categories.\" \"Stuart was, I think, groundbreaking in the way that he collected, which instead of having a lot of one thing, he simply had the best in any given area. And that includes stamps and coins,\" said Austin. He said each item has had some sort of mishap or mistake that makes them valuable. The Double Eagle coin went overseas to King Farouk in Egypt before the government was able to halt its export, said Austin. \"In the case of the British Guiana, it was a case of the stamps that had been printed in England didn't make it over to the colony, so they decided to print their own. And this is the only one that survived,\" said Austin, adding that the stamp was found by a 12-year-old boy 20 years later. And on the 'Inverted Jenny'? The biplane is upside down. The three items will be on display to the public, by appointment, at Sotheby's in New York through March 17. The auction is on June 8.

        "full article": "President Joe Biden took a victory lap in the White House Rose Garden Friday after signing the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package the day before.\u00a0'For the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this nation first,' Biden told a small crowd of Democratic Congressional leaders, adding the caveat that the rich aren't 'bad folks.'\u00a0\u00a0He added that it was time to 'build an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.'\u00a0         President Joe Biden speaks in the White House Rose Garden at an event marking the passage of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion COVID relief package passed by Democrats in the House and Senate         President Joe Biden (from left) leads Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from the Oval Office into the Rose Garden Friday\u00a0         Democratic lawmakers were in the audience Friday and their seats were kept far apart due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic\u00a0Biden appeared in the Rose Garden alongside Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris.\u00a0Other Democratic lawmakers were the seated guests.\u00a0Schumer, Pelosi and Harris all made the point to say that 'help is on the way.'\u00a0When it got to the president's turn he uttered, 'I guess it's becoming an overused phrase,' before saying it again.\u00a0The package includes $1,400 stimulus checks, extended umemployment benefits, a child tax credit that will raise millions out of poverty, as well as money for vaccinations and to help reopen schools.\u00a0'It changes the paradigm,' Biden said, pointing out how Washington has used tax cuts for years to drive economic stimulus, with financial benefits for the rich - in theory - trickling down to those at the bottom. ''We've seen time and time again that the trickle down doesn't work, by the way,' the president noted.\u00a0'We don't have anything against wealthy people,' he said again.\u00a0\u00a0Biden made sure progressive Democrats were represented by singling out\u00a0his former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, as he was doing a round of thank yous to those seated in the audience.\u00a0       'And I want to say to Bernie, Bernie stepping up and making the case about why this was so transformational made a big difference in how a lot of people voted,' Biden said.\u00a0He also told the socially distant audience that he wished he could greet them all properly.\u00a0'Wish I could come out and shake hands with every one of you, but next time we won't be so far apart,' the president said.\u00a0Biden had let Schumer, Pelosi and Harris all speak before he walked up to the podium.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Everybody is complimenting us and I, every time we get a compliment I say, I accept on behalf of the House Democrats and of the staff of the House Democrats and I know of the Senate staff as well,' Pelosi said.\u00a0\u00a0She thanked Biden as well.\u00a0'Yes, this is a great day to be in the Rose Garden and to have us be able to fulfill the promise that President Biden has made all along - that help is on the way. Promise made, promise fulfilled,' she added.\u00a0Harris brought up her shared Senate past with Biden when it was her turn to talk.\u00a0'And we both served in the Senate, so we know there's rarely been a bill that's so concrete and tangible,' the vice president said.\u00a0'Mr. President, people will feel, and they will see, what we all did here,' she said. 'They will see the checks in their bank accounts, they will see the child tax credits when they file their taxes, when they return to work, when they return to school, and they reopen their businesses.'\u00a0'When they hug their grandchildren for the first time in a year,' Harris said.\u00a0At the conclusion of the event, Biden ignored a reporter's shouted question about vaccines.\u00a0Later, as he departed for a weekend in Delaware, he ignored another question about the fate of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\u00a0\u00a0         First lady Jill Biden (right) and second gentleman Doug Emhoff (left) are shown greeting visitors in the White House Rose Garden\u00a0         Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Hosue Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrate the passage of the COVID-19 stimulus package in the White House Rose Garden Friday\u00a0 BIDEN'S AUDIENCE AT THE ROSE GARDEN PARTY\u00a0 Leadership\u00b7 Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00b7 Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00b7 Majority Leader Steny Hoyer\u00b7 Majority Whip Jim Clyburn\u00b7 Chairwoman Patty Murray\u00b7 Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow\u00b7 Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar\u00b7 President Pro Tempore Patrick LeahyChairs of Relevant Committees\u00b7 Senator Bernie Sanders, Budget Committee Chair\u00b7 Senator Gary Peters, Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee Chair\u00b7 Senator Ben Cardin, Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee Chair\u00b7 Senator Sherrod Brown, Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Chair\u00b7 Congressman John Yarmuth, Budget Committee Chair\u00b7 Congressman Bobby Scott, Education and Labor Committee Chair\u00b7 Congressman Frank Pallone, Energy and Commerce Committee Chair\u00b7 Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Financial Services Committee Chair\u00b7 Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, Oversight and Reform Committee Chair\u00b7 Congresswoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, Small Business Committee Chair\u00b7 Congressman Mark Takano, Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Chair\u00b7 Congressman Richard Neal, Ways and Means Committee Chair\u00b7 Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, Appropriations Committee Chair\u00b7 Congressman Gregory Meeks, Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Advertisement\n Overall, the White House\u00a0invited 22 Democratic lawmakers - leadership and chairs of the relevant committees - to join the festivities.No Congressional Republicans were present, as no\u00a0GOP member of Congress crossed the aisle to vote in favor of the massive COVID-19\u00a0relief package.\u00a0\u00a0A number of Republicans at the state level were supportive of the package, but the White House has maintained strict COVID-19 protocols, so the footprint of the celebration was small.\u00a0First lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were also on hand.\u00a0\u00a0White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday morning on 'Good Morning America' that Biden will keep trying with Congressional Republicans, telling George Stephanopoulos, 'the door to the Oval Office remains open.'\u00a0Psaki said she believed Republicans might be willing to work with the Democratic White House on an infrastructure package and 'modernizing our immigration system.'\u00a0Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, GOP lawmakers are already setting their sights on taking back the House majority next year by using the influx of migrants at the southern border to hammer the White House on Biden's immigration policy.\u00a0'He's hopeful Republicans will join him,' Psaki said upon mentioning the two issue areas.\u00a0She also reacted to criticism of the legislation from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said that Democrats inherited a rising tide, and so the $1.9 trillion rescue plan didn't need to be so big.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Sen. Mitch McConnell and other Republicans are really outliers on this as you noted the majority of the American people support this package, including the majority of Republicans,' Psaki responded. 'So hopefully there'll be a moment of self-reflection for some of the members who voted against it.'\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who appeared on 'Morning Joe,' echoed Psaki's sentiment.\u00a0'It's not bipartisan in the Senate unfortunately, maybe the next bill will be because when Republicans see we can do it without them maybe they'll want to join us and do it with us, but it's bipartisan with the American people,' Schumer said.\u00a0\u00a0Public polling on the American Rescue Plan has shown that it's popular with both Democratic and Republican voters.\u00a0A Morning Consult poll conducted between March 6-8 found that 59 per cent of Republicans strongly or somewhat supported the COVID-19 relief package.\u00a0That's, of course, in comparison to 90 per cent of Democats who said the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The principles of the Biden administration: the president, vice president, first lady and second gentleman, will fan out throughout the country - mostly to swing states - starting next week to keep the legislative victory in the news.\u00a0Biden will kick off the American Rescue Plan Tour on Tuesday with a visit to Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the county tucked between his adopted hometown of Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he headquartered his 2020 campaign.\u00a0He'll also travel to Atlanta, Georgia Friday to promote the package.\u00a0In December and early January, Biden campaigned along with Georgia Democratic Senate hopefuls Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, promising voters in the state that if they won - which would give Democrats control of the Senate - Americans would see those $2,000 relief checks.\u00a0\u00a0The checks in the American Rescue Plan are $1,400 because $600 checks were included in the final COVID-19 stimulus package passed under former President Donald Trump.\u00a0Both Trump and Biden wanted the amount to be $2,000.",

        "title": "'A bad break': Kansas out of Big 12 tourney due to COVID-19",
        "full article": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - No. 11 Kansas withdrew from the Big 12 Tournament on Friday after a positive COVID-19 test within the men's basketball program, becoming the third major team to have its conference postseason end because of the coronavirus. The development, which sent No. 13 Texas into the championship game against No. 12 Oklahoma State, came only hours after No. 16 Virginia pulled out of an Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament semifinal because of a positive test. The Jayhawks learned earlier this week they would be without center David McCormack and backup forward Tristan Enaruna due to COVID-19 protocols. The tournament's second seed managed to squeak past No. 25 Oklahoma 69-62 in the quarterfinals without them Thursday night. Kansas had gone the entire season without an outbreak that caused it to cancel or postpone a game. \"Obviously we are disappointed and our players are disappointed that they can't continue to compete for the Big 12 championship,\" Jayhawks coach Bill Self said in a statement. \"We have followed daily testing and additional protocols that have been set up for us. Unfortunately we caught a bad break at the wrong time. '\"I look forward to preparing my team in probably a unique way for the NCAA Tournament,\" he said.          Kansas head coach Bill Self watches player introductions before an NCAA college basketball game against Oklahoma in the quarterfinal round of the Big 12 men's tournament in Kansas City, Mo., Thursday, March 11, 2021. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner)  It's unclear whether the positive test came from a player or staff member. Kansas would need to return seven consecutive days of negative tests that produce at least five eligible players to participate in the first round of the tournament. It opens March 19 - just a week away - and will be played entirely in Indianapolis and the surrounding area. The team remained in Kansas City and planned to practice with its eligible players this weekend before departing for the Indianapolis on Monday. McCormack, Enaruna and the player that tested positive Friday will not travel with the team, but McCormack and Enaruna are expected to join the Jayhawks before they play their first-round game. The player that tested positive during the Big 12 Tournament will likely miss the opening weekend of the NCAA tourney. At least the Jayhawks - they hope - get to play in the tournament. They were the likely No. 1 overall seed and had national championship aspirations before last season's NCAA Tournament was called off by the pandemic. It remained to be seen whether Oklahoma will return a positive test as a result of playing the Jayhawks. The Sooners have tested daily leading up to their trip to Kansas City and will continue prior to leaving for Indianapolis. On Thursday, perennial power Duke pulled out of the ACC Tournament after a pair of wins because of a positive test. The Blue Devils called off their season, cementing an end to their streak of 24 consecutive NCAA tourney appearances. A day later, defending national champion Virginia also bowed out of the ACC Tournament in what Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett called a \"gut punch.\" Several smaller schools, including Florida International and North Carolina A&T, also have withdrawn from conference tournaments this week. \"I\u00b4m hurting for our players, especially our seniors,\" Bennett said in a statement. \"We are exhausting all options to participate in the NCAA Tournament.\" The NCAA has put contingency plans in place should a team be unable to participate in its tournament beginning next week in Indiana. The last four at-large teams missing the field will be designated as replacement teams and put in the bracket in place of any team from a multi-bid conference that withdraws before their opening game. Once games begin, though, there will be no replacements and the opponent will automatically advance to the next round. ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/College-basketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25          Oklahoma guard De'Vion Harmon (11) is called for traveling while covered by Kansas guard Marcus Garrett (0) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in the quarterfinal round of the Big 12 men's tournament in Kansas City, Mo., Thursday, March 11, 2021.

(AP) - Brice Calip scored 12 of her 17 points in the first half, and Abby Hipp added 11 points as No. 21 Missouri State beat Southern Illinois 70-59 on Friday in the quarterfinals of the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament. The Lady Bears (21-2) are the No. 1 seed in the MVC tourney for the 12th time - after going undefeated in league play for the first time in program history. Elle Ruffridge chipped in with 10 points and Jasmine Franklin, the defensive player of the year, had seven points and three steals for Missouri State, which plays in the semifinals on Saturday. The Lady Bears held a 32-21 rebounding advantage and 38-24 for points in the paint. Missouri State closed the third quarter on a 9-0 run, making 8-of-10 shots in the period, to lead 50-40.

        "title": "Mexico president wants probe of judge who blocked power plan",
        "full article": "MEXICO CITY (AP) - Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador demanded an investigation Friday into judges who have temporarily blocked the implementation of his plan to favor older, dirtier government power plants over renewable and gas-fired facilities built in many cases by foreign firms. L\u00f3pez Obrador has said in the past that he would always respect the judicial branch, but on Friday he practically accused judges of being in the pay of private energy companies. \"We want the Judiciary (council) of the federal courts to review the actions of these judges, because it would be outrageous if the country's judicial branch were to be at the service of the private sector,\" the president said. In response, the National Association of Federal Circuit Court and District Judges wrote \"our only commitment is to the Constitution and (our) independence to guarantee the rule of law.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador also vowed to take the battle to Mexico\u00b4s Supreme Court, though he faces likely defeat there. On Friday he acknowledged he had not attempted to overturn a 2013 energy reform or Constitutional guarantees of competition in the electricity industry. The constitutional guarantees were part of what led the judge Thursday to grant an injunction blocking the new law, and the president's appeal is likely to founder on the same point. L\u00f3pez Obrador's new law, which took effect Tuesday, says electricity must first be bought from government-owned generating plants, which largely run on fossil fuels like coal, oil and diesel. If any demand remains, power will be purchased from renewable and private natural gas-fired plants. That has drawn complaints from investors, many of them foreign, who say it violates the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade pact and Mexico\u00b4s commitments to cut carbon emissions. They claim it also creates a de-facto government monopoly, hurts competition and will make Mexicans buy dirtier, more expensive electricity. L\u00f3pez Obrador suggested Friday he was willing to negotiate with the foreign companies if they accept less lucrative contracts. That is something he did once before, when he threatened to cancel contracts for natural gas pipelines to feed power stations unless the companies that built them agreed to changes in their contracts. L\u00f3pez Obrador has said the law is meant protect government-owned fossil-fuel plants against what he call unfair competition from private wind, solar and natural gas-fired power plants. \"We are open to seeking a dialogue, a negotiation,\" the president said. \"We are seeking to eliminate the worst points, the most damaging ones. And the companies can continue to do business, but with reasonable profits, but without coming here to steal. Let them go somewhere else to steal.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador has complained in the past that the private renewable and gas power plants got unfair preference over the state-owned electrical power company, were guaranteed high prices for their power and weren't required to contribute to building transmission lines to distribute electricity. But the issue came to a head when electricity use plunged during the pandemic. As a result, the state-owned power company, the Federal Electricity Commission, faced declining revenue and increasing stocks of fuel oil it has to burn even as the dirty fuel has lost customers worldwide. The commission also has come under pressure to buy coal from domestic mines. Many wind, solar and gas-fired power stations were built in Mexico by foreign companies following the previous administration\u00b4s 2013 energy reform that L\u00f3pez Obrador opposed. The president is a strong supporter of state-owned enterprises and fossils fuels. L\u00f3pez Obrador has also taken an increasingly nationalistic stance in recent months, saying foreign energy companies should \"go steal somewhere else\" and decrying feminist criticism of his administration as \"imported concepts.\" The new law has drawn complaints from private business groups and U.S. investors, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce saying in February the law \"would directly contravene Mexico\u00b4s commitments\" under the trade agreement, known as the USMCA, which places strict limits on how much a government can favor its own firms over outsiders. L\u00f3pez Obrador argues that Mexico should become energy self-sufficient, a conviction he says was strengthened after winter storms in Texas temporarily cut off supplies of imported natural gas early this year.",

        "full article": "No. 11 Kansas was forced to withdraw from the Big 12 tournament in Kansas City, Mo., on Friday following a positive COVID-19 test. Friday night's semifinal between the second-seeded Jayhawks (20-8) and third-seeded Texas was canceled, with the No. 13 Longhorns (18-7) advancing to Saturday's title game against Baylor or Oklahoma State. \"The cancellation follows a positive test, subsequent quarantining, and contact tracing within the Kansas men's basketball program,\" the Big 12 said in a statement. The Jayhawks' status for next week's NCAA Tournament is now unclear due to quarantine rules -- jeopardizing the nation's longest active streak of appearances. Kansas has appeared in each of the past 30 tourneys. All Tier 1 participants on every team -- players, coaches and members of the traveling party -- must exhibit seven negative COVID-19 tests before arriving in Indianapolis for the NCAA Tournament. Virginia and Duke are in a similar situation in the ACC after positive COVID-19 tests forced both schools to pull out of the conference tournament in Greensboro, N.C. Head coach Bill Self said the Jayhawks will continue their preparations for the Big Dance. \"Obviously we are disappointed and our players are disappointed that they can't continue to compete for the Big 12 championship,\" Self said in a statement. \"While we have been fortunate to avoid this throughout the season, there are daily risks with this virus that everybody participating is trying to avoid. \"We have followed the daily testing and additional protocols that have been setup for us, unfortunately we caught a bad break at the wrong time. I look forward to preparing my team in probably a unique way for next week's NCAA Tournament.\" Two Kansas players, big men David McCormack and Tristan Enaruna, did not travel with the team to Kansas City due to COVID-19 protocols. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "The Columbus Blue Jackets are trying to stay positive in the face of a three-game losing streak as they prepare to begin a two-game series against the visiting Dallas Stars on Saturday. Their most recent loss came Thursday at home, giving up a 4-1 lead in the third period to lose 5-4 in overtime to the Florida Panthers. Max Domi, who had a goal and an assist in the loss, said the Blue Jackets are staying positive even though they've recorded only two wins in their past 10 games. \"We have a great group in here,\" the 26-year-old center said. \"We have to believe in each other and believe in ourselves and go out and get a win and then just go from there. We'll take the point tonight and the positives that came with it, and we'll go on to the next one.\" Domi's assist on Oliver Bjorkstand's goal to open the scoring against the Panthers was his first point in 10 games. Patrik Laine also ended a seven-game point drought with a goal and an assist, while Elvis Merzlikins made 27 saves after missing eight games with a shoulder injury. It could be the start of something, Domi said. \"When you have the puck on your stick and you make plays, that's how you build confidence, right?\" Domi said. Head coach John Tortorella echoed the idea of building confidence, despite game statistics that don't bear out in the Blue Jackets' favor. The Blue Jackets committed 21 giveaways and won only 34 percent of their faceoffs. \"We just have to keep on growing each game,\" Tortorella said. \"Although we don't get a full result tonight, we get a point. ... There are so many good things happening, as far as breaking out of our end zone, and a lot of good things going on. We have to focus on that.\" On Saturday, the Blue Jackets host another struggling team in the Stars. When they last met exactly one week ago, the Stars stomped the Blue Jackets 5-0. The Stars are coming off a 4-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on Thursday, after trouncing the same team 6-1 on Tuesday. Anton Khudobin allowed four goals on eight shots and was replaced by Jake Oettinger in the third period. The Stars were 0-for-5 on the power play, including a 35-second 5-on-3 opportunity in the second period. They were 3-for-5 on the penalty kill. \"The power play was awful, the penalty kill wasn't good enough,\" Dallas coach Rick Bowness said. \"When you're off like that, you would hope your power play would get you a goal to get you going. It didn't happen tonight.\" On the bright side, Roope Hintz scored for the third straight game and John Klingberg had a highlight-reel goal, skating the length of the ice and ripping a shot from the slot past Blackhawks goalie Kevin Lankinen. The Stars outshot and outhit the Blackhawks, 30-16 and 25-15, respectively. They also won 54 percent of the faceoffs. The work ethic is there, Stars forward Blake Comeau said. \"We've just got to stick with it,\" he said. \"We're not giving up a whole lot, to be honest with you. That was the case tonight. It seemed like they'd shoot it, and it would go in. We had some great looks, some pucks that just didn't seem to find the way in the first two periods and we were down trying to chase the game in the third.\" --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's prime-time address on the fight against COVID-19 attracted more broadcast television viewers on Thursday than former President Donald Trump's first speech to the nation, according to preliminary ratings data. Roughly 18.2 million people watched Biden's speech on U.S. broadcast networks ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, Hollywood publications Deadline and The Wrap reported on Friday. The speech was delivered just hours after Biden signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law, and came on his 50th day in office.. Trump's first televised address to the country occurred in August 2017 -- seven months after he took office -- when he spoke about the war in Afghanistan. That event attracted 17.7 million viewers on the four broadcast networks. Updated figures that include cable TV viewership were expected to be released later on Friday.

        "full article": "By Diane Bartz WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Lawmakers heard testimony on Friday over whether a bill aimed at helping news outlets negotiate with tech platforms was an appropriate way to help the struggling industry, including discussion of whether it should be restricted to smaller news organizations. Representative David Cicilline, chair of the House Judiciary Committee antitrust panel, said his bill to allow a broad array of news organizations to collectively negotiate with Alphabet's Google and Facebook in hopes of recouping ad revenues would be a \"temporary solution to an urgent problem.\" His bill and a Senate companion were introduced on Wednesday. Republican Representative Jim Jordan has been critical of the big tech platforms, but also seemed skeptical of the bill. \"Maybe that's the right course, but I got real questions about that,\" he said. Representative Val Demings asked for reassurance that smaller publications would genuinely benefit from the legislation. Critics have expressed concern that joint negotiations with the platforms would strengthen the richest, most powerful media outlets and leave struggling smaller publications behind. But David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, argued that removing the bigger organizations, like the Wall Street Journal or Washington Post from the legislation, would make it less likely that joint negotiations would succeed. \"The collective action primarily benefits those who don't have a way to assert their value,\" said Chavern. \"Without the big publishers, the small ones have no hope.\" If it becomes law, the legislation creates a four-year antitrust exemption that would benefit any print, broadcast, or digital news organization with a dedicated editorial staff that publishes at least weekly. At least 25% of their output should be original. In addition to this measure, Cicilline has said he plans to introduce a series of bills aimed at toughening antitrust laws. (Reporting by Diane Bartz.

I knew it would be far easier to smile for the brief moment it takes to snap a picture than to challenge one of the most powerful men in the country.'\u00a0In an earlier 2012 incident while she was working for USA Today, Bakeman also claims that Cuomo kept her pinned to his side as he told a story to her male colleagues.\u00a0'He left it there, and kept me pinned next to him, for several minutes as he finished telling his story,' she said.\u00a0'I stood there, my cheeks hot, giggling nervously as my male colleagues did the same. We all knew it was wrong, but we did nothing.'The reporter, who now works in Florida, claimed that Cuomo 'never let me forget I was a woman' as she also alleged that he made frequent attempts to humiliate her, including calling out her purple phone instead of answering her question during a press gaggle.\u00a0         Governor Cuomo (pictured) continued to resist calls for him to resign on Friday        What happens if Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigns from office?\u00a0           If Cuomo resigns Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul (pictured) would take overAs of Friday afternoon, 14 out of 19 of New York's congressional Democrats have called for Governor Andrew Cuomo's resignation.They are joined by all Democrats in the NY State Senate and by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\u00a0Cuomo on Friday refused to accept that he should resign despite the mounting pressure.If he resigns\u00a0Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul would take over.\u00a0She would finish Cuomo\u2019s term until the next scheduled gubernatorial election in 2022.\u00a0Hochul is a Democrat who has served since 2015 and was a NY representative\u00a0for New York's 26th congressional district from 2011 to 2013.She backed an investigation into allegations against Cuomo last month.\u00a0'Everyone deserves to have their voice heard and to be taken seriously. I support an independent review,' she said.\u00a0The last time a governor resigned was in early 2008.\u00a0Gov. Eliot Spitzer left office after he admitted to having extramarital affairs with sex workers.\u00a0When Spitzer stepped down,\u00a0Lieutenant Governor David Paterson took over until 2010.\u00a0Cuomo, then Attorney General, won that election to take over from Paterson.\u00a0To date, a\u00a0lieutenant governor has stepped in to carry out a gubernatorial term in New York on eight occassions, the first one taking place in 1817.\u00a0LG Hochul would also take over if Cuomo is impeached.\u00a0\u00a0New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie authorized its Judiciary Committee to start an impeachment investigation into Cuomo Thursday.\u00a0The last time a NY governor was impeached was in 1913.\u00a0The process in New York is very similar to the impeachment procedure in Congress.\u00a0A simple majority in the state Assembly is required to impeach a governor.\u00a0It then goes to the state impeachment court.\u00a0A two-thirds majority of the state Senate and the justices of the New York Court of Appeals would be required to convict Cuomo and remove him from office.\u00a0The lieutenant governor takes over as acting governor while the trial plays out.

With him, these exchanges were always meant to be a public humiliation,' she said.\u00a0Yet, Bakeman also claimed that she did not believe Cuomo ever wanted to have sex with her, and that it was instead about 'power'.\u00a0'He wanted me to know that he could take my dignity away at any moment with an inappropriate comment or a hand on my waist,' she states.\u00a0'He wanted me to know that I was powerless, that I was small and weak, that I did not deserve what relative power I had: a platform to hold him accountable for his words and actions.\u00a0'He wanted me to know that he could take my dignity away at any moment with an inappropriate comment or a hand on my waist.'\u00a0'The way he bullies and demeans women is different. He uses touching and sexual innuendo to stoke fear in us. That is the textbook definition of sexual harassment,' she added.\u00a0\u00a0Cuomo's fourth accuser, Ana Liss, 35, also spoke to New York Magazine as she revealed how her treatment in the office led her to believe 'I was going crazy'.\u00a0Liss said that she 'started pursuing mental-health services when I was there because I thought I was going crazy. My parents thought I was going nuts'.'I was angry and crying all the time, and I went on Lexapro,' she added. 'I did call in to a suicide hotline because I felt like such a friggin' nobody.'She had previously told the Wall Street Journal that she had started drinking heavily while working with Cuomo's administration before asking to be moved to another office.And she revealed on Thursday that she was among the former aides to receive an allegedly intimidating phone call from top Cuomo aides in December after first accuser Lindsey Boylan came forward.In her first claims earlier this month she said that the governor asked her if she had a boyfriend, touched her on the lower back during an event reception and kissed her on the hand before she asked to move from his office.\u00a0'I felt gross, like I was just an ornament,' Liss said of requests for her to dress up while in the office.She added that had 'never felt more depleted by the male gaze'.'Melissa DeRosa [Cuomo's top aide] had Louboutins, and there were legs everywhere, and I just felt stupid,' Liss said.'I was living in a place that was full of people who were mean and predatory. It ground me down to the lowest point of my life, like I was a piece of nothing and my career was going nowhere.'State legislator Alessandra Biaggi also claimed in her conversation with New York Magazine that the governor kissed her head in front on her fianc\u00e9 twice when they met at a wedding after she left his office.She claims Cuomo asked, 'are you jealous?' while looking at her fianc\u00e9.'I didn't feel sexually harassed. I felt like he was trying to make me feel uncomfortable, to disarm me,' Biaggi claimed.Biaggi had also worked for Cuomo and that his comment to her at a 2016\u00a0party at the governor's mansion just weeks after she joined his office were also inappropriate .She claimed that he grabbed her by the elbow and said 'nice dance moves' rather than welcoming her into the fold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cuomo also received accusations of 'racialized abuse' by Camonghne Felix, who was his first black speech writer.She told New York that she eventually moved to the press team after she accepted he was never going to use her speeches.                Cuomo's fourth accuser, Ana Liss, 35, (pictured above) also spoke to New York Magazine as she revealed how her treatment in the office led her to believe 'I was going crazy'         'It's a very subtle form of racialized abuse,'\u00a0Camonghne Felix has said of Cuomo's office'It's a very subtle form of racialized abuse,' she said. 'You know I am beneficial to you. I fill a quota. It looks good on paper, and we made sure to put press releases out. But you don't intend to incorporate me into the government. You just like to show me to people.''I probably wrote about 30 speeches or sets of remarks for him, and I think he used one,' Felix said of the time in his administration, which she joined in 2015 as a 23-year-old.\u00a0'My desk was close to his office. He loved to see me, but he didn't listen to a single word I ever said.'Other women reiterated previous claims that they were expected to wear nice dresses and high heels in the office, with some saying they were contacted about interviewing for the governor's administration after he met them at parties.'We all knew that this was only because of what I looked like,' one former aide known only as Kaitlin said of her call.\u00a0         State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi has been among the state lawmakers calling for Cuomo's resignation'Why else would you ask someone to come in two days after you had a two-minute interaction at a party?'\u00a0Kaitlin said that she first met Cuomo while working at a fundraiser in 2016 and that he grabbed her into a 'kind of dance pose' as a photographer took their picture.\u00a0'This is the weirdest interaction I've ever had in my life. I was like, Don't touch me. Everybody was watching,' she remembers thinking.\u00a0She added that she had never handed over her contact information to Cuomo's office but still received a call the following week about coming to work for him.\u00a0Kaitlin had been working as a waitress while carrying out a 9-5 with a Democratic congressman before being offered a position at a\u00a0lobbying firm that allowed her to cut back to waitressing just weekends.\u00a0She was offered the role with Cuomo just weeks after starting at the lobbying firm but was among those who felt the pressure to dress expensively and to always look done up.\u00a0'I did what I could with my clothes,' she said, 'and it wasn't good enough for them.'\u00a0She claimed that if Cuomo came into the office early it would give her less time to get ready and he would berate her with questions like 'decided not to get ready today?''I'd think, You're such an a*****e; you know you left early so I didn't have time,' Kaitlin said, claiming that she was given very little direction once she joined the administration but was simply told to be 'a sponge' to learn from more senior women.\u00a0Cuomo's team has denied that women were ever pressured on the way they dressed or to wear high heels.\u00a0\u00a0One former staffer claimed that there was a link between Cuomo's treatment of women and the nursing home scandal.\u00a0'The same attitude that emboldens you to target a 25-year-old also emboldens you to scrub a nursing-home report,' she said.\u00a0Others have also claimed that policy came second over the governor's public appearances.\u00a0'It was policy-making like paint-by-\u00adnumbers,' one former staffer said. 'The goal was superficial, as opposed to changing people's lives.'\u00a0'Someone from the inner circle would call and say, \"The governor wants to go to Orange County. What can we announce?\"'\u00a0she added.\u00a0Joel Wertheimer told New York that when he first joined Cuomo's office in 2017, he was invited to a party where the governor's staff laughed at the fact that\u00a0Melissa DeRosa, now secretary to the governor, did not know the names of many state officials.\u00a0Wertheimer left the office after seven months stating: 'It\u2019s this total toxic masculine bullshit that disguises a very poorly run place.'The accusations of bullying come on the back of claims by state assemblyman Ron Kim of Cuomo threatening to 'destroy' him over Kim's comments on the nursing home scandal to the press.And after accuser Boylan also revealed in her February Medium post about her allegations that 'parts of a supposed confidential personnel file' from her time with the Cuomo administration were sent to the press in what she claimed was an effort to smear her.\u00a0\u00a0         A protestor sits outside the New York State Capitol on Friday, following allegations that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had sexually harassed young women         A group also gathered to protest over the nursing home COVID scandal (pictured)On Friday, Cuomo refused to resign and claimed that he won't bow to 'cancel culture'.\u00a0With a sprawling coalition of congressional leaders joining dozens of state lawmakers in calling for the embattled governor to step down, the Democrat hit back.\u00a0Cuomo accused those who are calling for him to step down of 'playing politics', and said that as a former Attorney General, he knows that people 'allege all sorts of things, for all sorts of reasons.'The current New York Attorney General Letitia James is currently investigating Cuomo over the women's complaints and over his handling of the data regarding nursing home deaths from COVID-19.\u00a0The new calls for his resignation come a day after New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said he had authorized its Judiciary Committee to start an impeachment investigation into sexual misconduct allegations that six women have made against Cuomo.\u00a0The panel's investigation will run parallel to one being led by AG Letitia James.\u00a0The mounting scandals have also left Cuomo in a weakened position during negotiations over the state budget, which is due on April 1.\u00a0Cuomo has asked the public to await the results of that investigation before making a judgment.The third-term governor, who took office in 2011, has pointed to his reelections as indication of strong statewide support, which was bolstered last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0He also touted his administration's passage of liberal goals such as same-sex marriage as evidence that his hard-nosed approach to politics works.\u00a0Cuomo is due to run for election again in 2022.",

From a few words deciphered on the twisted, corroded fragments of bronze gears and plates, experts guessed the relic was an astronomical instrument.But much more remained hidden out of sight.\u00a0After more than a decade's efforts using cutting-edge scanning equipment, an international team of scientists has now read about 3,500 characters of explanatory text - a quarter of the original - in the innards of the 2,100-year-old remains.\u00a0They say it was a kind of philosopher's guide to the galaxy, and perhaps the world's oldest mechanical computer. Advertisement\n And this is what help the UCL team reconstruct the device.\u00a0Two critical numbers in the X-rays of the front cover, of 462 years and 442 years, accurately represent cycles of Venus and Saturn.\u00a0When observed from Earth, the planets' cycles sometimes reverse their motions against the stars and the variable cycles must be tracked over a long period in order to accurately predict their positions.\u00a0Ph.D. candidate and UCL Antikythera Research Team member Aris Dacanalis, said: 'The classic astronomy of the first millennium BC originated in Babylon, but nothing in this astronomy suggested how the ancient Greeks found the highly accurate 462-year cycle for Venus and 442-year cycle for Saturn.'Using an ancient Greek mathematical method described by the philosopher Parmenides, the UCL team not only explained how the cycles for Venus and Saturn were derived but also managed to recover the cycles of all the other planets, where the evidence was missing.Ph.D. candidate and team member David Higgon explained: 'After considerable struggle, we managed to match the evidence in Fragments A and D to a mechanism for Venus, which exactly models its 462-year planetary period relation, with the 63-tooth gear playing a crucial role.'Professor Freeth added: 'The team then created innovative mechanisms for all of the planets that would calculate the new advanced astronomical cycles and minimize the number of gears in the whole system, so that they would fit into the tight spaces available.'         The Antikythera Mechanism was named after the southern Greek island off which it was found, in a mid-1st century BC shipwreck, discovered first in\u00a01901 in the Aegean Sea. Location of the shipwreck picturedNow that the team has an idea how the Mechanism was constructed, the next step is to 'prove\u00a0its feasibility by making it with ancient techniques,'\u00a0added co-author, Dr. Adam Wojcik (UCL Mechanical Engineering).'A particular challenge will be the system of nested tubes that carried the astronomical outputs,' he continued.",

        "title": "Kenyan police believe man who shot 2 dead was an extremist",
        "full article": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Kenya's head of criminal investigations said Friday that police now believe that a man who grabbed a gun from a police officer and shot randomly at people a week ago, killing two and seriously wounding six, is likely an Islamic extremist. The incident occurred in Kenya's third largest city, Kisumu, on the shores of Lake Victoria, that has never experienced an extremist attack. Circulating CCTV close-ups of the man, George Kinoti asked the public to help identify the assailant, who was later killed by a mob when he ran out of bullets, as police have been unable to trace his background. No one has come to claim the man's body, he said. Kinoti said detectives, working with the anti-terrorism unit, \"have reasons to believe that the assailant was not just the ordinary criminal, but prior to the attack received training in tactical maneuvers and weapon handling.\" \"Given our experience, our preliminary conclusion (is that) he is an Islamic extremist. We want to know if he was alone or there is a cell or network remaining, we urge for public support to identify him,\" Kinoti told the Associated Press. Three identification cards found on the man belonged to three different people who do not know the assailant, he said. According to a police report the man, wearing gloves and a hood overpowered a police officer, grabbed his gun and shot him. No group has claimed responsibility for the shooting, but since 2011 Kenya has experienced numerous terrorist attacks from the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab group that is based in Somalia. Al-Shabab has recruited most of its foreign fighters from Kenya, which has a large ethnic Somali presence, as well as from other tribes. If police establish a connection between the assailant and al-Shabab it will be the first Islamic extremist attack on a major city since al-Shabab's January 15 2019 raid on an office complex in Nairobi that killed 21 people. Al-Shabab has vowed retribution on Kenya for sending troops to Somalia in 2011 to fight the militants who are trying to topple the government and establish an Islamic state. More recently the group's attacks have focused on five counties in Kenya that border Somalia.",

        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - Two tests were positive for COVID-19, both among players, during 14,704 samples collected in the past week under Major League Baseball's monitoring program. That comes to a positive rate of 0.01%, Cincinnati first baseman Joey Votto had tested positive, the Reds said Wednesday. There have been 12 positive tests - nine for players, three for staff, among 43,928 monitoring tests during spring training, a rate of 0.3%, the commissioner's office said Friday. The positive tests were among nine of the 30 teams. Including intake testing upon arrival at spring training, there have been 27 positive tests - 21 players, six staff - among 49,281 tests, a positive rate of 0.5%. The positive tests were among 17 teams. All players on 40-man rosters and players with minor league contracts invited to big league training camp are screened. Also tested are all other on-field personnel such as managers, coaches and athletic trainers, strength and conditioning staff and physicians. In the final figures released last year, MLB said it had collected 172,740 samples and that 91 had been positive, or 0.05%. Fifty-seven of 91 positives were players, and 21 of the 30 teams have had a person covered by the monitoring test positive. There were 45 regular-season games postponed for virus-related reasons last year but just two were not made up, between St. Louis and Detroit. ___ More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "title": "COVID-19 deaths falling but Americans 'must remain vigilant'",
        "full article": "NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. deaths from COVID-19 are falling again as the nation continues to recover from the devastating winter surge, a trend that experts are cautiously hopeful will accelerate as more vulnerable people are vaccinated. While new coronavirus infections and hospitalizations have plummeted, the decline in deaths from a January peak of about 4,500 hasn't been quite as steep. But, now, after weeks of hovering around 2,000 daily deaths, that figure has dropped to about 1,400 U.S. lives lost each day to coronavirus. \"I am encouraged by these data but we must remain vigilant,\" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at Friday's White House briefing. Public health experts say it's too soon to say, definitively, what\u00b4s driving declines since the surge - but they suspect a post-holiday drop in traveling and indoor gatherings, widespread mask wearing and the vaccine rollout have all contributed. \"We\u00b4re moving in the right direction,\" said Harvard Medical School researcher Jagpreet Chhatwal. \"I think a message of optimism is fair.\" Walensky and others worry that a pandemic-weary public will let down its guard too soon. And they're monitoring the spread of worrisome new versions of the virus.          FILE - In this Nov. 19, 2020, file photo, ventilator tubes are attached to a COVID-19 patient at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in the Mission Hills section of Los Angeles. U.S. deaths from COVID-19 are falling again as the nation recovers from the devastating winter surge. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)  \"We\u00b4re all desperate to get done with this,\" said Jeff Shaman, who studies infectious disease at Columbia University. \"We\u00b4re not in a place where it\u00b4s safe as of yet.\" Health care workers say they've seen it happen before - a crushing wave of illness and death, momentary relief from a drop in COVID-19 cases, and then, another deadly surge. About 531,000 Americans have died since the pandemic began a year ago. \"Every time you thought you had an end, the number of cases went up,\" said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, head of emergency medicine at St. Joseph\u00b4s Health in Paterson, New Jersey. For now, most forecasts show coronavirus deaths falling further in coming weeks as more people get vaccines. More than 100 million doses have been given out since December, and the pace is picking up. \"We expect it to continue to drive those deaths down even more,\" said Johns Hopkins infectious disease expert Justin Lessler. As of this week, 62% of those 65 and older have gotten at least one dose, according to the CDC. That's the age group that's been hit the hardest and still accounts for the vast majority of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. Increasingly better treatments for severe COVID-19 will also continue to help, doctors say. \"All of these things are coming together to put a dent in the problem,\" said Dr. Lewis Nelson, an emergency medicine specialist at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. The tally of coronavirus deaths often lags behind new infections and hospitalizations, since it can take a long time for someone to become seriously ill and die after contracting the virus. It can also take weeks for deaths to be added to the national count. \"There\u00b4s sort of a longer tail, sadly, on death and dying from COVID-19,\" said Boston College public health expert Dr, Philip J. Landrigan. That's what happened in the case of Teresa Ciappa, 73, of Amherst, New York, who developed a terrible cough and fever around Thanksgiving. She was admitted to the hospital soon after and died in early January of complications from COVID-19. \"Week after week she just declined and declined,\" said her daughter, Michelle Ciappa, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. Her family was there when she was taken off of a ventilator. \"We watched her take her last breath and that was it,\" Michelle Ciappa said. \"I wish people would be patient and take this more seriously.\" If states continue lifting restrictions, health experts warn, we could see another deadly wave of illnesses. On Monday, Wyoming became the latest state in a growing list - including Texas, Mississippi, North Dakota, Iowa, Montana and Alabama - that has pulled mask requirements or plan to do so soon. Governors across the country have also eased restrictions on how many customers can be allowed in bars, restaurants, gyms and movie theaters. \"They\u00b4re not taking a slow measured approach. They\u00b4re flipping a switch,\" Lessler said. \"There is the very real possibility of big resurgences.\" Experts also worry about unchecked spread of mutated versions of the coronavirus that spread easier and could blunt the effectiveness of certain treatments or vaccines. \"It\u00b4s still a race against time,\" said Jaline Gerardin, who studies COVID-19 trends at Northwestern University. \"The fear is we won\u00b4t catch something when we should.\" Rosenberg, the ER doctor, said he hopes the public will be encouraged by the pandemic's downward trend to keep wearing masks, washing their hands and staying a safe distance from others. \"We know what worked,\" he said. \"If we\u00b4re saying we\u00b4re in the last phase of the battle, don\u00b4t put your weapons away yet.\" ___ AP writers Thalia Beaty in New York and John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u00b4s Department of Science Education.

        "title": "Bolivia ex-President Anez behind bars, alleges persecution over coup claims",
        "full article": "By Daniel Ramos and Monica Machicao LA PAZ, March 13 (Reuters) - Bolivia's former interim President Jeanine Anez landed behind bars on Saturday in the capital of the country she led just six months ago after the new government arrested her on claims she participated in a 2019 coup to seize power. Anez and a raft of ministers and security officials face charges of terrorism, sedition and conspiracy over an alleged coup against Bolivia's 13-year socialist government, according to an arrest warrant she posted on social media. Anez led Bolivia for less than a year after long-time President Evo Morales left office following contested elections and violent protests. The crackdown escalates hostilities between the current socialist administration of Morales' political ally and successor President Luis Arce, and more conservative opponents it accuses of ousting Morales. Hours after a dawn raid on Anez's home in the central city of Trinidad, she was pictured behind bars in a women's holding cell in La Paz awaiting a judicial hearing due to take place within 24 hours. She claimed to be the victim of \"aberrant political persecution\" and said she should benefit from immunity as a former president. In letters to the Organization of American States and the European Union, Anez appealed for observer missions to evaluate her arrest and those of her former energy and justice ministers. \"It is an absolute outrage, they are accusing us of being accomplices of an alleged coup,\" Anez told local television as she arrived in a military plane at a La Paz airport under heavy police escort. \"There is not a grain of truth in the accusations. It is simple political intimidation. There was no coup. I took part in a constitutional succession.\" Anez took power in late 2019 after Morales resigned amid widespread violent protests against his government over allegations he fraudulently won an election when running for an unprecedented and unconstitutional fourth term. At least 33 people were killed in violence that followed the election, 30 of them after Anez took office. Morales' Movement for Socialism party, now headed by Arce, his former economy minister, swept back to power in a landslide election last October, prompting Morales to return from exile in Argentina. Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo confirmed on Saturday that the Public Prosecutor's Office had detained Anez for involvement in a \"coup in our country.\" He insisted due process would be followed. \"There is no political persecution on our part here, and we do not fear anyone who thinks differently,\" he told a news conference. Justice Minister Ivan Lima told state TV the investigation against Anez related to the time she was an opposition senator, not the interim president. \"For that reason constitutional privileges do not apply,\" he said. Julie Chung, the U.S. State Department's acting assistant secretary for its Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, urged \"our friends and neighbors in Bolivia\" to uphold civil rights and guarantee detainees due process. \"Americans and many across the Americas know from hard experience the need to safeguard and constantly renew democratic rule of, by, and for the people,\" she tweeted. 'WE ARE ALL JEANINE' Luis Fernando Camacho, a lawyer and civic leader who became a powerful opposition figure and led protests against Morales in the 2019 election impasse, has also been named by prosecutors as wanted in relation to the alleged coup. Any attempt to detain Camacho, recently elected as governor of the wealthy, industrial city of Santa Cruz to the east, could provoke civil unrest. \"We are not going anywhere. This is my town, I am going to stay with the people who were in that fight ... to peacefully defeat the electoral fraud of Morales and MAS,\" he told reporters on Saturday evening. Other opposition leaders who ran against Arce in the last election also spoke out against the arrests. Carlos Mesa, a former president and candidate for the presidency in the 2019 election, told a press conference that Bolivia was flirting with Venezuelan-style autocracy. \"This is not a legal problem, this is a political problem,\" he said. Anez's former Interior Minister Arturo Murillo, who was also named in the arrest warrant but is thought to have left Bolivia following Arce's election, tweeted \"We Are All Jeanine.\" \"(Anez) gave her all for Bolivia, including her freedom,\" he wrote. The Americas director of Human Rights Watch, Jose Miguel Vivanco, said the arrest warrants contained no evidence to support a claim of \"terrorism.\" \"They generate justifiable doubts about whether this is not a politically motivated process,\" he added.

Soybean futures were narrowly mixed, caught between surging soyoil futures amid tightening world vegetable oil supplies, and slowing demand for soymeal, a hog feed ingredient. Corn prices were little changed ahead of the weekend. As of 1:03 p.m. CST (1903 GMT), Chicago Board of Trade May wheat was down 4-1/4 cents at $6.38-1/4 per bushel after dipping to $6.37-1/2, its lowest since Feb. 12. Wheat futures fell as a winter storm was expected to bring snow, rain and high winds through Sunday to the Rocky Mountains and Plains. Winter wheat should benefit from the moisture as the crop emerges from dormancy and begins its key growth phase. \"Wheat prices reflect expectations for improving weather here in the States, along with soft export demand and weak seasonal signals,\" Arlan Suderman, StoneX chief commodities economist, said in a client note. CBOT May corn was up 1/2 cent at $5.39 a bushel. In the soy complex, May soybeans were up 1/2 cent at $14.14 a bushel while soyoil futures set life-of-contract highs and rival Malaysian palm oil futures hit a 13-year top. Meanwhile, CBOT May soymeal fell below its 100-day moving average, triggering sell-stops, on fears that disease outbreaks in China's huge hog herd will hurt demand for the feed ingredient. Soybean and corn futures were underpinned by uncertainty about the size of the harvests in South America, with dry conditions threatening Argentina's crops and wet weather slowing Brazil's soy harvest. \"We are still trying to get our arms around what is happening in Latin America,\" said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co in Chicago. The Buenos Aires Grains Exchange lowered its estimate of Argentina's soybean harvest to 44 million tonnes and its corn forecast to 45 million tonnes, below its previous forecasts of 46 million tonnes for each crop. But several forecasters have increased estimates for Brazil's ongoing soybean harvest, despite rain delays.

        "title": "Brady signs extension, frees salary cap space for Buccaneers",
        "full article": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Tom Brady has agreed to a contract extension with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that provides the Super Bowl champions with much-needed salary cap relief and will help the seven-time NFL champion reach a goal of playing until he\u00b4s at least 45. Brady posted a picture of himself on Twitter, signing the extension Friday with the message: \"In pursuit of 8 ... LFG@ Buccaneers we\u00b4re keeping the band together.\" The extension confirmed by the team frees about $19 million in salary cap space, a move that improves Tampa Bay\u00b4s chances of returning as much of its championship roster as possible for 2021. Seven starters from the Super Bowl were among two dozen Buccaneers eligible to become free agents next week. \"When we acquired Tom a year ago, we were extremely excited about the leadership, poise and winning track record that he would bring to our locker room. Since that time, he has proven himself to be the ultimate competitor and delivered in every way we had imagined, helping us capture the Lombardi Trophy,\" general manager Jason Licht said. \"Year after year,\" the GM added, \"Tom proves that he remains one of the elite quarterbacks in this game and we couldn\u00b4t be happier to keep him in Tampa Bay as we continue to pursue our goals together.\"          FILE - Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady leaves the field an NFL divisional round playoff football game against the New Orleans Saints in New Orleans, in this Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021, file photo. om Brady has agreed to a contract extension with the Buccaneers that provides the Super Bowl champions with much-needed salary cap relief and will help the seven-time NFL champion reach a goal of playing until he's at least 45. Brady posted a picture of himself on Twitter, signing the extension Friday, March 12, 2021, with the message: \"In pursuit of 8 ... LFG@ Buccaneers we're keeping the band together.\" (AP Photo/Brett Duke, File)  Brady's extension adds an extra season on the two-year, $50 million contract he signed in free agency last March following a 20-year run with the New England Patriots. The five-time Super Bowl MVP capped his first season with the Bucs by leading Tampa Bay to its first championship in 18 years. In preparation for the start of free agency next week, Licht placed the franchise tag on receiver Chris Godwin and signed linebacker Lavonte David to a two-year, $25 million contract that was announced Friday. David\u00b4s contract, of which $20 million is guaranteed, includes voidable years that make it salary cap friendly. Brady's extension also includes voidable years to provide cap relief this winter. \"Tom is one of those great guys who understands that it takes a whole village to win. It takes a team, a group of guys, to win football games,\" David said. \"Me, the same thing. I\u00b4m all about team,\" the linebacker, who\u00b4s played his entire nine-year career with the Bucs, added. \"I\u00b4m doing what I can and doing what it takes to hopefully get everybody back and go do this thing again.\" Tampa Bay was estimated to be more than $7 million over the salary cap before the 43-year-old Brady, who has said he wants to play until he's at least 45, extended his contract. With the quarterback\u00b4s help, the Bucs can now turn their attention to trying to reach a long-term deal with linebacker Shaquil Barrett, the 2019 NFL sack leader who earned $15.8 million last season while playing under the franchise tag. Tight end Rob Gronkowski, wide receiver Antonio Brown, defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh, running back Leonard Fournette and kicker Ryan Succop among the other free agents Licht and coach Bruce Arians hope to retain. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

        "full article": "Of the 11 teams that have tried and failed to beat Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea, from Manchester United to Liverpool to Atletico Madrid, Championship side Barnsley are the team who tested them the most.They managed 14 shots against Chelsea in the FA Cup \u2014 10 inside the box, four from outside \u2014 with a specific gameplan to press Tuchel\u2019s side high up the pitch.They blocked passes into the Chelsea midfield and so rigorous was their pressing, two of Barnsley\u2019s front three had to be replaced by fresh legs after an hour. It forced Chelsea into a back five with the Premier League visitors\u2019 wing-backs unable to get forward.

So effective were Barnsley that Chelsea had to make emergency changes at half-time. They ended up winning courtesy of their only shot on target \u2014 a second-half tap-in by Tammy Abraham.Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa, as a tactician who loves the little details, will no doubt be aware of how his Yorkshire neighbours made life difficult for the west Londoners in the FA Cup last month.Copying the high press of Valerien Ismael\u2019s Barnsley may well be your best bet of disrupting Chelsea\u2019s play and inflicting a first defeat on Tuchel.Another key factor at Oakwell was the poor state of the pitch, which didn\u2019t help Chelsea in their bid to play out from the back. The Elland Road pitch has not won any admirers this season either. Leeds reacted to the negativity by having their pitch relaid in January but it\u2019s still causing problems.Chelsea will have to cope with that on Saturday, too, and that could play into the hands of a high-press tactic.       Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa loves the little details and will likely be aware of Barnsley's effortsThe signature of Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea system has been to play with a back three and two midfield sitters. It makes the team compact and when in possession, the defenders can punch passes into the midfielders or find the wing-backs, who position themselves high and wide.When Everton failed to press Chelsea during their Monday night defeat at Stamford Bridge, Andreas Christensen \u2014 at the heart of the back three \u2014 had time to bring the ball out and assess his options. Chelsea were able to dictate possession from there.Mason Mount was rested but Callum Hudson-Odoi and Timo Werner played as inside forwards with the very effective Kai Havertz often moving deep into midfield to receive the ball in the build-up.Chelsea recorded another clean sheet against Everton and have only conceded two goals in Tuchel\u2019s 11 games.When under pressure, everybody gets behind the ball, bar one attacker. The wing-backs retreat to create a back five, with a protective shield sitting in front of the defence. Mateo Kovacic, Cesar Azpilicueta and Antonio Rudiger are the three outfield players to have made the most starts under Tuchel, which is intriguing given they weren\u2019t always in favour under Frank Lampard.Rudiger, in particular, looks a man on a mission to use this second chance to resurrect his Chelsea career.What has stood out to me when watching Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea is how much more aggressive they have become.         Antonio Rudiger (right) looks desperate to make the most of his second chance at ChelseaAll over the pitch, they are looking more tenacious, with the back three shutting the door much more aggressively than they were previously.They are winning more duels and getting good numbers around the ball.The statistics show there has been a huge swing in the goals conceded column when comparing Chelsea under Tuchel to Lampard \u2014 they\u2019re conceding 0.2 per game now compared to 0.9 previously \u2014 but also they are not scoring as freely.We\u2019re yet to see them truly let loose in attack because they\u2019ve been focusing on making themselves difficult to beat, first and foremost.Five of Tuchel\u2019s eight wins with Chelsea have been by a single goal, including four 1-0s, so they need to find a way to score more than they are.Set-pieces will be key on Saturday. Chelsea have scored the most goals from set plays in the Premier League this season while Leeds, who go man-for-man, have conceded the most.         Chelsea have become much more aggressive under Thomas Tuchel but less free-scoringSignificantly, after Monday\u2019s defeat at West Ham United, Bielsa publicly accepted the blame for the alarming amount of goals his side have been shipping from set-pieces.I\u2019m sure he will have been agonising over his long-held beliefs on man-marking from restarts. They even man-mark from throw-ins which, given there are 40 of those a game on average, can be used to drag you out of shape if your opponents are clever.Top coaches adapt and it will be intriguing to see if Bielsa changes things for the visit of Chelsea on Saturday.Leeds had two goals disallowed inside the first 10 minutes at the London Stadium but instead found themselves 2-0 down by half-time. That almost summed up their season. Both West Ham goals were avoidable.The opener was a result of centre back Liam Cooper playing an over-ambitious diagonal ball when they had multiple men forward. Leeds lost possession and suddenly the entire team had to turn and retreat.         Set pieces will be crucial - Chelsea have scored the most, while Leeds have conceded the mostRight back Luke Ayling ended up sprinting back and sticking out a tired leg on Jesse Lingard to concede a penalty.West Ham\u2019s second goal saw Craig Dawson easily lose his marker Diego Llorente and make a straight run to head home from a corner.This is why I\u2019d always recommend a combination of man-marking and zonal marking.If Leeds mark as flimsily as they did against West Ham, Chelsea could clean up.Tuchel has already got the better of Jurgen Klopp, Jose Mourinho, Diego Simeone and Carlo Ancelotti since taking charge in January, with none of their teams able to score against Chelsea.Bielsa\u2019s reputation as a coach is up there with all of those names. The Leeds boss will be determined to do what they couldn\u2019t and make a dent in Tuchel\u2019s defence today.

        "title": "Planned vigil for Sarah Everard hangs in the balance after High Court ruling",
        "full article": "A planned vigil for Sarah Everard hangs in the balance after a High Court judge refused to make a declaration regarding the right to gather for protest under coronavirus restrictions. Organisers of the proposed Reclaim These Streets event in south London on Saturday say the Metropolitan Police told them it could not go ahead due to lockdown rules. They brought urgent legal action on Friday, asking Mr Justice Holgate to make \u201can interim declaration\u201d that any ban on outdoor gatherings under coronavirus regulations is \u201csubject to the right to protest\u201d. But the judge declined to grant the group\u2019s request and also\u00a0refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the force of \u201cprohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances\u201d is unlawful. Reclaim These Streets was organised after the disappearance of Ms Everard, 33, whose body was formally identified by police on Friday, prompted a public outcry about women\u2019s safety. The event was due to take place at Clapham Common bandstand, close to where Ms Everard went missing, at 6pm on Saturday. At the outset of Friday\u2019s hearing, the judge said: \u201cAll of us appreciate the tragic circumstances in which this case has had to be brought and I am sure we all respect the particular sensitivities involved.\u201d In his ruling, he said the organisers were told by police that \u201cthe vigil would be illegal and that their \u2018hands were tied\u2019 by Covid-19 regulations\u201d. The judge added that the four claimants \u201cwere told that, as organisers, they would be liable to be issued with \u00a310,000 fixed penalty notices\u201d, and could also be arrested. Mr Justice Holgate said it would not be \u201cappropriate for the court\u201d to make the declaration sought. He ruled that \u201cthe requirements of the law have been clearly stated\u201d in previous court rulings, including a challenge to Covid-19 lockdown rules brought by businessman Simon Dolan, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in December. The judge also said: \u201cGiven what has happened at the hearing, it may well be that there will be further communication between the claimants and the solicitors they instruct and the police to deal with the application of the regulations and (the rights to freedom of expression and assembly) to this particular event.\u201d However, he added: \u201cThat is not a matter upon which the court should comment.\u201d The judge concluded: \u201cI decline to grant the interim relief sought. But I hope that, in this judgment, I have clarified the application of the law in so far as it is appropriate for me to do so at this stage.\u201d Lawyers representing the organisers earlier argued the Met\u2019s interpretation of the Covid-19 restrictions goes against human rights law. Mr Hickman told the court a risk assessment had been carried out, adding: \u201cIt is proposed to organise it in a responsible manner, in co-ordination with the council and the police. \u201cArrangements will be made to ensure that it is conducted in a Covid-secure manner.\u201d The barrister said the measures would include social distancing, wearing of masks and marshals. Mr Hickman told Mr Justice Holgate: \u201cThey (the Met) say that any gathering of people which constitutes a protest is prohibited by the regulations and it is not up to them, the police, to make an assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable. \u201cCritically, (they say) it is not up to them to make an assessment as to whether or not it is necessary as a legitimate exercise of individuals\u2019 rights under Article 10 and Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\u201d Article 10 protects the right to freedom of expression and Article 11 protects the right to freedom of assembly. George Thomas, representing the Met, said there is no \u201cblanket ban\u201d on protest as far as the force is concerned. He said: \u201cThe situation is that what is proposed here is a gathering of unlimited number and, given great and very understandable public concern and public interest in what has happened\u2026 it would not be at all surprising if the numbers were in the thousands.\u201d The barrister said this could lead to significant crowds in a central London location, at a time when Parliament\u2019s intention is to not allow gatherings of more than two people for health reasons amid the pandemic. Mr Thomas added: \u201cThe Metropolitan Police say that this is very clearly not an event that the regulations, on the face of it, permit and it is an event where it would plainly be proportionate for the police to impose restrictions on it.\u201d He also told the court: \u201cNothing I have said today should in any way be understood by anyone hearing today\u2019s proceedings as the Metropolitan Police doing anything other than taking extremely seriously the concerns that the public, many members of the public, have expressed. \u201cThe Metropolitan Police share the anger that many members of the public have about what has happened. \u201cIt has every sympathy with the underlying cause that those wishing to have the vigil tomorrow would seek to show. \u201cBut, in the context of the coronavirus crisis that the country is currently in, it would not be appropriate for the police to allow such a large-scale gathering to take place.\u201d The vigil, due to take place at Clapham Common bandstand, was organised after Ms Everard\u2019s suspected kidnap and murder sparked anger over the safety of women on the UK\u2019s streets. In written submissions to the court on behalf of the group, Mr Hickman said: \u201cThe vigil is to be held for Sarah Everard and for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from streets, or who face the fear of violence every day. \u201cIt is intended to raise awareness and provoke change in attitudes towards and understanding of the pervasiveness of threats faced by women. \u201cThe claimants wish to proceed with it now whilst what has happened to Ms Everard is at the forefront of their and other attendees\u2019 minds, as well as in those of the public nationally.\u201d Under the current Covid-19 lockdown in England, people are largely required to stay at home and can only gather in larger groups for limited reasons, such as funerals or for education. Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of \u00a310,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people.",

        "full article": "Jahvon Quinerly scored 14 points as Alabama flexed its depth on Friday afternoon during an 85-48 victory over Mississippi State in a Southeastern Conference tournament quarterfinal game in Nashville, Tenn. Quinerly led a solid performance by the Crimson Tide's reserves, who totaled 47 points -- almost equaling Mississippi State's overall output. Juwan Gary made all four of his shots and finished with 11 points and Keon Ellis had six points and seven rebounds. Sixth-ranked and top-seeded Alabama (22-6) advanced to Saturday's semifinal and is within two victories of claiming its first SEC tournament title in 30 years and seventh overall. The Crimson Tide won their fourth in a row and seventh in their past eight games. Alabama recorded its most lopsided victory of the season and its fourth win by 30 or more points. The Crimson Tide swept the three meetings against Mississippi State for the season. The previous two, however, were decided by eight points or fewer. Alabama broke Friday's game open in the first half with a 21-1 run over a seven-plus minute span during which it shot 8-for-23 from 3-point range. Alabama led by as many as 37 in the game and its 47-19 halftime lead was the largest in an SEC tournament game in 40 years. The Crimson Tide shot 48.5 percent overall and made 13-of-36 attempts from 3-point range while committing only nine turnovers. Iverson Molinar led ninth-seeded Mississippi State (15-14) with 18 points on 7-for-18 shooting and Tolu Smith totaled 13 points and six rebounds. But the Bulldogs were held to 29.0 percent shooting (18 of 62) and made only one of their 19 three-point attempts. Jaden Shackelford totaled 13 points and went 3-for-6 from 3-point range for Alabama. Alabama freshman guard Joshua Primo injured his knee with 12:35 left in the second half when Molinar landed on his left leg. Primo, who finished with eight points and four rebounds, had to be helped to the locker room. --Field Level Media",

A clearly exasperated Jen Psaki on Friday refused to give the Trump administration credit for its work on the COVID vaccine         Conservatives were furious when President Joe Biden didn't mention Operation Warp Speed or President Trump in his address to the nation on Thursday nightShe argued the 'purpose' of Biden's prime time address was to talk about his own administration - 'what he has done since he took office, the progress that's been made, what the work is ahead, provide a light at the end of the tunnel and ask Americans to engage in the process.'A reporter pressed Psaki on Biden's speech, asking: 'Why not just say, with credit to the previous administration and the former president for putting us in this position, we are glad that we have been able to move it forward?'\u00a0Psaki dismissed the question as an 'excellent recommendation as a speechwriter.'\u00a0She then got a shot at Trump supporters, saying Americans are looking for facts and details about the battle against the virus.\u00a0'I don't think they're worrying too much about applause from six months ago,' she said.Biden and many medical experts were critical of President Trump for not wearing a face mask in public and for referring to COVID-19 as the 'China virus' - a racist moniker. The Trump administration argued Americans have a right to decide whether or not to wear a face mask.\u00a0But the Trump Administration established Operation Warp Speed last April to facilitate and accelerate the development of a vaccine.\u00a0The Pfizer vaccine, which was first out of the gate, was developed privately. But the Moderna vaccine, which like Pfizer is extremely effective, got assistance from Trump's Operation Warp Speed and were developed during his administration.During his speech, Biden noted his administration brought about the collaboration of two pharmaceutical companies, Johnson and Johnson and Merck, to speed up vaccine manufacturing of the J&J one-shot vaccine.But the Washington Post reported on Thursday that the deal between the companies was initiated by Trump officials, according to four Trump administration officials.And, The\u00a0New York Times, in an article this week, declared:\u00a0'Both administrations deserve credit, although neither wants to grant much to the other.'

        "full article": "DOHA, Qatar (AP) - Roberto Bautista Agut ended Andrey Rublev's Qatar Open title defense in the semifinals by upsetting the Russian 6-3, 6-3 on Friday. Rublev was also aiming for back-to-back titles after winning the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam on Sunday. The Russian was in the unusual position of playing a semifinal without having spent a minute on court in the singles tournament following a bye and two walkovers, though he had been playing doubles. Rublev served eight aces but still had his serve broken four times by Bautista Agut. Bautista Agut is into his second final of 2021 following a loss to David Goffin in Montpellier last month. His win at the Qatar Open in January 2019 remains his most recent title on the tour. The 13th-ranked Spanish player will face Nikoloz Basilashvili for the title in Saturday's final after the Georgian beat Taylor Fritz 7-6 (3), 6-1. Basilashvili is in his first final since July 2019 after a Qatar campaign which included a win over Roger Federer's in the quarterfinals. ___ More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

The move came as the country was poised to soon administer the 100 millionth shot since its inoculation campaign began on December 14. Biden wants every adult to be eligible for a vaccine by May 1, with the goal of beginning to return to normal by July 4, the United States' independence day. \"The Department of Health and Human Services will launch a new portal to help individuals determine where they can sign up to volunteer to administer shots,\" Marcella Nunez-Smith, who leads the administration's health equity task force, told reporters. The administration previously authorized any physician or most classes of nurse either active or retired in the past five years to administer the shots. With the new action, more classes of vaccinators have been authorized including dentists, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), midwives, optometrists, paramedics, physician assistants, podiatrists, respiratory therapists and veterinarians. Students in those categories are also authorized. The United States is currently vaccinating around 2.2 million shots per day, while almost 65 percent of Americans 65 and older have gotten at least their first shot. The state of Michigan said Friday it wanted to drop eligibility requirements for vaccines by April 5, effectively ushering in \"open season\" for all adults. Alaska became the first state to eliminate priority groups on Tuesday. The Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines have all been authorized for emergency use, and the companies are set to deliver more than enough to cover the entire US population by mid-year. AstraZeneca and Novavax are also carrying out late stage clinical trials for their vaccines that could also be authorized if they perform comparably to those already being distributed, and are still required.",

        "full article": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Playing as the Southeastern Conference Tournament\u00b4s team to beat for the first time since 2002, Alabama seemed intent on proving its worth - early, quickly and effectively. Jahvon Quinerly scored 14 points off the bench, Jaden Shackelford added 13 points and No. 6 Alabama blew out Mississippi State 85-48 on Friday in an SEC quarterfinal. The top-seeded Crimson Tide (22-6) will face fourth-seeded Tennessee in Saturday\u00b4s semifinals. Alabama followed a couple of small early runs with a 17-0 surge over nearly five minutes for an eventual 43-13 cushion just before halftime. The Tide also swarmed the Bulldogs defensively, scoring 24 points off 14 first-half turnovers and holding them to 30% shooting overall. \"Defensively, I thought we were really locked in for a good part of that game,\" coach Nate Oats said. As expected of the nation's second-ranked perimeter team, 13 3-pointers propelled the Tide\u00b4s explosive attack with Shackelford and John Petty Jr. leading the way. Shackelford made 3 of 6 from deep. Petty hit 3 of 7, including consecutive left-corner jumpers during the big run, for his nine points.          Alabama's Jahvon Quinerly (13) and John Petty Jr. (23) celebrate in the final moments of Alabama's win over Mississippi State in an NCAA college basketball game in the Southeastern Conference Tournament Friday, March 12, 2021, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)  Quinerly was 6 of 8 shooting with two 3s. SEC player of the year Herbert Jones had eight points, seven rebounds, seven assists, three steals and two blocks in 17 minutes. Juwan Gary made all four shots for 11 points as the Tide's bench routed the Bulldogs' reserves 47-5. Alabama shot 49% in winning its fourth consecutive game and third this season over the Bulldogs. Not bad considering the early-morning wakeup call and tipoff. \"There was a lot of questions about us coming out in these early games,\" Petty said. \"Previously we didn\u00b4t really do too good. But I feel like our guys did a great job getting up this morning, getting real locked in and it showed out there on the court.\" Iverson Molinar scored 18 points, Tolu Smith had 11 and Abdul Ado grabbed 11 rebounds for ninth-seeded Mississippi State (15-14), which outrebounded the Tide 43-35 but finished 1 of 19 from long range and committed 18 turnovers. The loss was especially hard to accept for Bulldogs coach Ben Howland, whose team had lost its two regular-season games against Alabama by single digits. \"To get beat this badly was really, really a bitter pill,\" he said. \"We were 1 of 19 from the 3-point line and you're not going to win many games doing that.\" BALL PROTECTION Alabama had 20 assists and committed just nine turnovers, efficiency that also pleased Oats. \"The ball was moving,\" he said. \"We made shots, but we didn\u00b4t shoot it like unbelievably well - 36% is probably a little below average. But we shot it well enough and we took care of the ball.\" INJURY REPORT Alabama guard Josh Primo (eight points) left with 12:35 remaining with a knee injury and did not return. He was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for further observation. BIG PICTURE Mississippi State: A day after owning the paint against Kentucky, the Bulldogs rarely got a chance to establish their presence. They couldn\u00b4t match Alabama\u00b4s perimeter game on either end, digging a hole too deep. Alabama: So much for any concern about the Crimson Tide being rusty from a double bye. Active defense led to easy offensive opportunities, and their fast pace created a lot of second chances as well. Alabama drained 3s in bunches to put this game away early and protected the ball. Asked if it was the team's most complete game this season, Jones agreed and added, \"That was not surprising at all to me. I see it every day in practice. We started on the defensive end and our shots were falling. We\u00b4re going to come out and play defense every night but when our shots are falling, we\u00b4re very dangerous.\" ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25          Mississippi State head coach Ben Howland and Iverson Molinar (1) leave the court after a loss to Alabama in an NCAA college basketball game in the Southeastern Conference Tournament Friday, March 12, 2021, in Nashville, Tenn.

        "full article": "Quarterback Tom Brady signed a contract extension with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that reportedly will enable him to reach his goal of playing in the NFL until he is at least 45. The Buccaneers announced the transaction on Friday, however did not divulge the terms of the deal. ESPN reported on Friday that Brady and the Buccaneers reached an agreement on a four-year contract extension that voids to a one-year extension. Brady, who will turn 44 in August, is contractually linked with the Buccaneers through the 2022 season. \"In pursuit of 8...LFG @Buccaneers we're keeping the band together,\" Brady wrote on Twitter, accompanied by a picture presumably of him signing a contract. The fancy footwork with the contract saves Tampa Bay $19 million against the cap this season. The three voidable years of the deal creates salary-cap room for the Bucs, who signed linebackers Lavonte David and Keith Minter to contracts on Friday. The Buccaneers entered the month not knowing where the cash might come from to retain their key free agents. Wide receiver Chris Godwin was given the franchise tag and David re-signed on Friday, leaving pass rusher Shaq Barrett as the top pending free agent who remains unsigned. Tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receiver Antonio Brown are also unrestricted free agents. Brady signed a two-year deal in free agency in March 2020, exiting New England for $25 million in 2020 and the same amount in 2021. Brady's first season in Tampa Bay was an unmitigated success. He earned his seventh Super Bowl ring last month when the Buccaneers cruised to a 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. He threw three touchdowns while winning Super Bowl MVP honors for the fifth time. \"When we acquired Tom a year ago, we were extremely excited about the leadership, poise and winning track record that he would bring to our locker room. Since that time, he has proven himself to be the ultimate competitor and delivered in every way we had imagined, helping us capture the Lombardi Trophy,\" Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said. \"Year after year, Tom proves that he remains one of the elite quarterbacks in this game and we couldn't be happier to keep him in Tampa Bay as we continue to pursue our goals together.\" Brady threw for 4,633 yards and tossed a team-record 40 touchdown passes, his second-highest total in a single season in his career. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Friday designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law aimed at protecting U.S. communications networks. The FCC said the companies included Huawei Technologies Co , ZTE Corp, Hytera Communications Corp , Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. A 2019 law requires the FCC to identify companies producing telecommunications equipment and services \"that have been found to pose an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security.\" Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement: \"This list provides meaningful guidance that will ensure that as next-generation networks are built across the country, they do not repeat the mistakes of the past or use equipment or services that will pose a threat to U.S. national security or the security and safety of Americans.\" The 2019 law used criteria from a defense authorization bill that previously identified the five Chinese companies. In August 2020, the U.S. government issued regulations barring agencies from buying goods or services from any of the five Chinese companies. In 2019, the United States placed Huawei, Hikvision and other firms on its economic blacklist. Last year, the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as a national security threat to communications networks - a declaration barring U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies. In February, Huawei challenged the declaration in a petition filed with the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Huawei declined to comment on Friday on the new FCC designation. Hikvision said late on Friday it strongly opposed the FCC decision \"and is weighing all options on how to best address this unsubstantiated designation. Hikvision does not belong on a list for next-generation networks.\" The other three companies did not comment or could not be reached for comment. The FCC in December finalized rules requiring carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to \"rip and replace\" that equipment. It created a reimbursement program for that effort, and U.S. lawmakers in December approved $1.9 billion to fund the program.

        "full article": "BRASILIA, March 12 (Reuters) - The office of Brazil's prosecutor general on Friday appealed a Supreme Court judge's ruling earlier this week that annulled the criminal convictions of former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. If successful, the appeal could close the door on the popular politician running in next year's presidential election, which had become a reality after Monday's surprise decision by Justice Edson Fachin. Two opinion polls published on Friday, the first since Lula's convictions were annulled, showed that President Jair Bolsonaro is still favored to win the 2022 election but his advantage has shrunk, and one said 61% do not approve of his handling of the pandemic that has taken 270,000 lives. The survey for Exame business news magazine by pollster Ideia found that Bolsonaro would win a run-off against Lula by 7 percentage points if the vote were held today. But another poll by XP Investimentos showed him only 2 points ahead of Lula in voter intentions, 27% to 25%, as his approval ratings slip in the world's second-deadliest COVID-19 outbreak. The prosecutor's office had said on Monday it would appeal. It said Lula's convictions must be upheld in order to preserve \"procedural stability and legal certainty.\" Fachin had ruled that a court in the southern city of Curitiba had lacked the authority to try Lula on corruption charges and that he must be retried in federal courts in the capital Brasilia. Brazilian media and markets have spent the week dissecting the prospect of an ultra-polarized race between Bolsonaro, a far-right populist, and Lula, his biggest opponent on the left. The Exame/Ideia poll, which has a margin of error of 3 percentage points, said that 54% of those surveyed opposed the annulment of Lula's convictions. \"Lula has a very good chance of making it to a run-off, but to win he still needs to anesthetize the rejection of Brazil's middle class,\" said Ideia pollster Mauricio Moura.

We were so good. How did we do it? Those who reviewed the evidence around Doctor Richard Freeman think, on balance of probabilities, that we cheated.

Yet the conclusion of a tribunal that seemed to pre-date the Hippocratic Oath itself is that Freeman took delivery of testosterone to provide to a rider, and then lied about it.He destroyed laptops, left hugely convenient gaps in his record-taking, suffered mystifying absences of memory or holes in his knowledge, and the tribunal concluded accordingly. He was at it.This is a method of deduction called Occam\u2019s razor, after the 14th century theologist William of Ockham. Boiled down, he reasoned that the simplest solution is usually the right one.Faced with competing explanations for an event, shave away the outlandish outer layers until only the most obvious remains. That, Ockham extrapolated, is usually what has happened.         The doctor worked for Team Sky (pictured) and British Cycling between 2010 and 2017The tribunal considered the possibility that a doctor would be unaware of testosterone\u2019s properties, that he would misguidedly use it to treat erectile dysfunction, that he would have packages sent to his place of work despite the enormous jeopardy for what was essentially a private matter, that it was pure coincidence cycling\u2019s drug of choice would arrive addressed to the leading medic for British Cycling and Team Sky and concluded: No.The simplest explanation held the answer. Freeman ordered testosterone to dope a rider. We just don\u2019t know which rider. Maybe a lot of them. The suspicion spreads wide. \u2018If it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck,\u2019 wrote Richard Ings, the respected former head of Australian Sports Anti-Doping on Friday, \u2018then it\u2019s probably a duck.\u2019 Occam\u2019s duck, maybe.And this cloud will not just settle on some household-name athletes. Summing up at last month\u2019s hearing, Freeman\u2019s QC, Mary O\u2019Rourke, referred to Sir Dave Brailsford as the spectre at the proceedings. A ghostly presence, heard about but not from. Brailsford, the maestro of marginal gains, was never called, never questioned.Shane Sutton, who was and did not take it well, issued a statement on Friday. \u2018I\u2019d like to stress that neither I nor Sir Dave Brailsford knew about the testosterone order,\u2019 he insisted. Yet like so much of what has tumbled out across approximately 17 months of inquisition, there will be those who remain incredulous.On the day in 2011 that Phil Burt, head of physiotherapy at British Cycling between 2006 and 2018, discovered the delivery of Testogel, he took it immediately to clinical director Steve Peters, who was in a room with Freeman, seeking an explanation.\u00a0         Freeman claimed he ordered the\u00a0testosterone at the request of former coach Shane Sutton to treat his erectile dysfunction - claims that the Australian\u00a0angrily denied         Freeman lied. He said the delivery had been made in error. It was the first of many clumsy cover-ups.Yet even if Peters accepted it entirely at face value \u2014 and there is no reason why he should not \u2014 given testosterone\u2019s significance in cycling, is it plausible that this was not even mentioned to Brailsford, whose reputation for involvement and micro-management is without measure?A delivery of Testogel to the velodrome and Brailsford is out of the loop? It would be like the Marvel universe accepting a shipment of Kryptonite and nobody telling Superman. Yet, throughout, this is what we are asked to believe of British Cycling and its masters.That a body with such attention to detail that it transformed the sport were in fact a bunch of silly old scatterbrains; who didn\u2019t keep proper medical records, who couldn\u2019t remember what medicine was in a Jiffy bag flown across Europe, who didn\u2019t know exactly how testosterone worked despite, in Freeman\u2019s case, writing a book called The Line \u2014 Where Medicine and Sport Collide.\u2018As team doctor for British Cycling and Team Sky, Dr Richard Freeman treated the world\u2019s most successful cyclists, such as Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins, Laura Trott and Victoria Pendleton,\u2019 runs the blurb.         Dubbed 'the Gold Medal factory', the verdict has called into question both teams' success\u00a0\u2018From 2009 until 2017, the \u2018Doc\u2019 was part of the team who became national heroes with Olympic and Tour de France victories. In The Line, Dr Freeman reveals the medical principles and practices that helped lead these athletes to success \u2014 the ideas we now consider commonplace, but were in fact the Doc\u2019s own innovations.\u2019 SHANE SUTTON STATEMENT \u2018I\u2019m saddened by the whole affair. I feel for the doctor; that he ever got into this situation, and I remain disappointed that I was used as a scapegoat.\u2018It has caused great pain to both me and my family. But it also saddens me that this episode has cast a huge shadow over the success we enjoyed, both at Team Sky and British Cycling.\u2018I\u2019d like to stress that neither I nor Sir Dave Brailsford knew about the testosterone order.\u2018But I think it\u2019s important to find out who the doctor ordered it for. Hopefully that will emerge from the investigation by UK Anti-Doping.\u2019 Advertisement\n And this is the man who told the tribunal he didn\u2019t know testosterone improved performance. Other doctors are available, apparently.Brailsford is also a published author. The Team Sky Way promises to reveal \u2018the tips and secrets that deliver an edge; from training methods and equipment maintenance, to nutrition, tactics and psychology\u2026\u2019And whether to tell the boss when a parcel of illegal, performance-enhancing drugs has just arrived at headquarters? Maybe they\u2019re saving that for the paperback \u2014 although the one rogue doctor line of defence, if pleaded, does not say much for the senior executives. If Freeman acted alone and got away with it for so long, where were the men supposedly obsessed with the details?Where were Brailsford and Peters? Shouldn\u2019t they have noticed the effects of these marginal gains? Shouldn\u2019t they have been a little curious?It is hard to recall a scandal more ruinous for the reputation of British sport. Brailsford is the Team GB poster boy, the guru held up as setting the standards for all.\u00a0He sent British Cycling into the Olympic stratosphere, he took a team who finished nowhere in the 2010 Tour de France and built a mighty force that won in all but a single year between 2012 and 2019.Yet every rider who emerged, and thrived, on Freeman\u2019s watch is now under suspicion. From Bailsford down there is taint, a gnawing doubt. Lance Armstrong spoke of standing at a crossroads, making a decision that changed his sport and his life. It would appear Freeman came to a similar moral junction and made that same call.What is yet to spill out is who, and how many, went with him. HOW A DECADE OF TURMOIL UNFOLDED  By George BondMay 16, 2011As doctor for British Cycling and Team Sky, Freeman orders 30 Testogel sachets from Fit4Sports to the National Cycling Centre in Manchester.Feb 28, 2017Freeman fails to report to a Parliamentary committee hearing into doping, claiming he is too ill to attend.Oct 20, 2017Freeman resigns from Team Sky, ending an eight-year association, citing ill health.Oct 29, 2019Start of Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) hearing. He admits to 18 of 22 charges \u2014 including that he asked Fit4Sports to state that the sachets were sent in error \u2014 but claims GB coach Shane Sutton bullied him into ordering Testogel for Sutton\u2019s erectile dysfunction and not for athletes. Sutton denies this.Oct 7, 2020Freeman claims he had not read the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s rules on ordering Testogel and thought it would be permitted for non-athletes. He then admits he destroyed the sachets, and that he damaged his laptop before turning it in.\u00a0Feb 12, 2021UKAD charge Freeman with two anti-doping violations. On Friday, Freeman is found guilty of ordering testosterone for an unnamed rider.\u00a0 Advertisement\n    RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Former British Cycling and Team Sky chief doctor Richard...

        "full article": "March 12 (Reuters) - Ant Group's CEO Simon Hu unexpectedly resigned on Friday in the midst of the financial technology group's regulatory-driven revamp after its scuttled initial public offering. Following are key events leading up to his departure. OCT. 21: ANT IPO GETS GREEN LIGHT FROM SECURITIES REGULATOR Ant Group wins the final nod from China's top securities watchdog to register its Shanghai initial public offering (IPO), clearing the last regulatory hurdle for its issue. OCT. 24: 'OLD MAN'S CLUB' At a public event attended by Chinese regulators, Ant founder and billionaire Jack Ma said the financial and regulatory system stifled innovation and must be reformed to fuel growth. He also compared the Basel Committee of global banking regulators to \"an old man's club\". OCT. 30: MOM-AND-POP INVESTORS BID $3 TRILLION FOR SHARES Retail investors bid for a record $3 trillion worth of shares in Ant's dual listing, the equivalent of Britain's annual gross domestic product, as they bet on demand for Ant's financial technology services in China. NOV. 2: REGULATORS ANNOUNCE TALKS WITH ANT Four of China's top financial regulators say they conducted regulatory talks with Ma and Ant's top two executives. Chinese regulators recommend tighter regulations for online micro-lending companies to help contain potential financial risks and rein in rising debt levels. NOV. 3: SHANGHAI IPO SUSPENDED, ANT FREEZES HK IPO The Shanghai stock exchange suspends Ant's IPO on its tech-focused STAR Market, citing the regulatory talks as a \"material event\" and a tougher regulatory environment as factors that may disqualify Ant from listing. The move prompts Ant to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of its dual listing. DEC. 27: CHINA PUSHES ANT GROUP OVERHAUL China's central bank says it has asked Ant to shake up its lending and other consumer finance business. FEB. 3, 2021: ANT AGREES RESTRUCTURING PLAN Ant Group agrees a restructuring plan with Chinese regulators under which it will become a financial holding company, a person with direct knowledge of the matter says. FEB 4: ANT TO HIVE OFF CONSUMER CREDIT BUSINESS Ant Group plans to hive off its consumer credit data operations, people with knowledge of the matter say, a concession to regulators that could help get its massive public share sale back on track. MARCH 2: STAFF CONCERNS ABOUT SELLING COMPANY'S SHARES Ant's executive chairman says the group is working on measures to help staff with \"short-term liquidity problems\", after the suspension of its IPO dashed employees' hopes of cashing in their shares. MARCH 12: HU RESIGNS AS CEO, ERIC JING TAKES OVER Chief Executive Simon Hu unexpectedly resigns, the first top management exit since the scuppered $37 billion IPO.

        "title": "Britain commits to LGBT+ 'conversion therapy' ban after resignations",
        "full article": "By Rachel Savage and Hugo Greenhalgh LONDON, March 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain's government promised on Friday to push ahead with a ban on so-called conversion therapy, after three LGBT+ policy advisers questioned ministers' commitment to fulfilling the pledge and resigned in protest this week. As other nations outlaw attempts to change people's sexual orientation or gender identity, Junior Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch angered LGBT+ advocates by talking of \"ending\" conversion therapy rather than committing to a legislative ban. But Liz Truss, women and equalities minister, said the government was committed to the pledge it made almost three years ago to outlaw the practice. \"We're very committed to LGBT equality... and will shortly be bringing forward plans to ban conversion therapy, which is an abhorrent practice,\" Truss told British broadcaster ITV. Her comments were welcomed by Jayne Ozanne, a prominent gay Anglican and one of the three advisers who resigned from the government's LGBT Advisory Panel following Badenoch's comments in parliament on Monday. \"Obviously, I'm really pleased and welcome the fact that the secretary of state has now unequivocally used the word ban and made clear that's what she wants,\" Ozanne told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"But the devil is in the detail and we will need to look very clearly at the proposed legislation to ensure it protects the most vulnerable,\" Ozanne said, adding that she would consider returning to her post on the advisory panel. LGBT+ conversion therapy, criticised as harmful by the United Nations and numerous medical groups, is outlawed in Brazil, Ecuador and Malta. Germany banned it for minors last year and several other countries are mulling similar restrictions or outright bans. In recent months, LGBT+ campaigners have criticised Britain's government for not yet banning the practice, despite having first pledged to do so in 2018. \"The government has dithered for almost 1,000 days,\" veteran human rights activist Peter Tatchell said in a statement. \"We will not let up until we see the details and timetable of the new law. The ban must protect trans people and apply to religious practices.\" A 2017 British government survey of 108,000 LGBT+ people found 2% had gone through conversion therapy, while a further 5% had been offered it.

        "full article": "London mayor hopeful Shaun Bailey has vowed to work with the country\u2019s top companies to create apprenticeships that will help them uncover black executives if he wins the election.Mr Bailey told MailOnline that diverse boardrooms would also help Britain in the post-Brexit era as it becomes more international by negotiating its own trade deals with countries around the world.The Conservative candidate was speaking after research published earlier this month showed that there was not a single black executive at the very top of the biggest companies on the London Stock Exchange.For the first time in six years, there are no black CEOs, CFOs or chairs in the FTSE 100 Index, according to a study published by Green Park, an executive recruitment and diversity consultancy agency.         London mayor hopeful Shaun Bailey spoke out after research showed there was not a single black executive at the very top of the biggest companies on the London Stock ExchangeMr Bailey said: \u2018Britain is going to become even more international in how it does business following Brexit and diverse boardrooms will only help this.\u2018Senior executives at our top companies need to do more to make this happen and it\u2019s a real pity that the figures for black representation in our boardrooms have gone down.\u00a0'This is not about naming and shaming the big companies but about working with them to identify the people who have got talent and rewarding them.\u2019The Green Park study also showed that no progress has been made on diversity since the organisation began researching the issue. Only 10 of 297 people in the three top leadership positions do not identify as white, the same proportion as in 2014.Mr Bailey said that if he takes over as London Mayor following the May 6 election, he will work with the FTSE 100 companies to create apprenticeships for graduates from BAME communities and others from disadvantaged backgrounds.

This is about getting companies to identify the right people and working with them to get them into the top positions.\u2018Graduate level apprenticeships done in the right way would help people who come from unusual backgrounds and give them opportunities that they may not have had. We are talking about people who are hugely gifted but do not have the networks to break into the top companies.\u2019Mr Bailey also said that he would co-operate with FTSE companies to establish mentoring schemes and also build relations with schools across the capital, insisting that he would use City Hall as a \u2018catalyst\u2019 for this.He added: \u2018There needs to be mentoring for those who are recruited, where they are paired with more senior staff so that they can be supported to succeed in the company and work their way to the top.         London mayor hopeful Shaun Bailey has vowed to work with the country\u2019s top companies to create apprenticeships that will help them uncover black executives\u2018But I would also initiate a schools programme, where FTSE companies can start building networks from the start.\u2018Top companies need to start looking in unusual places from where they currently recruit by going into diverse communities and trying to uncover and nurture the huge amount of talent that is already there.\u2019Mr Bailey insisted that he is against quotas, which he maintained \u2018do not work.\u2019He added: \u2018We are not talking about token quotas because that means putting people into positions where they might not have the right skills. They are there for all the wrong reasons.\u2018But there is plenty of talent out there in our diverse communities, it just needs to be uncovered and developed. Companies just need to look beyond the normal and find and reward the right people.\u2019",

Israeli media said police opened an investigation. In a statement, Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, 61, denied the allegations detailed by the Haaretz daily a day earlier. The newspaper said it had interviewed six accusers and obtained evidence of sexual assault and exploitation going back decades, including of teenagers and younger children. The allegations surfaced just days after Meshi-Zahav was awarded the nation's most prestigious honor, the Israel Prize, for his work in ZAKA, the search and rescue organization he co-founded. The organization, drawing from thousands of volunteers, became internationally known in the 1990s when it responded to a wave of attacks by Palestinian militants.

        "full article": "Dear Bel,Ten years ago, I began an affair with a wonderful man and left my husband for him. It didn\u2019t work out, because my family and children abandoned me. Ultimately, I chose them and returned to my husband.That was five years ago. A year later, I resumed contact with my lover and began seeing him again \u2014 but lied, telling him I had left my husband and was on my own. It was the only way I knew he would have me back.You may find it bewildering but I have lived a double life until now, being with both men: a husband who loves me dearly and is a wonderful father to our grown-up children \u2014 and my lover whom I love passionately.Just this week my lover found out the truth that, yes, I am still with my husband. He is angry and has wished me dead, sent awful messages, and blocked me from all platforms. He is quite right. I am an intelligent 59-year-old and don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve got myself into this place.I feel distraught with guilt for what I\u2019ve done and am barely able to function. I\u2019ve been hurting two men \u2014 and have lost one for ever.My husband is unaware of all this and the fact that my lover was back in my life. All those years ago, I should have stayed with my lover, but the pain of being shut out from my family was too much.The pain I am feeling for all the deceit is unbearable. I don\u2019t know how to move on or forgive myself for the treacherous lies and the hurt my lover is facing now.I\u2019ve caused this, he didn\u2019t deserve it. I don\u2019t resemble the person I once was, and I should be punished for all of this. Can you please help?JENNY         This week, Bel Mooney advises a reader who has been having an affair for more than 10 yearsYou write \u2018I should be punished for all this\u2019, which interests me greatly \u2014 for the idea of being punished for sins is as old as humanity, and (leaving religion aside) it must be because people dislike sinners \u2018getting away with it\u2019.People are quick to pass judgment on others, but at the same time don\u2019t like being told what to do. Don\u2019t bore us with those outdated Ten Commandments! To some people \u2018being judgmental\u2019 is a sin worse than the Seven Deadly Sins rolled together. But modernity can\u2019t rub out ancient ideas about wrongdoing. Without taboos, society falls apart.It seems obvious to me that you are, in fact, already being punished. You are eaten up with guilt \u2014 and rightly so. When you write \u2018my family and my children abandoned me\u2019, it sounds as if you were the one to be hurt and ill-treated \u2014 when of course it was you who chose to abandon them by choosing your lover.You went back after five years to a blameless husband who must be extraordinarily strong and forgiving.But then it became worse because you lied to both men and managed to keep it a secret. Lordy, how did you find the energy for all the double-dealing and imagination for so many lies?Strange as it may seem, I do understand why you got into this mess. The passion for your lover was such that you couldn\u2019t let him go, and (being greedy, which I also get) you thought you could have them both. THOUGHT OF THE DAY\u00a0Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain, Though your dreams be tossed and blown, Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart\u2026\u00a0From You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone by Oscar Hammerstein II (1895-1960)Advertisement\nWeeks pass, then months . . . and you get away with it. And all the while the tension and excitement and fear breathe life into your veins \u2014 especially when you fear old age and want to cling to both sexuality (lover) and security (husband).Since countless readers will be passing judgment on you, I shall desist, as I\u2019ve sinned plenty myself over the years. Now you\u2019re left with this guilt, the knowledge that your husband remains the deceived victim, and your misery at having lost the object of your passion. Is it possible actually to forgive yourself?In the Bible, Jesus rescued the woman caught in adultery who was about to be stoned to death (John 8:11) by suggesting that only someone without sin himself should cast the first stone.He then told the woman: \u2018Go thou and sin no more.\u2019 Such wisdom for both the judgmental ones and the judged. He doesn\u2019t say, go away and forgive yourself. Perhaps you never will. But your lover does \u2018deserve\u2019 the pain, because he was complicit.The only way you can atone now is by living a good life with the husband who didn\u2019t deserve to be left and was told multiple lies. Go back to being the woman he fell in love with all those years ago. That is how it is, Jenny.In time, this pain will cease and when you are old you\u2019ll look back and wonder why you put yourself through so much misery \u2014 love or no love.Dear Bel,Six months ago, my granddaughter aged 15 decided she wants to transition to become a male. I am 78 and find it hard to accept but unless I call her Dan, I get ignored \u2014 as does the rest of the family.My son and his wife have been divorced for 12 years. There are no other children. They feel that if they go along with it, Dan may grow out of it.As a young child, she was very much a girl: long hair, feminine clothes, dolls.They all live about three hours away so I don\u2019t get to see them very often, but this is still worrying me and so I would be glad of your input.HILARY\u00a0 \u00a0My grandchild wants to transition to be a boyIt is very hard to come to terms with change \u2013 and all the more so as we grow older. In your position, I would feel just as worried about the future. But you should perhaps take some comfort that you live a distance away, in that there\u2019s a buffer between you and this phase for your grandchild.It may pass quickly, because teenagers can change their minds frequently \u2014 and Dan might decide to become a Goth in three months\u2019 time. Being 15 has always been tough. While we regret the loss of a sweet child we loved, we also have to realise how many problems teenagers face \u2014 and more so in these days of social media.If Dan\u2019s wish to live as a boy proves to be an expression of a true inner self, and is long-lasting, then maximum support will have to come from both parents. It would be natural to write \u2018. . . and you too\u2019, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s strictly true.This issue may make you feel sad and worried, but there is nothing you can do, except chat to your son and daughter-in-law whenever possible. Their laid-back approach is probably wise, but they may be just as worried as you and need a friendly ear.Meanwhile, why do you have to call your grandchild any name at all? If you phone, or if the family visits once lockdown has ended, I would use \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018pet\u2019 or \u2018darling\u2019 or whatever feels natural, because calm endearments have no gender.\u00a0 Will my new man, 87, stay with me?\u00a0Dear BelI am a widow of 81. Both my marriages have ended in widowhood. For six weeks I had a romantic relationship with Bill, who is 87 and was made a widower last October after 60 years of marriage.He and his late wife were church friends of my late husband and me. Bill and I were very comfortable in each other\u2019s company and laughed a lot. He is about to move into a nice flat 14 miles away.Bill\u2019s two daughters are opposed to our relationship \u2014 understandable as their mother died only four months ago. A week ago he phoned and abruptly said we must part for two months.Since he\u2019s moving very shortly I have a feeling I will never see him again \u2014 and feel very upset. Life had suddenly become worthwhile \u2014 and now it is not. Can you give me some words of comfort?PAT Contact Bel\u00a0  Bel answers readers' questions on emotional and relationship problems each week.Write to Bel Mooney, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT, or email bel.mooney@dailymail.co.uk.A pseudonym will be used if you wish.Bel reads all letters but regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence. Advertisement\n What a wonderful life you\u2019ve led, with two long marriages behind you, teaching you about love and loss. And how glorious that at 81 you still feel your heart full of love.Age cannot stop that life force, that quest for more happiness \u2014 and I admire your zest for life and love, as well as your understanding of his daughters\u2019 feelings. You sound like a wonderful person.Of course you\u2019re sad now, because it seems an unexpectedly happy time has ended. I\u2019m wondering if Bill is moving because he wants to \u2014 or to be near one of his daughters.Whatever the reason, he will only be 14 miles away.

Why not?There is no shame or infidelity in this story; just two young people fated not to be together \u2014 and one destined to die.Truly, I would tell my husband everything and know he would listen. So why can\u2019t Mary? What stops people confiding in each other?And what can I do with these relics? Only sadly consign them (in time) to healing flames, with a blessing.",

        "title": "Howard tossed, No. 4 Michigan tops Terps, Big Ten semis next",
        "full article": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - All Michigan coach Juwan Howard intended to do, he said, when he started walking toward the baseline during the second half of Friday\u00b4s Big Ten Tournament quarterfinals was question a call. Maryland coach Mark Turgeon, meanwhile, had already seen enough. He didn\u00b4t like what he'd heard during the teams' previous two games and didn\u00b4t appreciate the conference's response when he reported his concerns. Moments after Turgeon told Howard not to speak to him, a shouting match broke out. A tense situation quickly escalated, tempers flared and both teams gathered near midcourt, with officials rushing in to hold back each side. The 6-foot-9 Howard had to be restrained, drew two technical fouls and was ejected with 10:44 left to play. Minus their coach, No. 4 Michigan pulled away for a testy 79-66 victory. After the game, Howard apologized for his actions - and also placed blame on the other bench. \"That\u00b4s not how you handle things under adverse conditions,\" he said before explaining his version of what happened.          Michigan head coach Juwan Howard is restrained after being ejected from the game in the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Maryland at the Big Ten Conference tournament in Indianapolis, Friday, March 12, 2021. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)  \"He said, `Juwan, I\u00b4m not going to let you talk to me. Don\u00b4t talk to me ever again,\u00b4 Then he charged at me. I don\u00b4t know how you were raised but the way I was raised is when someone charges you, you defend yourself.\" Turgeon was called for a technical foul but not ejected. \"This has been going on for three games,\" he said. \"I \u00b4ve been doing this for 34 years and I\u00b4ve called the conference office, I\u00b4ve called the commissioner and I said `I won\u00b4t take it the third game.\u00b4 So I stood up for myself and my team. All I said is, `Don\u00b4t talk to me, don\u00b4t talk to me.\u00b4\" Maryland scored five points after the fracas to cut the deficit in half. \"Coach is a really competitive guy the game got competitive, we knew we had to have his back,\" Michigan guard Mike Smith said. Smith helped steady the Wolverines (20-8) by scoring a season-high 18 points while dishing out a tournament-record 15 assists. Michigan next faces longtime rival No. 9 Ohio State on Saturday. Down by 12 early, the top-seeded and regular-season champion Wolverines swung the game by ending the first half on a 16-2 run and starting the second half on an 11-4 spurt. Franz Wagner and Eli Brooks each scored 16 points as Michigan reached the semifinal for a fifth consecutive time. Eric Ayala scored 19 points and Darryl Morsell added 16 to lead the eighth-seeded Terrapins (16-13). BIG PICTURE Maryland: A strong finish - and Thursday's victory over Michigan State - should be enough to get an NCAA Tournament bid. But shooting 74% from the field through the first 15 minutes, the Terrapins' shooting touch went away and the predictable result was a third straight loss in this season series. Michigan: After some early jitters, the Wolverines settled down and played their game. Michigan is 7-2 since resuming basketball activities following a COVID-19 shutdown, with six of those wins by at least seven points. The biggest impediment to a tourney title this weekend might be fatigue. STAT PACK Maryland: Morsell also had six rebounds to become the 33rd player in school history with 1,000 points and 500 rebounds. ... Ayala had five rebounds and Aaron Wiggins had 11 points, seven rebounds and five assists. ... After starting the game 14 of 19 from the field, Maryland went 12 of 35 over the final 25 minutes. Michigan: Chaundee Brown Jr. had 10 points. ... Brooks made four of Michigan\u00b4s 10 3s. ... The Wolverines outscored Maryland 15-0 in second-chance points. ... Michigan is one win away from making its fourth straight appearance in the conference championship game. UP NEXT Maryland: Will find out its next opponent on Selection Sunday. Michigan: Will get a rematch with No. 9 Ohio State, the Wolverines longtime rival. ___ For more AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25          Michigan head coach Juwan Howard questions a call in the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Maryland at the Big Ten Conference tournament in Indianapolis, Friday, March 12, 2021.

        "title": "Why I went a bit wild after my Covid jab: DR MICHAEL MOSLEY says he forgot the rules in his excitement... but whatever you do, don't be put off by the vaccine myths - they're not true",
        "full article": "One of the advantages of being over 60 is that I recently got a Covid jab (AstraZeneca, as it happens).It was all incredibly easy and apart from the brief sting of the injection, I had no side-effects \u2014 except cockiness.The morning after my vaccine, feeling bright and cheerful, I went along to the supermarket and reached across a fellow shopper to grab a can of tomatoes.\u00a0       It's vital we get transmission rates down and achieve 'herd immunity' quickly, not just to return to normal life, but because this gives new mutations less chance to take hold. Pictured: A vaccine being givenI was wearing a mask, but not surprisingly he angrily shouted, 'Oi! Two metres', before recognising me from the TV and saying sternly, 'You should know better'.He was right, I was too close and I hadn't even noticed what I was doing. Perhaps I did it because, unconsciously, I was now convinced I was immune.This is called risk compensation behaviour \u2014 you become more careless when you feel better protected. Another example is cyclists who ride their bikes less cautiously when wearing helmets because they feel safer.This could become quite a common problem as the vaccine programme rolls out. In a survey last December, 40 per cent of people said they'd be less likely to follow lockdown rules after being vaccinated and many thought they'd be protected immediately after the first jab.Indeed, new figures show that four in ten of the over-80s met indoors with someone outside their bubble within three weeks of their first jab.         The good news is that we Brits are now among the world's most enthusiastic embracers of the Covid vaccine; a survey by Imperial College London and YouGov found that almost 80 per cent say we'll have itBut in fact it can take at least a week to start ramping up an adequate antibody response and you don't get full protection until after your second jab.I don't get my second jab until late May, by which time, hopefully, we'll be just weeks away from the end of lockdown. Though that depends, among other things, on enough of us being vaccinated to keep the virus at bay.It's vital we get transmission rates down and achieve 'herd immunity' quickly, not just to return to normal life, but because this gives new mutations less chance to take hold.The good news is that we Brits are now among the world's most enthusiastic embracers of the Covid vaccine; a survey by Imperial College London and YouGov found that almost 80 per cent say we'll have it \u2014 far higher than countries such as France, where just 40 per cent say they'll get it, with 33 per cent indicating they definitely won't.For the 20 per cent in the UK who aren't sure, here are some of the common myths I've come across \u2014 and why I think you shouldn't be worried . . .Myth 1: The vaccine will give you CovidSome vaccines, such as the one for chickenpox, use live but weakened viruses to stimulate your immune system.But neither the Pfizer nor AstraZeneca vaccines use whole viruses \u2014 instead they use genetic material which, once it gets into your cells, makes them churn out versions of the virus's spikes. Feeling a bit ropey after your jab is a sign your immune system is ramping up, but there's no chance the vaccine will give you Covid.Myth 2: The vaccine will alter your DNAAlthough the two vaccines being used in the UK are based on injecting genetic material, none of this genetic material goes into the heart of the cell, the nucleus, where your DNA sits.It's a bit like a factory, where the precious blueprints are kept in a safe, but where the owners are happy to let visitors into the factory to borrow some equipment.Myth 3: The vaccine will make you sterileThis fear, which has no basis in science, seems to have been fanned by a recent mini-series called Utopia, where a mad scientist creates a flu-like illness as an excuse to give people a vaccine that then will make them sterile.In a recent Pfizer trial, involving more than 37,000 people, the women taking part were advised not to get pregnant. Nonetheless, 23 women conceived, probably by accident \u2014 12 of them were in the vaccine group, 11 were in the placebo group.Covid vaccines will not affect your ability to reproduce.         Although the two vaccines being used in the UK are based on injecting genetic material, none of this genetic material goes into the heart of the cell, the nucleus, where your DNA sitsMyth 4: Covid-19 is no big deal for the youngIt's true that if you're under 60 and don't have pre-existing diseases then you're very unlikely to die from Covid if you get it.But you can still then infect others, who might be far more vulnerable. And if you get infected, there is a risk of organ damage \u2014 a study by researchers from University College London, who tracked 200 middle-aged Covid patients, found that four months after being infected, a third still had signs of damage to their heart or lungs \u2014 despite only 18 per cent of the group being ill enough to be hospitalised. There's also the risk of long Covid and symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog and depression.Myth 5: The jabs were developed too quickly   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: How the stress of Covid can turn your...    DR MICHAEL MOSLEY: My top tip for staying trim: Wear a tight...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n\n I've been following the race to develop a Covid vaccine for over a year, and what the scientists did in that time is incredible.But the reason they produced the vaccines so rapidly is not because they cut corners, but because of earlier work done on vaccines against other coronaviruses such as SARS.It's also been a huge international effort. Once the vaccines had been tested in animals, and declared safe, tens of thousands of people around the world agreed to take part in early trials, overseen by independent experts.So far more than 300 million doses have been given worldwide, with remarkably few side-effects.That's why I think the vaccines are safe and effective. But do remember that it takes two jabs to be properly protected \u2014 and try to maintain social distance rules, particularly in supermarkets!\u00a0 Hit the\u00a0dancefloor to keep body AND brain in shape!One of the things I plan to do when the restrictions are eased is to sign up for Zumba classes with my wife, Clare. I'm not a great dancer but it looks fun and you can burn quite a few calories (around 340 per half hour).There's also mounting evidence that vigorous dancing is a great way to keep your brain in shape.A few years ago I teamed up with researchers from Coventry University to look at the impact of salsa (the Latin dance, not the sauce) on the brain.         We put 27 amateur dancers through a range of cognitive tests before a vigorous salsa session. When they were tested again afterwards we saw improvements in many areas of brain function, including visual spatial working memoryWe put 27 amateur dancers through a range of cognitive tests before a vigorous salsa session.When they were tested again afterwards we saw improvements in many areas of brain function, including visual spatial working memory (which you use for navigating familiar locations, for instance).In a more recent long-term study, researchers from the Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Magdeburg, Germany, asked volunteers in their 60s to take up dancing, once a week, for 18 months, or do a more traditional workout.\u00a0Brain scans showed that both groups experienced an increase in the size of the hippocampus, an area that plays a key role in memory and learning \u2014 but this change was more pronounced in the dancing group.The researchers suggested this is not only because they were getting their hearts pumping, but they were also having to learn new dance routines, which is challenging for the brain, in a good way.\u00a0 Crumbs! A toastie is better than a sandwichIf you're ever asked, 'would you like your sandwich heated up', you should answer, 'hell, yeah', particularly if you're watching your weight.That was the conclusion of a study in the journal Appetite by researchers from Rutgers University-Camden. For two weeks they hung around a New York caf\u00e9, noting people who bought cold sandwiches were twice as likely to also buy potato chips or cookies than those buying hot sandwiches.This is probably because people expect cold food to be less enjoyable, so they stock up on something else.Or as Maureen Morrin, a professor of marketing at Rutgers, put it, 'serving temperature of food and beverages impacts aroma and flavour intensity'.She adds that if you're concerned about calorie intake, 'choose hot foods and beverages rather than cold'.",

        "title": "IOC president believes boycotting Beijing Winter Olympics would achieve nothing",
        "full article": "An athlete boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics over China\u2019s human rights abuses would not achieve anything, the president of the International Olympic Committee has said. China has been criticised by human rights groups and activists, in particular its treatment of the Uighur Muslim population. There have been calls for the IOC to use its global position to speak out against the abuse, and for athletes to boycott the Games. However, IOC chief Thomas Bach says those considering a boycott should learn from history. \u201cWe can only repeat and give advice to learn from history \u2013 a boycott of the Olympic Games has never achieved anything,\u201d he said at the end of the IOC Session, held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cBe mindful of the boycott in Moscow in 1980 because of the intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan. The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 \u2013 nine years after. \u201cSo it really served nothing but punishing the athletes and then led to the counter-boycott in Los Angeles. It also has no logic, why would you punish the athletes from your own country if you have a dispute with athletes from another country? \u201cThis just makes no real sense. The athletes would be the ones who are suffering.\u201d Bach also stated that one of the key principles of the Olympic Charter is political neutrality. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked last month whether TeamGB should boycott the event and said: \u201cWe\u2019re not normally in favour of sporting boycotts in this country and that\u2019s been the long-standing position of this Government.\u201d At the same time, TeamGB chef de mission Georgie Harland said there is \u201cno question\u201d of Britain boycotting the Games. On Thursday, the president of the United States\u2019 Olympic and Paralympic Committee Susanne Lyons said it would not boycott Beijing. \u201cBoycotts only hurt athletes who have trained their entire lives for this opportunity to represent their country,\u201d she said. On this summer\u2019s Olympic Games in Tokyo, Bach reiterated his view that the Japanese authorities would have the final say on whether overseas spectators would be allowed into the country. The president of the local organising committee Seiko Hashimoto has said a decision will be taken by March 25, but there have been calls from IOC members during the Session to delay that. Bach said: \u201cThis is not a decision you can implement from one day to another. There is a lot to follow up with regard to the organisation of the Games, this is extremely complex. \u201cThis is why we said from the very beginning this will be the decision of our Japanese partners and friends and we will respect the decision.\u201d",

        "title": "Johnson: NI Protocol not operating as envisaged",
        "full article": "Boris Johnson has said the Northern Ireland Protocol is not operating in the way he envisaged. The Prime Minister said he did not think arrangements he agreed with the EU would involve restrictions on the movements of food products such as sausages, on parcel deliveries and on soil from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland. He said the protocol was operating in an imbalanced way and was causing irritation to the loyalist and unionist community in Northern Ireland as a consequence. In a virtual press conference on a visit to the region, Mr Johnson said: \u201cIt needs to be corrected, you can\u2019t have a situation in which soil or parcels or tractors with mud on their tyres or whatever are prevented from moving easily from one part of the UK to another \u2013 it\u2019s all one United Kingdom.\u201d He said the protocol was an act of \u201cgood neighbourliness\u201d by the UK towards Ireland and the EU to stop goods moving into the single market in an \u201cuncontrolled way\u201d. During Brexit negotiations, debate centred on which products from Great Britain were at risk of continuing from Northern Ireland into the rest of the EU tariff-free. The UK argued that goods like supermarket deliveries intended for Northern Ireland should be exempted from extra paperwork and declarations. Mr Johnson said the protocol was necessitating more processes and checks than it should and that is why the Government moved to delay its implementation until longer term solutions are found with the EU. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t want to see was loads of checks on stuff going from GB to NI in such a way as to interrupt trade and to confuse and irritate people,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see barriers to the circulation of sausages and tractors with mud on their tyres and all the rest of it, and nor did I think that would be necessary and I think that\u2019s why we put in the easements we have, because I think it\u2019s sensible for there to be some balance in this and I think there\u2019s a commonsensical way forward and that\u2019s what we want to have.\u201d He was asked about several legal challenges against the protocol. The DUP is among those threatening litigation. The party will be joining other unionists from across the UK in judicial review proceedings unless alternative post-Brexit trade arrangements are put in place that secure their consent. The Prime Minister questioned whether judgments in those cases could override an international treaty, but acknowledged that legal question required further exploration. He expressed hope that the issues could be ironed out without court challenges. \u201cBefore we get to other people\u2019s legal actions against the protocol, what we want to see is to work with our friends in Dublin, in Brussels, to make sure that we iron this thing out, because at the moment it feels to me like it\u2019s not operating in the way that it\u2019s intended to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s there to protect the EU single market but also the UK single market and the Good Friday Agreement, and all we\u2019re looking for is some balance and some common sense. \u201cThere are more immediate ways of addressing the issues with the protocol and more practical and commonsensical ways than doing it through the courts.\u201d Mr Johnson reiterated his warning that he would move to suspend elements of the protocol \u2013 by invoking Article 16 to the arrangements \u2013 if it proved impossible to resolve current issues. Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster said everything coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain was going through checks despite very few of those goods going on to the EU. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme: \u201cIt is not a proportionate action to take, to check everything going through because so little goes on into the Republic of Ireland.\u201d",

        "title": "Americans support restricting unvaccinated people from offices, travel -poll",
        "full article": "By Chris Kahn NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - A growing number of Americans want to get the coronavirus vaccine, and a majority also support workplace, lifestyle and travel restrictions for those not inoculated against COVID-19, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The national opinion poll of 1,005 people, conducted on Monday and Tuesday, suggested the pace of vaccinations may pick up as more vaccines become available and more people want them. Altogether, 54% of respondents said they were \"very interested\" in getting vaccinated. That was up from a January survey, when 41% expressed the same level of interest, and 38% in a May 2020 poll before a coronavirus vaccine was developed. Interest in the vaccine increased over the past year among whites and racial minorities, with about six in 10 whites and five in 10 members of minority groups now expressing a high level of interest. Twenty-seven percent of Americans said they were not interested in getting vaccinated, which was relatively unchanged from a similar poll that ran in May. But foreshadowing the social challenges that may emerge as the United States begins to pull out of the yearlong pandemic, the latest poll showed a majority of Americans want to limit the ways in which unvaccinated people can mix in public. Seventy-two percent of Americans said it was important to know \"if the people around me have been vaccinated,\" according to the poll. A majority - 62% - said unvaccinated people should not be allowed to travel on airplanes. Fifty-five percent agreed that unvaccinated people should not work out at public gyms, enter movie theaters or attend public concerts. When asked about the workplace, 60% of Americans said they wanted to work for an employer \"who requires everyone to get a coronavirus vaccine before returning to the office\" and 56% thought unvaccinated workers should stay home. 'DIFFERENT STATUS' Companies could soon feel increasing pressure to address those concerns. About 18% of the U.S. population has already received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine and President Joe Biden said in a televised speech on Thursday night he would direct states to make all adults eligible for the vaccine by May 1. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the poll responses made sense, given the social restrictions placed on everyone over the past year. \"People are saying: 'If I'm vaccinated, it's going to change my life,'\" Adalja said. \"'And if you're not vaccinated, that's your choice. But you're going to be in a different status because you might be a carrier of this virus, so you could spread it to another unvaccinated person.'\" The poll results were somewhat split along party lines. Republicans, who have been generally less concerned than others over the past year about the coronavirus, were also less supportive than Democrats of workplace and lifestyle restrictions for the unvaccinated, according to the poll. Yet even among Republicans, four out of 10 said they supported keeping people without vaccines from going to gyms or movie theaters. Five in 10 Republicans think vaccines should be required for airline travel. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

        "title": "George Floyd's family receives $27 million settlement from Minneapolis over his death",
        "full article": "By Jonathan Allen March 12 (Reuters) - The city of Minneapolis on Friday agreed to pay $27 million to settle a lawsuit by the family of George Floyd over his death in police custody, a case that stirred national protests over racial injustice and police brutality. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in May as Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd's dying pleas for help were captured on widely viewed bystander video, sparking one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, said the agreement was the largest pre-trial settlement of a wrongful death lawsuit in U.S. history. The size signifies that a Black person's death at the hands of police \"will no longer be written off as trivial, unimportant or unworthy of consequences,\" Crump said at a news conference where he was joined by Floyd's relatives, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other officials. Floyd's family was \"pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved,\" his sister Bridgett Floyd said in a statement. \"While our hearts are broken, we are comforted in knowing that even in death, George Floyd showed the world how to live,\" her statement said. The trial of Chauvin, who was fired by the police force, began earlier this week in Hennepin County's district court on charges of murder and manslaughter. Chauvin has pleaded not guilty and said he properly followed his police training. Judge Peter Cahill has set aside about three weeks for jury selection in the high-profile case. Five men and two women had been seated as jurors as of Friday afternoon. Last year, Floyd's relatives sued the city, Chauvin and three other police officers involved in federal court, saying police used excessive force against Floyd in violation of his constitutional rights. Although Frey promised on Friday that the city would be \"unrelenting\" in reforming its police department, it was not clear if the city was admitting wrongdoing as part of the settlement, and city officials did not immediately respond to queries. \"Every American remembers where they were when they first saw it,\" Frey said of the video showing Floyd's death. \"Today's settlement reflects our shared commitment to advancing racial justice.\" The settlement includes a $500,000 contribution from Floyd's family to the community at the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd died, which has been barricaded against police access by residents and is filled with flowers and other tributes to Floyd. Chauvin was helping arrest Floyd on the evening of May 25 on suspicion of his using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at the Cup Foods grocery store at the intersection. The other three officers are due to go on trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin in Floyd's death, which was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. The Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers the day after the deadly arrest.

        "full article": "Arsenal technical director Edu was presenting to the club\u2019s owners this week. He laid out plans to reorganise the club\u2019s worldwide scouting and recruitment operation and compete for the best young talents, as Arsene Wenger and his chief scout Steve Rowley did, in what now seems a different universe.The problem is money. When former chief executive Ivan Gazidis spoke in 2013 of Arsenal becoming a spending power like Bayern Munich, the club were in the midst of a 19-season run in the Champions League.But as the directors congratulated themselves on what a good job they were doing, Arsenal subsided into the second tier of clubs. They\u2019re now blowing a small fortune just to stay there.         Arsenal chief Edu has bold plans to make the club a scouting giant, but money is a problem         In 2013, the Gunners were plotting to become a spending powerhouse like Bayern Munich   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Joe Cole claims Patrick Vieira was one of his toughest...

Arsenal and Tottenham go head-to-head in a mammoth north...    \n\nShare this article\nShare\n5k shares\n\n   Arsenal\u2019s financial results, published last week, revealed the eye-watering detail. After 16 straight profitable years, during which they enjoyed a \u00a3393million surplus, they have reported two successive years of losses, in which a cumulative \u00a386m drained away.As financial analyst Swiss Ramble\u2019s examination of the figures showed, Arsenal now trail other members of the Big Six \u2014 most symbolically Tottenham, who they meet on Sunday.The \u00a317m TV money earned after their last-32 Europa League knockout compared with \u00a369m for Spurs, who sit two places above them in the latest Deloitte Money League having driven \u00a351m more in revenue.         However, Arsenal's slide down the Premier League table has dashed those old ambitions         Their on-field woes are hurting the bank balance, with lack of Champions League a heavy blowArsenal are now outside the top 10 in that league. In 2013 they were sixth, ahead of Manchester City, Liverpool and 13th-placed Spurs. Arsenal are now the second-best north London team for matchday revenue \u2014 a financial realm where once Spurs could not remotely compete. Income is \u00a379m, while Spurs\u2019 new stadium has lifted them to \u00a395m, the Swiss Ramble study shows. Arsenal are eclipsed in all areas: sponsorship, hospitality, merchandise.The Premier League\u2019s 10th-placed club have been fumbling around in the dark for three years, desperately trying to map a route ahead, just like Manchester United after Sir Alex Ferguson left.Hence the revolving door of new executives in that time.              A number of executives have come and go as Arsenal have fumbled in the dark (pictured: former chief executive Ivan Gazidis (left) and former head of recruitment Sven Mislintat)One by one, they have left, for reasons never spelt out. Gazidis, head of recruitment Sven Mislintat, then Darren Burgess, who had been appointed to great fanfare to work as the club\u2019s performance director.Manager Unai Emery\u2019s sacking cost Arsenal \u00a310m. Raul Sanllehi, the head of football, and contract negotiator Huss Fahmy have followed him out the door.Wages soar when panic sets in and here is one field where Arsenal outdo Spurs, with an average \u00a3104,000-a-week offering compared with Tottenham\u2019s \u00a384,249.\u00a0         Edu is hoping that contacts in South America can help land the region's stars of the future\u00a0Profit of \u00a340m from player sales has helped Arsenal. So has cancelling the contracts of Mesut Ozil, Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis Papastathopoulos. A further \u00a316.5m on this season\u2019s wage bill has been staunched by loaning out Sead Kolasinac, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Joe Willock.\u00a0But the Swiss Ramble comparative study shows Arsenal are still running the third-highest losses in the Premier League, surpassed only by Everton (\u00a3175m) and Chelsea (\u00a3112m.)Edu\u2019s PowerPoint presentation is not the only solution being formulated by a club who have received no funding from owner Stan Kroenke in the past five years, at a time when seven sides in the Premier League have been given \u00a3100m or more.\u00a0         But the club will also have to focus on keeping hold of the burgeoning talent they have already including the highly promising Emile Smith Rowe (right)         Folarin Balogun, 19, has impressed a number of suitors in Germany but has had limited minutes         The financial headache could have a huge effect on Mikel Arteta's transfer budget this summer        KEOWN: STOP GIFTING GOALS, GUNNERS! I said at half-time in Arsenal v Olympiacos that if they were going to slip up in this tie, it would come courtesy of an error they made themselves.It had been one of the most convincing first halves we\u2019d seen from Mikel Arteta\u2019s side in Europe. Then, in the 58th minute, they went from a position of comfortable possession to giving a goal away.Bernd Leno played an unwise pass into Dani Ceballos, Olympiacos took the ball and scored. Arsenal cannot afford to keep making these mistakes. It needs addressing.Arteta likes to build from the back and doesn\u2019t want his players to fear this philosophy. But it\u2019s about picking the right moment and right passes. It\u2019s risk and reward.They cannot continue to be their own worst enemy, especially not in a match of such magnitude on Sunday.Whenever Arsenal and Tottenham meet, serious bragging rights are at stake.They got the Olympiacos job done in the end, despite allowing the Greek side back into the game. Now play smart \u2014 and don\u2019t go offering Tottenham any gifts.\u00a0 Advertisement\n It is thought Edu\u2019s contacts in Brazil and Argentina will help the pursuit of teenage prospects who, with senior games behind them early, pose fewer visa complications. Contacts in France and Spain going back to the Wenger era remain strong.\u00a0Incoming head of football operations Richard Garlick will be part of a set-up designed to ensure panic contracts for Ozil (\u00a3350,000 a week) and Willian (\u00a3200,000 a week) are consigned to the past.Under Mikel Arteta, Arsenal\u2019s academy is coming to the fore again.The club are interested in Brighton\u2019s Tariq Lamptey and will look to extend the contracts of Folarin Balogun, 19, and Emile Smith Rowe, 20.But pressure is on to convince Arsenal\u2019s young players there is a route to first-team football.Liverpool have been looking at those youngsters about to fall out of contract, as have German clubs. Bayer Leverkusen and Stuttgart are monitoring Balogun.From the outside, some of the 55 non-playing redundancies designed to stem financial losses looked baffling and ill-judged.They included popular supporter liaison officer Mark Brindle, who communicates with the club\u2019s 250 fan groups.After a protest to chief executive Vinai Venkatesham by the Arsenal Supporters\u2019 Trust, Brindle is now staying.The episode demonstrated the uneasy path Arsenal are treading to balance the books.Arteta was pressed hard before the Europa League match against Olympiacos on how much of a problem financial losses could prove come the summer transfer window.\u2018We don\u2019t know yet because we have so many things to do,\u2019 he said. \u2018Everything we are planning is for this club to go back to being sustainable.\u2019   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Joe Cole claims Patrick Vieira was one of his toughest...

        "title": "Jofra Archer admits elbow injury remains an issue after starring in England win",
        "full article": "Jofra Archer proved he had enough fitness, form and firepower to help England kick off their Twenty20 series against India with a resounding win, but admitted his troublesome right elbow was still holding him back. Archer missed two matches in the recent Test series due to recurring pain in the joint but he was more than able to make his presence felt across four high-class overs in Ahmedabad, taking three for 23 as India were kept to a modest 124 for seven. That was nowhere near enough to hold back the tourists, for whom Jason Roy top-scored with 49 in a regulation eight-wicket victory, and Archer was later named player-of-the-match for his efforts. The paceman, starting in the powerplay and finishing off at the business end of the India innings, did not concede a run from 16 of his 24 deliveries and got the best of KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya and Shardul Thakur along the way. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to help in a win to be honest. When the competition\u2019s tough you have to step up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings out the best in me. If get one or I get three, the way I bowl doesn\u2019t change, it just depends on how your luck is at the time.\u201d          Jofra Archer put in a player-of-the-match performance against India (Aijaz Rahi/AP)  England know that Archer has a good deal more than luck to offer as they build towards their twin goals of the T20 World Cup and the Ashes tour later this year. But it is almost certain that his elbow will require further careful management and he was clear that his strong performance on Friday was not the result of any wondrous overnight recovery. My boy\u2764\ufe0f @CJordan pic.twitter.com/UtzXxEHWGz\u2014 Jofra Archer (@JofraArcher) March 12, 2021   Asked how it felt after his exertions, he said: \u201cSame as it has been since we got to India. We are all on the same page: I came to them (during the Test series) and said it\u2019s not feeling right at the moment and I didn\u2019t have to say it twice, they automatically jumped on it and we started making plans. \u201cI need to take care of my elbow before I think about what is going to happen. For me, in the immediate, I want to get through this series and then I will do everything in my power to make sure I\u2019m going to the World Cup and the Ashes.\u201d It was telling that he appeared ready to concede his once fiercely-guarded pace rivalry with team-mate Mark Wood, though. The latter cleared 93mph and was consistently rapid as he took one for 20 in a stirring middle-overs role. \u201cI still try to out pace him but I don\u2019t think I am in the best position to do it at the moment,\u201d Archer said with a smile. \u201cBut I still try to cheer him, still to try to wind him up a bit. It was good to see his performance \u2013 to see the ball carrying through and see the speed gun.\u201d England captain Eoin Morgan could have asked Wood to share the new ball with Archer, but instead sprung a surprise by handing the job to leg-spinner Adil Rashid. \u261d\ufe0f KL Rahul\u261d\ufe0f Virat KohliIndia have lost two big wickets inside the first three overs.

Rash is a world-class bowler and he can bowl anywhere,\u201d said Archer. \u201c(Kohli) is obviously a dangerous batter and to see the back of him early so many times is a real bonus. I think it probably might have dampened their camp a little bit.\u201d",

        "full article": "The city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay 27 million dollars (\u00a319.4 million) to settle a civil lawsuit from George Floyd\u2019s family over the black man\u2019s death in police custody. The Minneapolis City Council emerged from a closed session to announce the settlement, which includes 500,000 dollars for the neighbourhood where Mr Floyd was arrested. Mr Floyd was declared dead on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a former officer who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Mr Floyd\u2019s death sparked violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. Mr Floyd\u2019s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Mr Floyd\u2019s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called it the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim, and thanked city leaders for \u201cshowing you care about George Floyd\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long journey to justice. This is just one step on the journey to justice,\u201d Mr Crump said. \u201cThis makes a statement that George Floyd deserved better than what we witnessed on May 25, 2020, that George Floyd\u2019s life mattered, and that by extension, Black lives matter.\u201d \u201cEven though my brother is not here, he\u2019s here with me in my heart,\u201d Philonise Floyd said. \u201cIf I could get him back, I would give all this back.\u201d Chris Stewart, another attorney who worked with the family, said the size of the settlement \u201cchanges evaluations and civil rights for a black person when they die\u201d. \u201cAnd what happens is that trickles down to decisions in the communities across this country. When there is a city council or a mayor deciding, \u2018Oh, should we get rid of no-knock warrants, should we get rid of chokeholds, do we want to change these policies?\u2019 They have 27 million reasons now why they should. And that will make decisions happen. That will make accountability happen.\u201d",

It was previously said that shades were controlled by one or two genes, with brown eyes typically dominating blueThe study, led by King's College London and Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, is deemed to be 'the largest genetic study of its kind to date.'Co-senior author Dr Manfred Kayser, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, said: 'This study delivers the genetic knowledge needed to improve eye color prediction from DNA as already applied in anthropological and forensic studies, but with limited accuracy for the non-brown and non-blue eye colors.'

These findings will help to improve the understanding of eye diseases such as pigmentary glaucoma and ocular albinism, where eye pigment levels play a role'Moreover, we also identified 34 genetic loci that were significantly associated with eye color, but for which there is no report of significant association with hair and/or skin color,' researchers state.These findings will help to improve the understanding of eye diseases such as pigmentary glaucoma and ocular albinism, where eye pigment levels play a role.Co-senior author Dr Pirro Hysi, King's, said: 'The findings are exciting because they bring us to a step closer to understanding the genes that cause one of the most striking features of the human faces, which has mystified generations throughout our history.''This will improve our understanding of many diseases that we know are associated with specific pigmentation levels.'The color of our eyes has always been a mysterious wonder and is usually a surprise at birth.However, new technologies are allowing humans to choose\u00a0 the shade of a babies eyes, along with other abilities and features.A form of gene editing called CRISPR is already being used by scientists in China to alter disease-causing genetic mutations in human embryos.\u00a0And a study in 2018 revealed 39 percent of people would alter their unborn child's DNA to select their eye color. ABOUT COLOUR BLINDNESS   Approximately one in 20 people suffer from colour blindness, a condition that makes the world a duller place to look at.According to the NHS, it affects 1 in 200 women in the world and 1 in 12 men.There are four kinds of colour blindness known as protanopia, dueteranopia, tritanopia and achromatopsia.ProtanopiaProtanopia involves defective or absent long-wavelength cones in the retina; these photoreceptor cones are responsible for the perception of red light. Protans find it difficult to distinguish between red and green colours, and also between blue and green.DeuteranopiaDeuteranopia is a condition where the green photoreceptor cone is missing from the retina. As a result, it is much harder for deutans to distinguish green from red, as well as some greys, purples and a greenish blue. Along with protanopia this is one of the most common forms of colour blindness.TritanopiaTritanopia is a complete lack of the short-wavelength cones in the retina that receive blue light. People with this very rare form of colour blindness confuse light blues with greys, dark purples with black, mid-greens with blues and oranges with reds.AchromatopsiaPeople with total acromatopsia cannot perceive any colours at all and can only observe the world in black and white and shades of grey.The retina of the eye has two types of light-sensitive cells; rods and cones.Both are found the layer at the back of your eye which processes images.Rods work in low light conditions, but cones work in daylight and are responsible for colour. People who have colour blindness have a problem with the cones in their retina.\u00a0 Advertisement",

        "full article": "By Marta Nogueira RIO DE JANEIRO, March 12 (Reuters) - Global miners such as Brazil's Vale, Anglo American PLc and Chile's Codelco said they expect demand for copper to strengthen in coming years on growing demand for environmentally friendly cars, while the mining industry reckons with questions about its own sustainability. Mining executives said during a webinar about copper on Friday that higher demand for the metal was an opportunity for the industry to improve its image by adopting more socially-conscious practices. \"The society will not tolerate the way we operated before,\" said Ruben Fernandes, base metals CEO for Anglo American PLc, adding the industry now had an opportunity to build alliances with governments and populations to improve its image. Two Vale SA dam bursts in a four-year period killed hundreds of people and caused extensive environmental damage in Brazil's Minas Gerais state, drawing attention to issues of safety and risk. Elsewhere, the industry is grappling with pollution, deforestation and labor disputes. Fernandes said it remained unclear whether copper was entering a new \"super cycle\" as the metal reached the highest prices in almost a decade in London this week. Mark Travers, Vale's base metals director, said the company's copper projects had synergies with its iron ore operations, with shared infrastructure. Travers said the higher demand for copper was an \"opportunity to do the right thing and work with local communities\", adopting sustainable practices. Vale CEO Eduardo Bartolomeo recently said the company had a bullish outlook for the metal and intended to accelerate copper projects in the Carajas region, in the state of Para, where Vale has its largest iron ore mines. Later, in a separate session, Juan Benevides, chairman of Chile's Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, said he expected demand for copper to keep rising over the next three to four years.

        "full article": "By Nandita Bose WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio on Friday became the first high-profile Republican lawmaker to support a growing push to unionize Amazon.com Inc workers in Alabama, after several Democratic lawmakers visited the company's facility last week. In an opinion piece in USA Today, Rubio wrote that Amazon has \"waged a war against working-class values\" and is \"looking to crush the union vote\" in Bessemer, Alabama. \"Here's my standard: When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy - I support the workers. And that's why I stand with those at Amazon's Bessemer warehouse today.\" Rubio's backing is noteworthy as Republicans traditionally favor businesses and investors looking to squelch unionizing efforts. Amazon workers at the Alabama facility began voting by mail in February on whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) and become the first group of U.S. Amazon employees to unionize. The union's President Stuart Appelbaum welcomed the support from Rubio and said this fight \"should not be a partisan issue.\" President Joe Biden also recently expressed support for the Amazon warehouse employees and defended workers' rights to form unions. Last week, Democratic U.S. Representatives Andy Levin, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Terri Sewell and Nikema Williams visited the facility and met workers and organizers. An Amazon spokesperson said \"when Senator Rubio says Amazon is 'waging war on working class values,' does he mean our $15 starting wage, comprehensive benefits, or the paid parental leave we provide for hourly workers?.\" Rubio's column did not address Amazon's wages or benefits. It said Amazon \"uses anticompetitive strategies to crush small businesses, bans conservative books and blocks traditional charities from participating in its AmazonSmile program.\" Amazon offers $15 an hour minimum wage to its workers and has continued to advocate for the federal minimum wage to be raised to that level. Rubio has clashed with Amazon before, as part of a group of conservative lawmakers who wrote to the online retailer in February after it stopped selling a book that Amazon said framed transgender and other sexual identities as mental illnesses. The pressure on Amazon has also continued to mount from other areas in Washington. On Friday, Senator Bernie Sanders invited Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, to appear before his Senate Budget panel for a hearing on income and wealth inequality. The Amazon spokesperson said \"Jeff is unable to attend the hearing\" but that the company supports the senator's efforts to reduce income inequality.

        "full article": "By Jonathan Stempel March 12 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has been sued by a shareholder who accused him of violating his 2018 settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his Twitter use. According to a complaint unsealed late Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court, which also names the electric car company's board as defendants, Musk's \"erratic\" tweets and the failure of Tesla directors to ensure he complied with the SEC settlement have exposed shareholders to billions of dollars of losses. The complaint highlighted several Musk posts on social media platform Twitter, including his assessment last May 1 that Tesla's stock price was \"too high,\" prompting a more than $13 billion tumble in Tesla's market value. Chase Gharrity, the plaintiff, said Musk's actions and the directors' inaction have caused \"substantial financial harm,\" and that they should pay damages to Palo Alto, California-based Tesla for breaching their fiduciary duties. The lawsuit was filed even though Tesla's share price has soared nearly fivefold since Musk's \"too high\" tweet, giving Tesla a valuation well above $600 billion, and the SEC has not publicly accused Musk of recent violations. \"It could pressure the SEC into taking some sort of recourse,\" said Charles Elson, a University of Delaware professor and corporate governance specialist. Tesla did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. Gharrity's lawyers, Musk's lawyers in the SEC case, and the SEC did not immediately respond to similar requests. The SEC settlement followed Musk's August 2018 tweet that he had \"funding secured\" to possibly take Tesla private in a $72 billion transaction. In reality, Musk was not close. Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines, and Tesla lawyers agreed to vet some of Musk's tweets in advance. The settlement was later amended to clarify when pre-approvals were required, prompted by a unvetted tweet by Musk about Tesla's vehicle production forecast. Last April, a San Francisco federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit claiming Musk's going-private tweet defrauded shareholders. That case remains pending. The case is Gharrity v Musk et al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 2021-0199.

Morgan, a former tabloid editor and CNN presenter, left his high-profile job on ITV's \"Good Morning Britain\" this week after a backlash against his comments on the interview, in which Meghan revealed she had felt suicidal while living as a royal in Britain. In an interview that has shaken Britain's monarchy, Meghan, who married Prince Harry in 2018, said the royal family had also rejected her pleas for mental health support. The morning after the interview was aired on U.S. television, Morgan said on \"Good Morning Britain\", among a torrent of other criticisms, that he did not believe a word Meghan had said. In a Tweet, he called her \"Princess Pinocchio\". Monday's programme attracted more than 41,000 complaints to Britain's media regulator Ofcom, the second highest in its history, which announced an investigation. Media reports said the couple had also complained to broadcaster ITV. \"We can confirm receipt of a standards complaint made on behalf of the Duchess of Sussex,\" a spokesman for Ofcom said on Friday, in reference to Meghan's official title. Meghan and Harry have clashed repeatedly with Britain's media, particularly the tabloid newspapers which they have accused of bigotry and invading their privacy.

        "title": "El Salvador awaits what president will do with new power",
        "full article": "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) - El Salvador President Nayib Bukele\u00b4s New Ideas party dominated every aspect of this month's national elections and will take control of congress and the majority of the country\u00b4s municipalities. What remains unclear is what it will do with that power. The new legislature won\u00b4t be seated until May, but so far the top priority voiced by the party has been Bukele\u00b4s refrain, repeated by New Ideas candidates throughout its campaign: Remove the corrupt. The party\u00b4s more specific hints focus on erasing the grip that El Salvador\u00b4s traditional parties have held on power for almost three decades. Carolina Recinos, coordinator of Bukele\u00b4s cabinet, said the administration will push \"a profound electoral reform\" so that political parties don't run the Supreme Electoral Court. Party candidates also campaigned to loosen their control over the Accounts Court, essentially a national auditor. Bukele has asked Vice President F\u00e9lix Ulloa to form a commission of lawyers to evaluate proposals for constitutional reforms to be presented to the new legislature. New Ideas won 56 of 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly, giving Bukele\u00b4s party a two-thirds majority. That will let it select the new attorney general, justices for the Supreme Court and human rights prosecutor - essentially all the key domestic critics of Bukele's allegedly authoritarian tendencies.          President Nayib Bukele holds his ballots as he prepares to vote in local and legislative elections, at a polling station in San Salvador, El Salvador, Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021. El Salvador went to the polls in legislative and mayoral elections that could break the congressional deadlock that has tied the hands of President Nayib Bukele. (AP Photo/Salvador Melendez)  The oft-repeated call for ousting corrupt officials has kept Bukele\u00b4s popularity extremely high. \"I hope that (Bukele) keeps all of his promises, that they strip the deputies of their immunity, that they finish off the shameless,\" said Mar\u00eda Catalina Espinoza, a 42-year-old homemaker who was grocery shopping in downtown San Salvador this week. \"We\u00b4re tired of so much corruption.\" Bukele leapt from mayor of El Salvador's capital to the presidency in 2019 by campaigning almost exclusively on rooting out endemic corruption. His rise was made possible by the repeated scandals of the conservative National Republican Alliance and its leftist counterpart, the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, where Bukele got his start. Those parties, which had dominated El Salvador\u00b4s politics since the end of the 12-year civil war in 1992, had lost credibility in the eyes of the public. But that largely two-party system also had maintained some degree of rigor in El Salvador\u00b4s democratic institutions. With Bukele\u00b4s allies on the verge of controlling all three branches of government, many fear that El Salvador\u00b4s system of checks and balances could be in danger. The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, in particular, had blocked some of Bukele\u00b4s aggressive lockdown orders it said only the congress had authority to enact. Now his party will have the votes to select Supreme Court justices, including the court\u00b4s president, who also presides over the Constitutional Chamber. Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, said that while Bukele is a legitimately elected president with solid support, \"his authoritarian tendencies and the weakening of any control on his power are reason for great concern.\" In February last year, Bukele sent armed troops to surround Congress to pressure lawmakers to pass a loan for security funding. In June, the Supreme Court\u00b4s Constitutional Chamber ruled that Bukele\u00b4s obligatory stay-at-home measure to slow the spread of COVID-19 was unconstitutional. The president lashed out at the justices repeatedly. \"The court has just ordered us to murder dozens of thousands of Salvadorans within five days,\" he wrote on Twitter. Political analyst Dagoberto Guti\u00e9rrez, a former guerrilla commander who signed the 1992 peace accords, said El Salvador urgently needs reforms to the educational, health and tax system and to how its democracy function. He said Bukele must start \"where the people suffer most,\" with issues such as unemployment and poverty. That raises the question of whether the administration\u00b4s attention to the courts, potential constitutional reforms and stripping opponents of power will satisfy a population with more pressing concerns. The Biden administration already appears to be taking a more wary approach than that of former President Donald Trump, whose focus on slowing migration from Central America led the U.S. to turn a blind eye to issues of corruption and other worrying signs. When Bukele made a quick trip to Washington after Biden\u00b4s inauguration, administration officials declined meetings. Bukele has denied that he sought meetings. Leonor Arteaga, program director at the Due Process of Law Foundation, a regional rule of law organization based in Washington, spoke of both opportunities and dangers facing Bukele during a panel discussion this week. \"Nayib Bukele has transformed the Salvadoran electoral landscape by challenging El Salvador\u00b4s political institutions and norms, and some change is important and it\u00b4s healthy,\" Arteaga said. But she warned the power could easily be used \"for the purpose of installing a new elite in El Salvador that would use the state and state resources for their own purposes.\" She said his broad support will lead to great demands for change, which could be a challenge. \"He has the opportunity to make things different because this popular support will not last forever and he should not waste this opportunity to transform El Salvador.\"          President Nayib Bukele holds up his marked finger after voting, as he poses with his wife Gabriela Rodriguez de Bukele at a polling station during local and legislative elections, in San Salvador, El Salvador, Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021.

        "title": "Science helps people hold leaders to account, Britain\u00b4s first astronaut says",
        "full article": "Being aware of science allows people to hold leaders to account and is an essential part of a democracy, Britain\u2019s first astronaut has said. Dr Helen Sharman said the world is changing quickly and science can be an integral part of solving the big issues such as climate change. She is supporting Thales Alenia Space\u2019s MARSBalloon project which will launch more than 150 experiment capsules designed by UK schoolchildren into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Dr Sharman told the PA news agency: \u201cThe world\u2019s changing really rapidly and I think it\u2019s going to be Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) opportunities that are going to form, I think, the vast majority of those jobs out there in the future for young people. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t have to do Stem and to get involved in space. \u201cBut actually, I think Stem subjects will give you a lot of opportunities that you can\u2019t imagine right now, just like I went into space and never imagined that my degree in chemistry would take me there.\u201d          Dr Helen Sharman (Anthony Devlin/PA)  According to a survey commissioned by Thales Alenia Space, in the UK the pandemic has inspired more than a third (35%) of children to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Most are inspired to be doctors or nurses (29%) and astronauts (25%). Dr Sharman said that over the last year science had become part of everyday life and people had seen that it can solve problems and make an impact. She told PA: \u201cYoung people are interested in all sorts of things in their life. And they\u2019re really interested as well in some of those big issues, and we know that young people are very, very interested in things like climate change.\u201d She added: \u201cThings like climate change, of course, the pandemic as well \u2013 all of these things are big deals that young people realise science can be integral in solving. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve climate change without science.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is vital that young people are involved in that (science) because they are our future, and they will help to solve these big issues in the future. \u201cBut even more than that. I think if we all take on board aspects of science, it means that we integrate science into our lives, we\u2019re not scared of it, we don\u2019t mind asking questions. \u201cAnd we can ask questions to find out the answer, but we can also ask questions of our leaders, we can hold them to account, make sure that our leaders make the right decisions for the whole world. \u201cWhich of course then brings us right back to the climate change issue and making sure that the leaders aren\u2019t just going gung-ho after one particular aspect of something they\u2019re interested in, but we want them to make the right decisions for everybody on this planet. \u201cSo I think yes, science is really important \u2013 it\u2019s about being part of a democracy, as much as there\u2019s opportunities in life later on.\u201d In 1989 Dr Sharman became the first British astronaut when she was selected for the joint UK-Soviet Union mission Juno. However, she explained that there are a lot of jobs in the space industry, and children can start getting involved now by taking part in the MARSBalloon project, which begins registration on April 1. Dr Sharman said: \u201cIt\u2019s the role (astronaut) that a lot of people want but few people will actually end up getting. \u201cBut I think that it\u2019s not just the astronauts but the whole aspect of spaceflight is interesting and human spaceflight particularly because the children are thinking about how they would feel if they were there. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean to say that actually they\u2019re only interested in it if they can be astronauts.\u201d",

Mohsin and Zuber Issa completed the purchase of Asda from Walmart in February, but the takeover has to be investigated by the competitions watchdog before it can be formally put throughThe competitions watchdog started investigating the deal last December, with an outcome expected by April 20.The investigation does not include potential hairdresser businesses within the supermarket's sites.The children of immigrants who moved to Blackburn from Gujurat, India, in the 1970s, Mohsin and Zuber now have franchise agreements with brands including Starbucks, Subway and KFC.\u00a0   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's vow to refuse...

        "full article": "BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) - Right-hander Trevor Cahill and the Pittsburgh Pirates have finalized a $1.5 million, one-year contract, a deal that allows him to earn an additional $1 million in performance bonuses for innings. The team announced the signing on Friday, giving a very young pitching staff an experienced voice. The 33-year-old Cahill went 1-2 with a 3.24 ERA last season while pitching for the San Francisco Giants. Cahill began the season in the starting rotation but moved to the bullpen in mid-September. Cahill struck out 31 and walked 14 in 24 innings, holding opponents to a career-low .184 batting average. After moving to the bullpen, he pitched five shutout innings in five games. Cahill is 85-94 with a 4.20 ERA in 352 career appearances (225 starts) with with Oakland (2009-11, \u00b418), Arizona (2012, \u00b414), Atlanta (2015), the Chicago Cubs (2015-16), San Diego (2017), Kansas City (2017), the Los Angeles Angels (2019) and San Francisco (2020). He was an All-Star in 2010 with Oakland, finishing ninth in Cy Young voting that year after posting an 18-8 mark. Cahill began his career as a starter but has filled multiple roles in recent seasons. He\u00b4s made 55 starts and 111 relief appearances since 2015. Cahill could earn $100,000 for 75 innings, $150,000 for 100, $200,000 for 125, $250,000 for 150 and $300,000 for 175. He earned $519,624 in prorated pay from a $2 million salary. Pittsburgh placed right-hander Blake Cederlind on the 60-day injured list to open a roster spot. Cederlind injured his ulnar collateral ligament during Wednesday night\u00b4s exhibition against the Yankees in Tampa and is discussing treatment, according to the Pirates. During that game, Cederlind hit Robinson Chirinos with a pitch, breaking Chirinos\u00b4 right wrist. ___ More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "full article": "By Gabriela Baczynska BRUSSELS, March 12 (Reuters) - European Union COVID-19 certificates intended to free up travel must prevent discrimination against those not vaccinated by including information on whether people have been tested or have recovered, according to a draft document seen by Reuters. The European Commission is expected to release its final proposal for COVID-19 \"green digital certificates\" next week, with southern countries reliant on tourism hoping they will open up this year's summer season. But they ran into opposition from countries including Germany and Belgium, which said vaccination is neither obligatory nor currently available to all those willing to accept it. While the proposal aims to \"facilitate free movement\" during the pandemic, it says any proof of vaccination must not discriminate against those who refuse the shot or cannot get inoculated. It remained unclear how this would work in practice, as member states would still need to decide how people who did not have evidence of vaccination would be treated if they wished to cross frontiers. The draft also leaves it up to the 27 member states to make a call on waiving travel restrictions only for those vaccinated with shots authorized for the whole bloc by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or also for people who received jabs allowed unilaterally by specific countries. Hungary and Slovakia have already bought the Russian Sputnik vaccine despite it not being authorized by the EMA. The agency has recommended four Western vaccines for use so far. With competing goals for the proposed COVID-19 certificates, EU leaders - much criticized for a slow vaccination roll-out - are expected to have a heated discussion on the proposal later this month.

        "full article": "LAGOS, March 12 (Reuters) - Nigeria has not increased gasoline pump prices, its fuel regulator said on Friday, after sparking confusion at fuel stations and a public backlash by apparently flagging a big rise was on the cards. \"There is no price increase. The current (gasoline) price is being maintained while consultations are being concluded,\" the Petroleum Products Pricing Agency (PPPRA) said in a statement. On Thursday, the regulator posted an online notice listing the \"guiding price\" for \"ex-depot\", or wholesale, gasoline at 206.42 naira per litre - well above the previous pump prices of around 167 naira. After local media reported the post, some consumers flocked to fuel stations, prompting a sharp rise in prices at some, and others to stop selling amid the confusion. In Lagos, at least two stations were charging 248 naira per litre, compared with 167 naira on Thursday. Nigeria is struggling to balance a promise to eliminate costly fuel subsidies with public anger over more expensive fuel. Oil prices have risen about 25% since the beginning of February, but state oil company NNPC vowed prices would not increase in March, meaning that it could be losing millions daily on gasoline imports. Following the public backlash - and statements from NNPC, the petroleum minister and a presidential spokesman that higher prices were not approved - PPPRA removed its post about the guidance for ex-depot prices. NNPC is currently the only gasoline importer due to the state-controlled ex-depot price that is keeping levels artificially low. It has said it is consulting with unions to agree a formula that allows gasoline prices to float, but still protects consumers. In mid February, fuel marketers estimated gasoline was costing NNPC some 1.2 billion naira ($3.2 million) per day, a huge risk to government finances. Eliminating subsidies was among conditions for a $1.5 billion World Bank budget support loan.

        "full article": "Mike Smith had 18 points and a Big Ten tournament-record 15 assists as No. 4 Michigan pulled away to a 79-66 victory over Maryland in a heated quarterfinal game at Indianapolis on Friday. Michigan coach Juwan Howard and Maryland coach Mark Turgeon exchanged words during a timeout midway through the second half. Howard had to be restrained by his assistants and was assessed a double technical, resulting in his ejection. Turgeon was assessed one technical. Franz Wagner and Eli Brooks contributed 16 points apiece for the top-seeded Wolverines (20-3). Chaundee Brown Jr. added 10 points and Austin Davis chipped in six points and eight rebounds. Eric Ayala led eighth-seeded Maryland (16-13) with 19 points. Darryl Morsell supplied 16 points, six rebounds and three assists and Aaron Wiggins had 11 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Michigan had an 11-2 run early in the second half to gain a 51-42 lead. Hunter Dickinson converted a pair of layups and Smith knocked down a pair of jumpers, including a 3-pointer. Wagner completed the run with a layup. Morsell scored five straight points to cut the Wolverines' lead to four. Brooks and Wagner then made 3-pointers to push Michigan's lead back to 57-47. Following Howard's ejection, the Terrapins scored five straight points to cut the Wolverines' lead in half. The Wolverines responded with an 8-0 run, including five points from Brooks, to make it 65-52 with 7:23 remaining. After Maryland closed the gap to six points, Smith put the game away during a 9-0 Michigan spurt. He set up a Brown basket, then made a 3-point shot. He tacked on two free throws and a mid-range jumper for a 76-61 Wolverines lead. The Terrapins were up 36-24 with less than five minutes remaining in the opening half. The Wolverines ended the half with a 16-2 outburst to gain a 40-38 lead. Smith was the catalyst, as he dished out four of his nine first-half assists during that span along with making two free throws. His interior pass to Wagner for a layup in the closing seconds put Michigan on top. --Field Level Media",

        "full article": "The temptation to make an airline-style 'cabin doors to manual' announcement was almost overwhelming.For it is the wide open space between the doors that strikes you first with Mazda's new family and fun focussed MX-30 crossover which goes on sale this week.The wide-opening 'freestyle' or clam-shell doors of perception swing open in the opposite direction to one another creating a disconcertingly huge gap where the sides of the five-door five-seater SUV normally are.         Mind the gap: Mazda's new family-focused MX-30\u00a0 features a pillar-less designThe front doors of the MX-30 are hinged conventionally at the front. But the rear doors are hinged at the back, allowing access to the rear bench seat. And when that happens there's no visible central pillar. So with all the doors open you can look right through the car.It's a style already used on Mazda's earlier 2003 RX-8 sports coupe, as well as on the Rolls-Royce Phantom limousine (though it has a central pillar) and \u2013 on one one-side only - by MINI with its Clubman, BMW's i3. And of course, a London cab.Back in the far distant olden days - when many a car's front and/or rear door were hinged at the back like this - they were known rather grimly as 'suicide doors' because of the risk that opening one while underway and against the direction of travel could result in the driver or passenger being sucked out.

And if that is attempted while the car is driving, the vehicle will come to a stop.For the record, that elusive central pillar is cunningly hidden in the frame of the rear door, so maintains structural integrity when the doors are closed.The new Mazda MX-30 is Mazda's first all-electric car and the Japanese car firm's first to achieve a top 5-star EuroNCAP crash-test safety rating under more stringent 2020 regime.       Having seen it unveiled at the 2019 Tokyo Motor Show (remember those pre-Covid days when you could still travel abroad?), I recently drove an early production model on UK roads.Sitting quite high on its 18-inch wheels but with low-slung looks and a commanding seating position, it's a sprightly and engaging drive with nimble handling and dynamic pace.It has stylishly distinctive looks and some neat design and eco-friendly touches including the clean dashboard, contemporary fabric seats, and recycled bottles used in the doors.

On a fast charger it will do up to 80 per cent in 36 minutes.The big compromise with a smaller battery is on range which, at 124 miles, marks it as a city or commuter car \u2013 great for short hops and round-trips, but requiring forward planning and re-charging pit-stops for longer journeys , adding to the hassle factor when public charging points may be scarce or out of action.\u00a0That range is less than rivals such as the Renault Zoe (245 miles), Peugeot e-208 (211 miles) and Nissan LEAF (194 miles), and even those already having range identified as a limiting factor such as the Honda-e (136 miles) and MINI Electric (136 miles).With custom-designed hinges, the front doors open forwards to an angle of up to 82\u00b0 and rear doors backwards, to 80\u00b0. This \u2013and the absence of a central pillar - allows easy entry to and exit from both front and rear seats.The rear door trim also incorporates a vertical grip that makes it easier to open and close the door easier, with less stress on the wrist, even with the door wide open.Front seats are equipped with a 'walk-in' mechanism that, with a single touch, folds the seatback forward and simultaneously slides the whole seat toward the front.This makes entry and exit from the rear seats easier.Managing director of Mazda Motors UK, Jeremy Thomson, said: 'Our first all-electric Mazda heralds an exciting start to Mazda's second century in business.'

        "full article": "MARSEILLE, France (AP) - Stefanos Tsitsipas' bid to win a third straight Open 13 fizzled out when he lost to doubles specialist Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-2 in the quarterfinals on Friday. Herbert has a career Grand Slam in doubles but in singles is ranked 93rd, compared to fifth for the Australian Open semifinalist Tsitsipas. But the clean-serving Frenchman turned the tables on the big-serving Greek by effectively using serve and volley on the indoor hard-court. He hit eight aces to two, won 79% of his first serves compared to 64% for second-seeded Tsitsipas, and clinched victory with a smart backhand volley at the net. Herbert dropped his serve twice but broke Tsitsipas five times for the best win in a singles career in which he's lost more than half of his matches. A French finalist is guaranteed, too, since Herbert plays fourth-seeded Ugo Humbert. He won 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4) against Arthur Rinderknech, a qualifier ranked 138th. Earlier, second-seeded Daniil Medvedev made light work of reaching the semis in brushing aside fifth-seeded Jannik Sinner 6-2, 6-4. The imposing Russian saved the only break point he faced and broke the Italian player's serve three times at the indoor tournament. The Australian Open runner-up has won 21 of his last 23 matches and will climb to second in the ATP rankings next week. \"It is my first time here in the semifinals in Marseille ... I was on top of the match the whole time,\" Medvedev said. \"Jannik always tries to hit the ball as hard as he can. You cannot give him easy balls, otherwise you are going to run all over the place and he is probably going to hit a winner.\" When the two-time Grand Slam runner-up climbs to No. 2 on Monday, he will be the first outside the Big Four of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - to do so since Nadal in July 2005. Medvedev is chasing a 10th career title and next faces qualifier Matthew Ebden, who at No. 287 became the lowest-ranked semifinalist in the tournament's 28-year history. Setting the tone for upsets, the Australian downed third-seeded Karen Khachanov 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, breaking the Russian four times. ___ More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

It is a bit like when you have a satisfying meal \u2013 you get comfortable, and I\u2019m not a comfortable human. \u201cI\u2019m not one who settles for anything other than extraordinary from everybody around me. The bar is high.\u201d Chelsea are seen as strong favourites for Sunday\u2019s contest against a Bristol City outfit lying second-bottom of the WSL. Hayes said: \u201cI\u2019ve played on both sides \u2013 I\u2019ve been the underdog and I\u2019ve been the favourite. I\u2019m happy being the favourite. I think it\u2019s where the group is at. They accept the responsibility that comes with being here at this club. \u201cBut I know what I\u2019m like \u2013 I don\u2019t rest my mind about these things, and I\u2019m not complacent. I think my background makes sure of that. \u201cMy feet are on the floor. I\u2019ve learned that when for just one moment you underestimate an opponent, that\u2019s it, finished.\u201d Bristol City\u2019s five league games so far under interim boss Matt Beard include a 5-0 home defeat to Chelsea last month, but they have also secured seven points, and moved off the bottom of the table with a 3-2 win over Reading on Monday. Hayes, who thinks the Robins will stay up, said: \u201cYou could probably cite millions of games in history, from Wimbledon back in the day, Wigan, an underdog when they won (the men\u2019s FA Cup) \u2013 that is what cups are about, one-off events. \u201cThere is no doubt we have more experience of being in this position than them, but they have all the freedom of knowing they don\u2019t have that pressure and expectation, they can just go and play and enjoy themselves. \u201cAnd off the back of their game (on Monday) there is no doubt that team will come out and play with the mentality Matt has instilled in them.\u201d Beard, Hayes\u2019 predecessor at Chelsea, took temporary charge at Bristol City in January until the end of the season, coming in as maternity cover for boss Tanya Oxtoby, whose baby is due this month. Oxtoby is set to be in attendance on Sunday. Hayes, pregnant when her team won the FA Cup in 2018, said when asked about Oxtoby: \u201cI think you have to really appreciate how tough this might be for her. She\u2019s at home pregnant while her team is winning and doing well under another manager. \u201cI said to her it is so important you let go to that process and try to find the best way to enjoy not only them excelling, which she does, but that you\u2019ve played a major part in that. She deserves to be there. \u201cI got to lead my team out at Wembley eight days, or maybe two weeks, before I gave birth. I would just encourage her to sit down, enjoy it as best she can and take pride that she\u2019s done an incredible amount of work to get the team into that position, along with Matt.\u201d",

        "full article": "SANTIAGO, March 12 (Reuters) - Chilean authorities on Friday said they had confiscated more than three tonnes of cocaine and marihuana wrapped in white paper stamped with the image of deceased Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. The Escobar-decorated packages were a first in Chile, authorities said, though similar shipments were confiscated by police along the Mosquito coast of Honduras earlier this year. \"Criminal organizations always put a stamp on (their product), something distinctive, for traceability, to ensure that large shipments reach their destination,\" said Hector Espinosa, director general of Chile's PDI investigative police. The bust - unusually large for Chile - also resulted in the arrest of six people, the seizure of 14 vehicles, various weapons, foreign currency and several cellphones. The drugs were seized in Chile's northern desert near Arica, a remote, mountainous region that has increasingly become a focal point for smugglers of both contraband and people. Police said the product came from Bolivia. Chile is largely off the beaten track for the region's drug traffickers, but several recent high profile drug-related crimes in the capital Santiago and the desert hinterlands have put authorities in the South American nation on alert. Escobar, Colombia's best-known drug lord, was the head of the infamous Medellin cartel. He died during a police operation in 1993.

        "title": "Biden played 'sheriff' on '09 aid, now salesman on COVID law",
        "full article": "WASHINGTON (AP) - In 2009, then-Vice President Joe Biden was \"Sheriff Joe,\" the enforcer making sure federal dollars from a massive economic aid package were getting to the right places and quickly. This time, President Biden\u00b4s role is different: He's lead salesman for the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid package, eager to score political points as Americans begin to reap benefits from the massive government relief effort. Biden signed the bill into law Thursday and then extolled it in a prime-time address to the nation that night. On Friday, he celebrated the package again, this time with Democratic lawmakers in his first Rose Garden event as president. Biden said Friday that he would draw on his experiences in 2009, saying he worked four to five hours daily for six months to ensure that the stimulus succeeded. That same type of focus will be needed for coronavirus relief. \"The devil is in the details,\" the president said. \"It\u00b4s one thing to pass the American Rescue Plan. It\u00b4s going to be another thing to implement it. It\u00b4s going to require fastidious oversight to make sure there\u00b4s no waste or fraud and the law does what it\u00b4s designed to do. And I mean it. We have to get this right.\" The White House has plotted an ambitious campaign to showcase the law's contents while looking to build momentum for future, more difficult parts of the president\u00b4s sweeping agenda. Biden will travel to the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Georgia next week to talk it up and other top administration officials will fan out around the country to do likewise.          President Joe Biden speaks about the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief package, in the Rose Garden of the White House, Friday, March 12, 2021, in Washington. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., left, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., listen. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  West Wing aides say there is a determination to avoid the mistakes of more than a decade earlier, when President Barack Obama\u00b4s administration didn't do enough to promote its own economic recovery plan. But Biden gets a measure of credit for the successful implementation of the plan itself, according to veterans of the Obama administration. Biden wound up with oversight of the government\u00b4s mammoth $787 billion stimulus plan after he wrote Obama a memo about how it should be run, and he savored his role as the program\u00b4s top cop. He said he had not \"yet\" looked at his vice president, Kamala Harris, to play the same role on COVID-19 aid. Back then, Biden held weekly conference calls with mayors, governors and others to press for wise use of the money. He estimated that he spoke with over 160 mayors and every governor but one - Alaska Republican Sarah Palin, who was the vice presidential nominee in the 2008 election. Biden also called regular Cabinet meetings to keep the Washington end of the program on track. At one 2009 Cabinet meeting, Biden pressed federal officials to give him a quick heads-up when projects fell behind schedule, saying, \"You\u00b4ve gotta give me more ammo so I can pick up the phone and be the sheriff.\" Biden used his role as \"Sheriff Joe\" to cut red tape and \"get the stimulus itself into the economy,\" said Robert Gibbs, who was Obama\u00b4s press secretary at the time. He predicted that Biden would be equally relentless in selling the relief package this time. \"I would be surprised if two days passed in the next four years when you don\u00b4t hear discussion about the legislation,\" Gibbs said. \"This is so important that it is literally something you say during the last rally of your reelection campaign.\" Biden is expected to appoint someone to oversee implementation of the COVID-19 relief plan. And while Biden himself will not be as in-the-weeds this time, aides still expect to get plenty of questions from him about exactly where and when the money is moving. \"He will play a different role: He is also the commander-in-chief and overseeing an economic recovery, overcoming the pandemic and addressing a range of crises,\" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. \"But in his soul, he is a details guy and he will want to roll up his sleeves and call the local mayor, governor, school district to make sure the money gets out the door.\" There are challenges that lie ahead for Biden, although White House aides point to polling that shows the package is popular with Republican voters even though not a single GOP lawmaker voted for it. No Republicans attended the Rose Garden victory lap. Biden\u00b4s White House has embraced the strategy of under-promising and then over-delivering, allowing it to frequently beat target dates and goals on, for instance, vaccine distribution. But in his speech Thursday night, Biden laid out an ambitious timeline for all adult Americans to be eligible for the vaccine by May 1 and dangled the prospects of life getting closer to normal by July 4. And while he attached caveats about a possible virus surge, Biden's new timeline generated pressure to meet the bold headlines it produced. Republicans, who are trying to label the COVID-19 relief bill as partisan, believe that they will be able to mount a far more effective pushback to the Biden administration when the president moves into more polarizing parts of his agenda such as immigration, climate change and voting rights. \"Less than two months into his presidency, and Biden is showing he never truly meant his promises of bipartisanship and unity,\" said GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. \"Instead of working on meaningfully targeted relief legislation with Republicans, he chose a hyper-partisan bill full of pork.\" The Obama bill faced headwinds because it followed the bailout of the banks, engineered under President George W. Bush, and came as the economy remained stagnant. This time, Americans will start seeing the impact much sooner - some will even see their $1,400 stimulus check deposited this weekend. Economic forecasts also project a robust recovery by year\u00b4s end, and Biden should be able to point to concrete job growth, making it an easier victory to sell than the one in 2009. Jennifer Palmieri, former communications director in the Obama White House, said Obama had to make the case that \"things are still bad but would be worse than they are if we had not passed this.\" In contrast, she said, Biden is able to tell Americans \"there are signs of life and hope and growth.\" She added: \"The White House should feel empowered: The message to be drawn from the COVID bill is that Republicans in D.C. are out of touch with the rest of the country. Time to step on the gas.\" ___ Associated Press writer Nancy Benac contributed.

        "title": "Jake DeBrusk, Bruins out to continue momentum vs. Rangers",
        "full article": "A night on the bench looks as if it might represent a turning point in winger Jake DeBrusk's season. He could take the Boston Bruins with him. DeBrusk scored just his second goal of the season in the Bruins' 4-0 victory over the New York Rangers on Thursday. The 24-year-old, a healthy scratch two nights prior for poor effort, played with a level of new energy he'll look to maintain as the teams square off again in Boston on Saturday afternoon. \"Any time you get scratched, it stinks,\" said DeBrusk, who scored 27 goals just two seasons ago. \"I was pretty beyond frustrated already. It was a nice little reset for me, because I knew I was gonna come with some heat.\" Center David Krejci also got off the schneid with his first goal of the season Thursday, while top-line forwards Patrice Bergeron (shorthanded goal, assist) and Brad Marchand (three assists) were in typical form. The Bruins won for just the fourth time in their past 11 games (4-5-2). The shutout extended Boston's run of allowing a goal or less in regulation to six straight games, but the team entered the contest 2-1-2 during the run. The four-goal explosion was a needed showing for the Bruins -- one that could become more commonplace if DeBrusk gets going. \"When he scores, he catches fire,\" Marchand said. \"Jake did a great job responding and having a big game tonight. Even more than his goal, I liked his details. He was stopping on pucks, competing hard, finishing checks, blocking shots. That's how he has to play.\" The Rangers, meanwhile, are back at the drawing board. New York won three straight last week but has dropped three games since. Thursday's shutout was its fourth of the season and second in four meetings with Boston. \"We've got to dust ourselves off and get ready to play a game Saturday,\" coach David Quinn said. Big help could be on the way soon in the form of star winger Artemi Panarin, who returned to practice Wednesday after taking a leave of absence amid unsubstantiated assault allegations that surfaced in his native Russia. Panarin, an MVP candidate with 95 points last season, hasn't played since Feb. 20 and missed Thursday's game as he gets his legs back under him. His availability Saturday has yet to be determined. \"We're all happy he's here, and nobody's happier than he is that he's back,\" Quinn said. While Panarin could help offensively, the Rangers also would benefit from increased consistency in net. The team has allowed at least four goals in each game during its current skid. Alexandar Georgiev was pulled in the second period Thursday after getting scored on four times in 14 shots, and Keith Kinkaid made 13 stops the rest of the way. On the other end of the ice, Bruins backup goalie Jaroslav Halak stopped all 27 shots he faced for his second shutout of the season. Halak has made back-to-back starts while Tuukka Rask is sidelined by a lingering injury. -Field Level Media",

        "full article": "ISTANBUL, March 12 (Reuters) - Turkey recorded 14,941 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed on Friday, the highest daily rise this year, less than two weeks after President Tayyip Erdogan announced an easing of curbs. The daily tally has roughly doubled from a month ago, a rise authorities have blamed on new variants of the coronavirus. Erdogan announced a partial opening of schools, cafes and restaurants last week. Turkey also eased weekend lockdowns, after the number of new cases fell below 10,000 daily. Friday's data showed 66 people died due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, raising the death toll to 29,356. The total number of cases rose to 2,850,930 as of Friday, the data showed. Turkey, with a population of 83 million, has administered about 10.87 million vaccine doses in a campaign that began in mid-January. More than 7.88 million people have received a first shot and nearly 2.99 million a second dose of the vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech. Turkey aims to vaccinate 50 million people by the Autumn. (Reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Andrew Heavens)",

        "full article": "By Alan Baldwin March 12 (Reuters) - Mercedes, Red Bull and McLaren bosses, whose teams were the top- three in Formula One last year, have given their backing to proposed Saturday sprint qualifying races. The sport is expected to confirm the experiment, which would award championship points on Saturday as well as in Sunday's race, for a limited number of the season's planned 23 grands prix. The sprint race would effectively serve as qualifying for Sunday's main event. The teams are due to have further discussions in Bahrain this weekend. \"There's always a million reasons why not to do something, but I think the concept's interesting,\" Red Bull boss Christian Horner told reporters on the first day of pre-season testing on Friday. \"I think the way they\u00b4re looking at introducing it is reasonably responsible over three events, so why don't we try it? Let's give it a go.\" New Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali told the Daily Mail newspaper this week that one of the sprint races would be at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Formula One sources have also mentioned Canada's Montreal, Italy's Monza and Brazil's Interlagos as other potential hosts of sprint races although the calendar could change due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said the format could boost television viewing figures considerably. \"I've seen it in DTM touring cars that we were almost able to double the TV audiences with the second race,\" said the Austrian. \"I think we should give it a go and then be really honest to ourselves what was the financial impact, and impact on the eyeballs, that we were able to generate more and what is the show factor?\" McLaren's Andreas Seidl said the devil was in the details but there was now a good proposal on the table. \"I think we will come to a final conclusion during this weekend, and then it's down to Formula One,\" added the German. Aston Martin's four times world champion Sebastian Vettel said last week that sprint races made no sense to him but drivers asked on Friday, including double champion Fernando Alonso, were supportive.

The cupboard could have been accessed by a pupil at any time.'         Angela Simonson, 66, had been a teacher at Central Primary School, Port Talbot, for 12 years\u00a0 \u00a0Christine Jarvis, then a lunchtime supervisor, said Mrs Simonson was 'stumbling and needed something to help her stand upright' in the playground during the lunchtime break.She added: 'It was like she was using the wall to help her stand.'Mrs Simonson was not behaving normally. She didn't do what she usually did. Instead of coming to the front of the line of children she leaned against the wall, she staggered to the classroom.'She knocked into one of the children, waved her hands in the air and leaned against the wall.'She was quite literally falling over drunk.'Mrs Simonson, who was not present at the EWC hearing, said in a written statement that she could 'neither recall nor explain' what headteacher Mr Toft was describing.

It is impossible that this small amount of alcohol would have caused my unsteadiness.'Jonathan Toft, who worked alongside her as a Year 4 teacher, said 'I realised I could smell alcohol on Angela.

An open can of Belgian beer Stella was found in an unlocked cupboard which could have been discovered by a schoolchild'She was slurring, staggering and stinking of drink. We could smell it in the room, everybody could smell it'.A teacher for 40 years, Mrs Simonson was described as a 'lovely teacher that was quite eccentric' and a 'lovely person with an exuberant character'.In her closing remarks, presenting officer Cadi Dewi, said 'These were primary school-age children, aged eight and nine, she was their teacher.'It was morally reprehensible behaviour and it was very clearly unacceptable.'As well as finding that she was present at work on one of more occasion between 1-8 December 2014, smelling of alcohol, having consumed alcohol before or at work or was under the influence of alcohol, they ruled these breaches amounted to a 'lack of integrity and unacceptable professional conduct'.Banning her for two years lay chair Steve Powell said 'She has not demonstrated any significant insight into her behaviour - instead of addressing her shortcomings, Mrs Simonson repeated her conduct in a single week in December 2014.'In her response to the concerns raised, she has not presented as an individual who took the concerns sufficiently seriously.'She must provide regular assessments to the Education Workforce Council about her health in order to assess her fitness to work if she wishes to return to the profession.",

        "title": "Large asteroid to pass by Earth next week",
        "full article": "The largest asteroid predicted to pass by Earth this year will be at its closest to the planet next week before being thrown back out into space, Nasa has said. While the interplanetary interloper will not come closer than 1.25 million miles from Earth, it will present a scientific opportunity for astronomers. Called 2001 FO32, the near-Earth asteroid will make its closest approach on March 21 at a distance that is equivalent to five-and-a-quarter times the distance from the Earth to the Moon. There is no threat of a collision with our planet now or for centuries to come, Nasa said. Paul Chodas, director of the Centre for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), which is managed by Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said: \u201cWe know the orbital path of 2001 FO32 around the Sun very accurately, since it was discovered 20 years ago and has been tracked ever since.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is no chance the asteroid will get any closer to Earth than 1.25 million miles.\u201d However, because the distance is close in astronomical terms, the rock has been designated a \u201cpotentially hazardous asteroid\u201d. During its approach, 2001 FO32 will pass by at about 77,000mph \u2013 faster than the speed at which most asteroids encounter Earth. The reason for the asteroid\u2019s unusually fast close approach is its highly inclined and elongated (or eccentric) orbit around the Sun \u2013 an orbit that is tilted 39 degrees to Earth\u2019s orbital plane. This orbit takes the asteroid closer to the Sun than Mercury and twice as far from the Sun as Mars. As the asteroid makes its inner solar system journey, it picks up speed like a skateboarder rolling down a halfpipe, and then slows after being flung back out into deep space and swinging back towards the Sun. It completes one orbit every 810 days. The asteroid, which analysis suggests is 1,300 to 2,230 feet (440 to 680 metres) wide,\u00a0 will not come this close to Earth again until 2052.",

        "full article": "By Ted Hesson and Jarrett RenshawWASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. health officials will limit the information they share with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to try to persuade more parents and relatives of unaccompanied migrant children to come forward and take the minors into custody, U.S. officials said on Friday during a call with reporters.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and ICE will roll back a 2018 information-sharing agreement between the agencies as part of U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to deal with a rising number of children arriving at the border, the officials said.Immigrant advocates had criticized the agreement, saying it discouraged potential sponsors from coming forward due to fears they or their family members could be deported.\"This makes really clear that this administration prioritizes uniting a child with their family member or sponsor,\" one official said on the call.The number of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has climbed in recent months as Biden, a Democrat, has reversed some of the restrictive policies put in place by former President Donald Trump, a Republican.More than 3,600 migrant children were being held in U.S. border facilities as of Thursday morning, a U.S. official told Reuters, more than four times the number in late February. The increase signals a growing humanitarian and political crisis for the Biden administration seven weeks into his presidency.Biden faces pressure from Republicans and some Democrats to address the rising border arrests, but his administration does not currently plan to seek additional funding from Congress, another one of the officials said on Friday.HHS will continue to share sponsors' home addresses with ICE through a discharge form related to a child's immigration court case, according to three people familiar with the matter.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and HHS have signed a new agreement governing how information related to unaccompanied minors can be shared, DHS said in a news release on Friday.The agencies did not immediately release the text of the new agreement.

        "title": "Israel's Ultra-Orthodox Jews get COVID vaccine but still face resentment",
        "full article": "By Maayan Lubell JERUSALEM, March 12 (Reuters) - Outside the synagogue in Jerusalem's Ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood Har Nof, a poster bears the name of Osnat Ben Sheetrit, a pregnant mother of four who died of COVID-19, and the words: \"For the ascension of her soul, get vaccinated.\" The stark message is part of a health ministry campaign aimed at Israel's 1.2 million Ultra-Orthodox Jews, the community that was the hardest hit by the coronavirus but also blamed by many secular Israelis for prolonging the pandemic by ignoring lockdown rules. Now the rate of infections among the Haredim, as they are known in Israel, has dropped sharply, falling below the national average for the first time since the pandemic broke out. Cases of severe illness have also dropped, and vaccine take-up is at 72%, a comparatively high rate globally although still below the national rate of 86% in Israel. The shift comes on the back of a decree from the Haredim's leading rabbis, who for some hold far more authority in their communities than the state, to endorse the vaccine as Israel began its national roll-out in late December. \"I personally went to rabbinical classes and sat with the rabbis and with the public,\" said Ran Balicer of Clalit, Israel's biggest healthcare provider. \"The bottom line was that the rabbis have declared the rabbinical verdict that the vaccine is safe and effective and should be taken.\" The decision was a turning point for the community ravaged by the virus, where by February, one in every 100 Israeli ultra-Orthodox Jews above the age of 60 had died of COVID-19 - nearly six times higher than among their mainstream peers. The Haredim, who make up about 12% of Israel's 9.3 million population, comprise 28% of the total recorded 800,000 coronavirus cases, according to Eran Segal, data scientist at Israel\u00b4s Weizmann Institute of Science. However, things are looking up. According to the health ministry, they now make up about the same share of new cases as their relative share of the population, even a little less, and have also seen the largest drop in severe illness than any other sector since a third wave peaked in mid-January. RESENTMENT Yet even as Israel's world-leading vaccination rollout begins to haul the country out of the depths of the pandemic, there will be no quick end to the social and political toll on the Ultra-Orthodox. \"When a Haredi man gets on a bus everyone looks at him like he\u00b4s a leper so Haredim feel persecuted, there's a lack of empathy toward them,\" said Ronny Numa, who heads the health ministry\u00b4s ultra-Orthodox task-force. A protracted electoral stalemate sees Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu going into his fourth election in two years on March 23, with Ultra-Orthodox parties a mainstay of his right-wing coalition. And although Netanyahu won plaudits at home and abroad for the vaccine rollout, prolonged lockdowns were crippling the economy. Many blamed the Haredim, some of whose rabbis instructed followers to defy the law and send pupils to class, angering mainstream Israelis, whose schools remained shut. \"You could see (lockdown) violations in every Israeli sector ... but what happened in the Haredi community ... is that the violations came from the leadership,\" said Yair Ettinger, a religious affairs analyst for Israel\u00b4s public broadcaster Kan. In addition, Netanyahu was seen as ignoring blatant lockdown violations among the ultra-Orthodox for what critics say are political reasons. The anger grew when evening news shows aired pictures of mass funerals attended by thousands of Haredim crammed together in the street, and social networks filled with videos of large weddings and holiday celebrations. Numa said that on the ground the overwhelming majority of the Haredim kept lockdown. Ultra-Orthodox leaders said their community was being unfairly scrutinized. Compliance, or a lack thereof, has not been the only factor in how the Haredim fared during the pandemic - it spread fast within the close-knit community whose large families live in densely populated neighbourhoods and towns. Shunning secular culture, many ultra-Orthodox were slow to get information about the pandemic that other Israelis got through television, newspapers and the internet. In addition, with seven children per average ultra-Orthodox family, most often living in a small home, lockdown was a struggle for many of the Haredim who did abide by it. \"We don\u00b4t have Zoom, it was all done over the telephone, every family had to get hold of phones and each child had to find a quiet space in the house,\" Chadad said. While most Israeli schoolkids were kept learning remotely in virtual class, the Haredim remained cut off. But Chadad said the worst was now behind Israel's Haredim. \"We are overcoming coronavirus. With God's help we'll be a light unto the nations and return to normal life quickly.\" (Additional reporting by Dedi Hayun and Ronen Zvulun; Writing by Maayan Lubell Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)",

        "full article": "Nonprofit advocates have hailed Congress\u00b4 passage of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief measure that has the potential to lift millions of people out of poverty at a scale not seen since the New Deal. The legislation, signed by President Joe Biden on Thursday, expands a key loan program for nonprofits, boosts AmeriCorps funding and enacts or expands several programs aimed at providing direct relief to individuals. Independent Sector, an advocacy coalition of foundations and nonprofits, said the legislation \"contains important and hard-fought victories for the nonprofit sector and the people we serve during Covid-19 and these challenging economic times.\" However, the statement also complained that lawmakers omitted an expansion of the charitable deduction and said the Paycheck Protection Program is still far too restrictive. Following is a summary of the key provisions of the measure that nonprofit advocates have been watching. AMERICORPS          President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief package, in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, March 11, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  The legislation includes nearly $1 billion in funding over three years for AmeriCorps to expand national-service programs to respond to the pandemic. That\u00b4s a big boost: AmeriCorps budgets in recent years have hovered around $1 billion a year. The funding will be primarily directed to existing programs to increase the living allowances paid to AmeriCorps members and expand their ranks, though AmeriCorps officials are still sorting out the details. Samantha Warfield, a spokeswoman for AmeriCorps, said the measure will provide \"bold, targeted investments we need in order to support the administration\u00b4s top priority of providing immediate relief for the pandemic.\" She added that AmeriCorps can expand quickly. AnnMaura Connolly, head of Voices for National Service, a group that lobbies in support of national-service programs, said the legislation\u00b4s provisions that increase the stipend paid to AmeriCorps members - which currently ranges from about $1,120 to $2,230 a month for AmeriCorps Vista members - will be crucial to expanding the economic appeal of national-service positions. \"While the language in the bill is not particularly directive, they do identify some priorities, and an important one is to increase the living allowance of those that serve, because it\u00b4s very hard to serve if you don\u00b4t have additional support,\" said Connolly. \"That\u00b4s very important from a diversity and equity perspective, and it will allow the corporation to put more boots on the ground and to fill gaps as they are needed.\" Jesse Colvin, CEO of Service Year Alliance, said the national-service provisions were a \"monumental\" first step for the Biden administration\u00b4s national service plans. \"It will provide new, and previously out of reach, opportunities to young Americans who are eager to serve and sets the stage for President Biden, who has the opportunity to make service a cornerstone issue of his administration,\" said Colvin in a statement. The additional funding includes: - $620 million for AmeriCorps\u00b4 state and national programs, which provide grants to local nonprofits to hire AmeriCorps members for designated projects. - $148 million for the National Service Trust, a program that pays off some student loans for AmeriCorps alumni. - $80 million boost for AmeriCorps Vista, which works with local nonprofits and governments on anti-poverty programs. EXPANDED LOANS FOR NONPROFITS Under a stimulus bill enacted in March 2020, nonprofits with 500 or fewer employees were eligible for forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans of up to $10 million. The new stimulus measure expands that eligibility to nonprofits that operate at multiple locations as long as no more than 500 employees work at any single location, according to the National Council of Nonprofits. HELP FOR NONPROFITS THAT SELF-INSURE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS The measure extends and expands help for nonprofits that self-insure unemployment benefits. Under previous stimulus legislation, the federal government covered half the costs of benefits provided to their laid-off employees. The new legislation would expand the reimbursement rate to 75 percent from April 1 through Sept. 6. HELP FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS The legislation will provide $350 billion for state, local and tribal governments. Nonprofit advocates say the money will prevent states and local governments from delaying or cutting payments to charities that have service contracts with them. HELP FOR PEOPLE IN POVERTY The Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University estimates that the stimulus measure will reduce child poverty by nearly half, and nonprofit advocates say that will reduce demand on overburdened charities. It provides $1,400 in direct payments to most Americans in addition to the $600 in aid provided in the December stimulus bill. The legislation also extends emergency unemployment benefits beyond their March expiration date to September 6 and increases the child tax credit. It provides $20 billion in rental assistance plus $510 million for the FEMA Emergency Food and Shelter Program to support organizations that provide services to homeless people. ___ This article was provided to The Associated Press by the Chronicle of Philanthropy.

        "full article": "The Duchess of Sussex has made a formal complaint to Ofcom about Piers Morgan after he dismissed her account of suffering suicidal thoughts and experiencing racism at the hands of the royal family.Meghan complained to ITV bosses about the former co-host of Good Morning Britain after he said on-air that he 'didn't believe a word' of her interview with chat show host Oprah Winfrey when she laid bare her struggles.She raised concerns with ITV about the effect Morgan's comments may have on the issue of mental health generally and those attempting to deal with their own problems - and not about the former newspaper editor's personal attack on herself.Morgan quit the broadcaster's breakfast show on Tuesday after an on-air row with a colleague who criticised him for 'continuing to trash' the duchess - but he later repeated his condemnation of her interview.It has now emerged Meghan's complaint is one of the 41,000 received by Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, which is expected to investigate Morgan's comments that came the morning after the Oprah Winfrey interview aired on ITV.

I'm so sorry for that family who we all love so much.'The Duke of Cambridge spoke out in defence of the monarchy on Thursday, saying 'we're very much not a racist family'.         During the bombshell interview (pictured), Harry accused an unnamed member of his family of racism and said the lack of support he and his wife received from the other royals was behind their decision to quit the UKAnd in a Buckingham Palace statement released this week, the royal family said it was taking 'very seriously' the couple's allegation that a member of the family - not the Queen or Duke of Edinburgh - raised concerns about how dark their son Archie's skin tone might be before he was born.But the duke and duchess' popularity with the public has fallen to its lowest level according to a YouGov poll, after they accused a member of the royal family of bigotry.Meghan and Harry appeared vulnerable at times as they talked about the pressures of their former lives before they stepped down as working royals and moved to America.Yet a YouGov poll, that questioned 1,664 adults between March 10-11, found Harry's positive rating with people fell 8 percent to 45 percent while Meghan's was 31% also down 8% - compared with a survey conducted between March 1-2.While those who said they felt negatively about the duke increased 7 percent to 48 percent, and the duchess' disapproval rating rose 5 percent to 58 percent.Meanwhile, in a sign of unwavering show of support, Britons continue to be most fond of the Queen, with four in five people (80 per cent) liking her, the survey says.Prince William and his wife Kate also remain very popular, according to the poll, with about three quarters of Britons giving them favourable reviews.Prince Andrew remains by far the most unpopular royal, with an 82 per cent negative view, according to the poll.According to the data, of more than 1,600 Britons between March 10 and 11, public opinion of Prince Harry is now negative - having previously been positive prior to Sunday night's world exclusive interview.

He also won the US Celebrity Apprentice in 2007, which featured former US President Donald Trump.Moving on from his past success, and his departure from GMB, Piers remains a highly popular MailOnline\u00a0columnist in both the UK and US. He was appointed editor-at-large of the publication's US operation in September 2014.\u00a0Advertisement\n\u00a0 Queen and Prince Charles back angry Prince William after he broke family silence to blast back at Harry and Meghan's race claims and insist royals are 'very much NOT racist'By Rebecca English Royal Editor For The Daily Mail and Rory Tingle For MailonlineThe Queen and\u00a0Prince Charles backed Prince William\u00a0on Thursday night after he insisted the royals were 'very much not a racist family'.William yesterday became the first senior Windsor to address directly the string of allegations made by Harry and Meghan in their explosive Oprah Winfrey\u00a0interview.\u00a0He also confirmed the depth of the rift between him and his brother.William admitted he had not even spoken to Harry about the TV show \u2013 four days after it aired.\u00a0His reaction laid bare his clear hurt over the claims made by his brother and sister-in-law.The prince's comments were praised by insiders, who said the 38-year-old did 'very well given the emotion and enormity of it all'.Last night, royal insiders claimed that although William and Harry have not spoken in months, the elder brother is prepared to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the Duke of Sussex at the unveiling of a statue of their late mother.Sources told the Mirror\u00a0'both camps are prepared to come together' and put on a 'united front' when the tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales is installed at\u00a0Kensington Palace on July 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0           The Queen and Prince Charles (pictured together in 2019) have backed Prince William after he spoke out to insist the Royal Family are 'very much not a racist family' as the fallout from Harry and Meghan's bombshell interview continues to grow       The source added:\u00a0'Tensions are undoubtedly running high but they both realise it is important to put any differences aside for the ceremony at least.'There is definitely a feeling that both camps are prepared to come together and put on a united front for such a special occasion.'Buckingham Palace and Clarence House, the official homes of the Queen and the Prince of Wales, were both said to be supportive of William's solo intervention on Thursday.The prince was speaking as he and his wife Kate visited a school in east London to support a youth mental health support service.\u00a0Aides had\u00a0initially insisted the couple would not answer questions about the interview because it would 'not be appropriate' in a school setting.This is not unusual on official engagements because royals like to keep the focus on the issue and the individuals they are supporting. But it is understood the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also determined not to amend their programme to avoid the subject.When Sky News reporter Inzamam Rashid shouted out two questions on their departure William did not blink. 'Sir, have you spoken to your brother since the interview?' he asked.The prince replied tersely: 'I haven't spoken to him yet, but I will do.'              Terse: William yesterday answered questions called out by Sky reporter on London school visit with Kate and an unnamed woman on whether the Royal Family was racist. 'We're very much NOT a racist family,' William replied to the questionThe Daily Mail understands that the once-inseparable brothers have not spoken for months. As William and Kate walked on, the reporter persisted: 'Can you just let me know, is the Royal Family a racist family?'William turned so his voice could be heard and said, clearly and firmly, despite his mask: 'We're very much not a racist family.'The frustration in his voice, and on his face, was clear.

They were welcomed by co-head teachers, Stephanie Shaldas and Edmund Coogan, and were introduced to some of the youngest pupils at a play session.Kate, in a pink Max & Co coat, knelt down to talk to children in a pop-up cafe, while William helped a girl building a wall in the playground's construction area.\u00a0Later he sat on a raised floor talking to a little boy who was brandishing a clipboard as Kate went to a water play area and then joined children in a sand pit hunting for treasure.'Is it fun to be back with all your friends?' she asked them.Kate and William then joined teachers and staff involved in the Mentally Healthy Schools project to talk about its aims and impact on children.They sat in a circle outside the school because of Covid restrictions. After the television reporter's questions were fired at William, it looked as though he may have apologised to Miss Shaldas for bringing his family's traumas into the playground.Andrea Silvain, a deputy head at the 1,200-pupil free school, said the last year of lockdowns had brought teachers and parents closer together and families had appreciated the help that the mental health website had given.'We've had some very positive feedback from parents,' she said.'People have been through this lockdown together,' William replied.Children at School 21, which educates around 1,200 pupils aged from four to 18, will be given access to lessons on issues such as anxiety and depression.Ironically, the lessons are on a website financed from an initial \u00a3800,000 grant from the then royal foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.Kate has championed the idea of early intervention by experts to help children struggling with mental health problems.",

        "title": "Figure skating-Chen more anxious about travel than world championships",
        "full article": "By Steve Keating March 12 (Reuters) - A haircut, double-masking and a few prayers will all be part of Nathan Chen's preparations as the American heads to Stockholm to defend his world championship figure skating singles title with the cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic hanging over the competition. The double world champion told reporters he was looking forward to renewing his great rivalry with Japan's twice Olympic champion Hanyu Yuzuru at the March 22-28 event but was not so excited about his first international flight in over a year. \"I can't lie and say I'm not (anxious)),\" said Chen. \"I know in theory airplanes are safe but there's still an issue, especially on international flights, where people will be taking off their masks to eat and bathrooms are always sketchy. \"So I have my anxieties about the travel but I will do my very best to keep my mask from slipping and obviously double masking throughout the flight and praying I don't get sick.\" Chen's concerns don't end with the travel. The 21-year-old also wants to see strict health and safety protocols enforced after being less than impressed with how some other events were run during the pandemic. Sweden, a country of 10 million people, has shunned lockdowns during the pandemic and has a death rate per capita many times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours. There will be no spectators inside the Globe Arena. \"Number one (concern) is making sure everyone is being responsible about wearing their masks, social distancing, taking this seriously,\" said Chen. \"Not to name names but I have seen how events have been run the past year and things didn't seem to be structured well. \"As long as everyone's staying proactive and being responsible about the requirements, what they're supposed to do, as well as having repercussions for not wearing masks or doing other things, I think that'd be better.\" Due to the pandemic Chen has not competed much in the last year, skating in just two events. Since a crushing fifth-place finish at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, Chen has not lost a competition, including a fifth consecutive U.S. national title in January. Chen has no plans to change the routines that carried him to victory in Las Vegas but acknowledged that without competition he had not got all the feedback he might have received. \"I think that not having competitions is actually kind of a loss just because you learn so much at competitions,\" said the mop-topped skater who has a haircut on his to do list. \"In training, you come in every day and you're a little bit more consistent with them (the routines) but you don't necessarily have, like, weird variables thrown your way. \"Not having competitions makes you kind of forget that sort of rhythm,\" he added.

        "full article": "Students at the University of Manchester have passed a vote of no confidence in its vice-chancellor. Dame Nancy Rothwell has faced opposition over the university\u2019s handling of the pandemic during the academic year, which included the erection of security fences around students\u2019 halls of residence. Students have now delivered a vote of no confidence in Dame Nancy and her senior management team. Some 89% of the students who took part in a referendum said they agreed with the statement that the student body had \u201cno confidence\u201d in the vice-chancellor and other leaders at the institution. The vote is non-binding and it will have to be considered by the university\u2019s board of governors. BREAKING! 89% (4590 votes) of students voted that they had no confidence in Nancy Rothwell and the Senior Leadership Team in the referendum! They have failed the students for the last time, now it is clear that students will fight for democracy and accountability.\u2014 Nancy Out | Vote YES on 8th March (@nancyoutuom) March 12, 2021   In November last year, Dame Nancy told BBC Newsnight that she had apologised to 19-year-old student Zach Adan who was allegedly racially profiled by security guards as he returned to his halls of residence.          Students at University of Manchester\u00b4s Fallowfield campus (Joe Hindley/PA)  The incident came amid ongoing protests by students who were campaigning for rent reductions after their face-to-face classes were halted and they experienced a series of issues with accommodation. As part of the protests, students occupied the Owens Park Tower building in Fallowfield. Protests also erupted on campus during the autumn term as the second lockdown began in England when a wire fence was erected overnight around accommodation without students being consulted. Students pulled down the barriers on the University of Manchester\u2019s Fallowfield campus in protest. The referendum was held by the Students\u2019 Union after a petition met the threshold number of signatures to trigger a vote. A total of 4,590 students backed the no-confidence motion. A spokesperson for the student-led campaign group, which has been calling for Dame Nancy to be removed from her post, said: \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that the positions of Nancy Rothwell and her management are completely untenable having lost the support of the staff, students and thus the entire university. \u201cThis is a historic vote and one we believe to be the first in the history of the University of Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent to anyone that the mistreatment of students and mishandling of the pandemic by the university over the past year has become an exemplar of how not to run a university.\u201d University and College Union (UCU) general secretary Jo Grady said: \u201cThis overwhelming vote of no confidence is no surprise. Nancy Rothwell has treated students at Manchester shamefully. \u201cShe irresponsibly brought students back to campus to secure income from fees and rent and then locked them in their accommodation, and has failed to address racial profiling on campus. \u201cUniversities should be governed democratically, with management properly reflecting the will and needs of students and staff. \u201cThose who study and work at the University of Manchester deserve better, more representative leadership. Nancy Rothwell\u2019s resignation would be a positive first step towards this.\u201d A statement from the University of Manchester\u2019s board of governors said: \u201cWe have seen the result of the student referendum and note that the turnout was 13% of our student population. \u201cThe board has been fully briefed throughout the period of the pandemic, holding additional meetings as and when required. \u201cHaving been rigorous in holding the senior leadership to account, the unanimous position of the board is that we have full confidence in them to lead the university forward, and in particular in Nancy Rothwell, who has led the university with vision, compassion and distinction for the past 10 years.\u201d It adds: \u201cWhilst our senior leaders haven\u2019t got everything right, where that has been the case, they have led from the front by apologising and have always taken action to ensure lessons are learnt and improvements are made. \u201cThe university remains focused on delivering the best learning experience possible and supporting the wellbeing of our students, staff and wider local community. Students are at the heart of our university.\u201d",

        "full article": "Serco has slammed 'misleading' claims about its role in the NHS's Test and Trace programme after Jeremy Corbyn and leading Labour MPs wrongly suggested it had bagged \u00a337billion from the scheme.\u00a0The outsourcing group has faced criticism over the controversial programme \u2013 seen as a crucial tool to tackle the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 which took months to become effective after launching in May.\u00a0But yesterday Serco said it needed to 'set the record straight' following a series of false claims by Labour politicians. The firm said it had been awarded contracts for Test and Trace worth \u00a3350m overall and that its role in the scheme is 'small'.\u00a0         However, several leading Labour politicians have continued to claim that the scheme is 'Serco-led' or that the company received \u00a337bn for its services \u2013 statements that independent charity Full Fact this week said were demonstrably false.\u00a0Serco made total revenues of \u00a33.9billion in 2020, according to its annual results.\u00a0Full Fact singled out frontbencher Rachel Reeves and former leader Corbyn for criticism, saying they had both made 'misleading' statements.\u00a0A Serco spokesman said: 'We are one of five companies managing testing centres and we are one of the two prime contractors providing call handlers to support medical contact tracers from NHS Professionals.

        "title": "Floyd family agrees to $27M settlement amidst ex-cop's trial",
        "full article": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The city of Minneapolis on Friday agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil lawsuit from George Floyd\u00b4s family over the Black man\u00b4s death in police custody, as jury selection continued in a former officer\u00b4s murder trial. Council members met privately to discuss the settlement, then returned to public session for a unanimous vote in support of the massive payout. It easily surpassed the $20 million the city approved two years ago to the family of a white woman killed by a police officer. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump called it the largest pretrial settlement ever for a civil rights claim, and thanked city leaders for \"showing you care about George Floyd.\" \"It\u00b4s going to be a long journey to justice. This is just one step on the journey to justice,\" Crump said. \"This makes a statement that George Floyd deserved better than what we witnessed on May 25, 2020, that George Floyd\u00b4s life mattered, and that by extension, Black lives matter.\" \"Even though my brother is not here, he's here with me in my heart,\" Philonise Floyd said. \"If I could get him back, I would give all this back.\" L. Chris Stewart, another attorney who worked with the family, said the size of the settlement \"changes evaluations and civil rights for a Black person when they die.\"          FILE - In this Feb. 8, 2021 file photo, A mural of George Floyd is seen in George Floyd Square in Minneapolis. The city of Minneapolis on Friday, March, 12, 2021, agreed to pay $27 million to settle a civil lawsuit from George Floyd's family over the Black man's death in police custody, as jury selection continued in a former officer's murder trial. The settlement includes $500,000 for the south Minneapolis neighborhood that includes the 38th and Chicago intersection that has been blocked by barricades since his death, with a massive metal sculpture and murals in his honor. (AP Photo/Jim Mone File)  \"And what happens is that trickles down to decisions in the communities across this country. When there is a city council or a mayor deciding, 'Oh, should we get rid of no-knock warrants, should we get rid of chokeholds, do we want to change these policies?\u00b4 They have 27 million reasons now why they should. And that will make decisions happen. That will make accountability happen.\" The settlement includes $500,000 for the south Minneapolis neighborhood that includes the 38th and Chicago intersection that has been blocked by barricades since his death, with a massive metal sculpture and murals in his honor. The city didn't immediately say how that money would be spent. Floyd was declared dead on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for about nine minutes. Floyd\u00b4s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. City Council President Lisa Bender choked up as she addressed a news conference about the settlement, saying she knew \"no amount of money\" could bring Floyd back. \"I just want you to know how deeply we are with you,\" she said to Floyd's family members. Floyd\u00b4s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Floyd\u00b4s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force. In 2019, Minneapolis agreed to pay $20 million to the family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed woman who was shot by an officer after she called 911 to report hearing a possible crime happening behind her home, to settle her family's civil rights lawsuit. Damond was white. It wasn't immediately clear how the settlement might affect the trial or the jury now being seated to hear it. Crump said the settlement is a way \"to help shape what justice looks like\" rather than waiting for a result from a legal system that many Blacks distrust. \"The one thing we know as Black people ... is there is no guarantee that a police officer will be convicted for killing a Black person unjustly in our country,\" Crump said. \"That's what history has taught us.\" Stewart said the civil case \"doesn't have anything to do with\" the trial. \"Justice doesn\u00b4t really wait,\" he said. \"It happens when it happens and it happened today.\" Ted Sampsell-Jones, a criminal law expert at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said it's additional pretrial publicity that is \"bad for the defense\" and could lead some jurors to think guilt has already been decided. \"However, this ultimately should not affect the criminal case,\" Sampsell-Jones said. \"There has already been a ton of pretrial publicity -- some of it bad for the prosecution, some of it bad for the defense. All we can do is hope that the jurors will follow Judge Cahill\u00b4s instructions and decide the case based solely on the evidence presented at trial.\" Crump and others at the news conference called for any protests during Chauvin's trial to be peaceful. Minneapolis is on edge for potential violence if Chauvin is acquitted, with concrete barriers, fencing and barbed wire encircling the courthouse and the National Guard already mobilized. Meanwhile, another potential juror was dismissed Friday after she acknowledged having a negative view of the defendant. The woman, a recent college graduate, said she had seen bystander video of Floyd's arrest and closely read news coverage of the case. In response to a jury pool questionnaire, she said she had a \"somewhat negative\" view of Chauvin and that she thought he held his knee to Floyd's neck for too long. \"I could only watch part of the video, and from what I saw as a human, I, that did not give me a good impression,\" she said. She said she did not watch the bystander video in its entirety because \"I just couldn\u00b4t watch it anymore.\" The woman repeatedly said she could put aside her opinions and decide the case on the facts, but Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson nonetheless used one of his 15 challenges to dismiss her. With jury selection in its fourth day, seven people have been seated. Cahill has set aside three weeks for jury selection, with opening statements no sooner than March 29. Potential jurors' identities are being protected and they are not shown on livestreamed video of the proceedings. Chauvin and three other officers were fired. The others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges. The defense hasn't said whether Chauvin will testify in his own defense. ___ Find AP\u00b4s full coverage of the death of George Floyd: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd          FILE - In this Feb. 8, 2021 file photo, George Floyd Square is shown in Minneapolis.

Queen Elizabeth II reminded a group of schoolchildren studying space exploration about the importance of returning to Earth as she reminisced in a video call about the first man to make the trip - Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

(Buckingham Palace via AP)  Wednesday's call with students from Thomas Jones Primary School in west London came during a difficult week for the queen, after the royal family was rocked by charges of racism and insensitivity leveled at them by Prince Harry and Meghan. But despite the controversy, the queen went ahead with her work, much like she\u00b4s done for decades. Scientists from the London Science Museum briefed her on NASA\u00b4s Mars Perseverance mission and discussed the discovery of fragments from a meteorite earlier this week in England. The group gave the queen a set of Mars Perseverance rover face masks, which were sent from NASA headquarters to Windsor Castle. Professor Caroline Smith of the Natural History Museum asked that one of the masks be given to Prince Philip, the queen\u00b4s husband, because of his long interest in science and space exploration.

        "full article": "Australian star Michael Matthews, who's already worn the yellow jersey at this year's Paris-Nice race, has came close to adding a first stage win only to find the imperious Primoz Roglic in his way again. In a tough short uphill drag to end the sixth stage, Matthews, of the Australian road outfit Team BikeExchange, pushed hard only to be ousted in the sprint by overall race leader Roglic and last year's winner Max Schachmann. It was world no.1 and Vuelta a Espana winner Roglic's second victory of the race that he's beginning to dominate. Victory on the 202.4km stage from Brignoles to Biot extended the Slovenian's overall lead to 41 seconds ahead of last year's winner Max Schachmann. BikeExchange had earlier taken control of proceedings to try to set up the stage win for their 30-year-old puncheur Matthews. \"We knew it was a good stage for us and tried to make it an easy of a sprint as we could. The boys did a great job but unfortunately, we came away with third. We gave it everything,\" said Matthews. His teammate Lucas Hamilton, BikeExchange's main general classification hope, had a good day, finishing sixth in the sprint to move to seventh overall, a minute and 16 seconds behind Roglic. \"The next two days are pretty big climbing days, and we have Lucas Hamilton in great shape so we will support him 100% and see what he can do with the big boys on the final climb,\" said Matthews. Other Australians still enjoying a decent week are Bahrain Victorious rider Jack Haig, who's 12th overall, 1:25 behind, AG2R Citroen's Ben O'Connor (15th, 1:46 down) and Team DSM's Giro d'Italia runner-up Jai Hindley (24th, 2:12 down). Saturday's tough seventh stage takes the peloton from Le Broc to La Colmiane over 199.2km after organisers were forced to change the course to avoid Nice amid a local weekend lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19.",

        "full article": "By Carl O'Donnell and Jeff Mason March 12 (Reuters) - The White House is holding onto some doses of AstraZeneca Plc's COVID-19 vaccine so they can be given to Americans quickly if authorized by the U.S. health regulator, a top administration official said Friday. AstraZeneca has produced doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, where it has yet to be approved. The vaccine developed with Oxford University has been authorized for use in the European Union and many other countries. Reuters reported this week that U.S. officials told the EU not to expect shipments of the shot from the United States anytime soon. \"We have a small inventory of AstraZeneca so, if approved, we can get that inventory out to the American people,\" White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients said in a Friday press call. The New York Times reported this week that tens of millions of doses have already been produced in the United States and are sitting in production facilities unused. AstraZeneca said in February it expects its vaccine could receive U.S. emergency use authorization at the beginning of April and could immediately deliver 30 million doses to locations around the United States. The U.S. stance could jeopardize AstraZeneca\u00b4s attempts to come closer to delivering on its contractual obligation with the EU of 180 million doses in the second quarter. AstraZeneca told the EU earlier this year it would cut its supplies in the second quarter by at least half to less than 90 million doses, EU sources told Reuters, after a bigger reduction in the first three months of the year. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday the government will first give Americans COVID-19 vaccines, but any surplus would be shared with the world. \"We...want to make sure we have maximal flexibility, that we are oversupplied and over-prepared and that we have the ability to provide vaccines, whatever the most effective ones are, to the American public,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday. \"A number of countries... have requested doses from the United States and we have not provided doses from the U.S. government to anyone,\" she added. The United States has been one of the world leaders in vaccine administration. It has distributed more than 130 million shots and administered nearly 100 million, according to federal data last updated on Thursday. White House officials said on Friday that 65% of Americans over 65 years old have been given shots.

Relatives who had traveled in the same plane from Mexico City held photographs of the dead.\"I want to express my deepest regret and condolences to the families of the 16 victims of the Camargo massacre,\" Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei said at the airport. \"We will exhaust all the options to find out who was responsible.\"Giammattei asked for a minute of silence before his speech, and expressed his condolences to every family.Every year, thousands of Central Americans and Mexicans flee poverty and violence to seek a better life in the United States. Many fall victim to crime on the perilous journey.In this case, no one has been held responsible for the killings. Investigators had said they suspected at least a dozen state police of involvement.Later in the day, the bodies will be transported to Comitancillo, in western department of San Marcos, to be buried in their place of origin.Authorities had identified the bodies using DNA samples after relatives of the missing came forward.Immigration from Central America and Mexico has returned to the forefront of regional affairs since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January vowing to roll back the hardline policies of his predecessor Donald Trump.

        "full article": "Pollution from British roads has an impact on almost every part of the country, despite the fact just 1% of the country is covered by roadways, study finds.Researchers from the University of Exeter examined maps of all British roads to find out how much land they occupy then examined data on atmospheric pollution.The most widespread forms of pollution from roads and vehicles are particulate matter, tiny particles from the burning of fossil fuels in engines, they found.Noise and light pollution were also major factors considered by the team as they examined the impact of British roads on the country as a whole.They found that even low levels of pollution from roads could harm wildlife, with the impact on human health particularly high in urban areas with greater pollution levels.Roads form a 'vast, pervasive and growing network, causing negative environmental impacts' for the entire country, the study authors warned in their paper.

After the gas is released into the atmosphere it stays there, making it difficult for heat to escape - and warming up the planet in the process.\u00a0It is primarily released from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, as well as cement production.\u00a0The average monthly concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, as of April 2019, is 413 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution, the concentration was just 280 ppm.\u00a0CO2 concentration has fluctuated over the last 800,000 years between 180 to 280ppm, but has been vastly accelerated by pollution caused by humans.\u00a0  AirVisual Privacy Policy   Nitrogen dioxide\u00a0The gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fossil fuels, car exhaust emissions and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers used in agriculture.Although there is far less NO2 in the atmosphere than CO2, it is between 200 and 300 times more effective at trapping heat.Sulfur dioxide\u00a0Sulfur dioxide (SO2) also primarily comes from fossil fuel burning, but can also be released from car exhausts.SO2 can react with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to cause acid rain.\u00a0Carbon monoxide\u00a0Carbon monoxide (CO) is an indirect greenhouse gas as it reacts with\u00a0hydroxyl radicals, removing them. Hydroxyl radicals reduce the lifetime of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\u00a0ParticulatesWhat is particulate matter?Particulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.\u00a0Some are visible, such as dust, whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.\u00a0Materials such as metals, microplastics, soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.Particulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres. The two main ones mentioned in reports and studies are PM10 (less than 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 micrometres).         Air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels, cars, cement making and agriculture\u00a0Scientists measure the rate of particulates in the air by cubic metre.Particulate matter is sent into the air by a number of processes including burning fossil fuels, driving cars and steel making.Why are particulates dangerous?Particulates are dangerous because those less than 10 micrometres in diameter can get deep into your lungs, or even pass into your bloodstream. Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads.\u00a0Health impactWhat sort of health problems can pollution cause?According to the World Health Organization, a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.\u00a0Some of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood, but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.\u00a0As well as this, almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.\u00a0Particulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there, causing inflammation and damage. As well as this, some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.\u00a0Deaths from pollution\u00a0Around seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks, strokes, various cancers and cardiovascular problems.\u00a0         \u00a0Asthma triggersAir pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways, and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.\u00a0Problems in pregnancy\u00a0Women exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects, research suggested in January 2018.Living within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips, a study by\u00a0University of Cincinnati found.For every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles, birth defects rise by 19 per cent, the research adds.\u00a0Previous research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.\u00a0What is being done to tackle air pollution?\u00a0Paris agreement on climate changeThe Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.\u00a0It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00baF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F)'.Carbon neutral by 2050\u00a0The UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.\u00a0They plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.Some critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.International carbon credits let nations\u00a0continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere, balancing out their emissions.No new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040In 2017, the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0\u00a0MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030, as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.         The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change. Pictured: air pollution over Paris in 2019.Norway's electric car subsidiesThe speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies.\u00a0Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars, which makes them competitively priced.A VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334,000 kroner (34,500 euros, $38,600), while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326,000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.\u00a0Criticisms of inaction on climate changeThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.\u00a0The committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed \u2013 from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains \u2013 and found no real progress in any of them.The UK is not prepared for 2\u00b0C of warming, the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises, let alone a 4\u00b0C rise, which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally, the committee said.It added that cities need more green spaces to stop the urban 'heat island' effect, and to prevent floods by soaking up heavy rainfall.\u00a0Advertisement",

The so-called \"Quad\" group of four nations want to expand global vaccinations and counter China's growing vaccination diplomacy in Southeast Asia and around the world. India is the world's biggest vaccine maker. The collaboration was \"most pressing and valuable\", foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told a news conference in India's capital New Delhi after the four-way virtual summit. \"The four countries have agreed to a plan to pool their financial resources, manufacturing capabilities and capacities, and logistical strengths so as to ramp up the manufacturing and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region,\" he said. \"We believe this will speed up the process of post-pandemic recovery and enable families and businesses to put the COVID-19 crisis behind them.\" India will use its manufacturing capacity to make U.S. vaccines, with financing coming from the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Australia will finance training and provide last-mile logistical support for the distribution of vaccines, he added, that will predominantly go to the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia and countries in the Indian Ocean. The initiative, however, may be hampered by U.S. export restrictions on critical raw materials for India's vaccine supply chain. Shringla said the issue is a bilateral one with the United States that has been raised by India's ambassador in Washington. \"Consideration is being given to this very important point,\" he said, without elaborating. The tie-up will not impact the production of vaccines for India's 1.4 billion people, Shringla added. (Reporting by Alasdair Pal in New Delhi and Euan Rocha in Mumbai; Editing by Hugh Lawson)",

The U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by one to 402 in the week to March 12, according to data on Friday from energy services firm Baker Hughes Co . &lt;RIG-OL-USA-BHI> &lt;RIG-OL-USA-BHI> &lt;RIG-GS-USA-BHI> That count is 390 rigs, or 49%, below this time last year. The oil and gas rig count, however, has increased for the past seven months since dropping to a record low of 244 in August, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1940. U.S. oil rigs fell one to 309 this week, while gas rigs were unchanged at 92. U.S. crude futures soared to almost $68 a barrel this week, their highest since 2018. Prices rebounded from last year's crash, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic's demand destruction. This week, the government revised down 2021's decline expected in crude production. Output is seen falling 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.15 million bpd, a smaller decrease than its previous monthly forecast for a 290,000-bpd drop. Before the pandemic, companies were cutting rigs about four rigs on a weekly basis over the prior year to focus on boosting cash flow, reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns. But a year ago, rig declines accelerated to an average of 45 per week from late March through early June, until higher prices in August spurred drillers to return to the wellpad. Enverus, which has its own rig count that showed drop of two as of March 10, noted \"This week marks one year since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and one year since companies started looking to shed rigs.\" In the last year, however, Enverus said two gas-focused regions \"have actually seen an increase in drilling\" with the Haynesville Shale in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas up three to 52 rigs and the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia up two to 44 rigs. Enverus said companies that have added the most rigs year-over-year include Marcellus and Haynesville producers like CNX Resources Corp (from zero to two), National Fuel Gas Co (from one to three) in the Marcellus and Comstock Resources Inc (from five to seven). The biggest year-over-year declines came from Exxon Mobil Corp (down 57 rigs to just eight now), ConocoPhillips (down 21 to 14) and Chevron Corp (down 19 to nine).
